1,Volvo EX30 review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volvo/ex30,"Alex Ingram, Sam Naylor",2025-07-11,Auto Express,"The Volvo EX30 has impressed us on numerous occasions. It’s a very effective small EV that is good to drive, has a minimalist interior that feels special, features plenty of standard safety features and equipment, delivers eye-opening performance coupled with a competitive electric driving range, and yet manages this all at a reasonable asking price.",4.5,33050
2,New Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E Performance review: should be fun… but isn’t,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mercedes/amg-gt/362906/new-mercedes-amg-gt-63-s-e-performance-review-should-be-funbut-isnt,Jordan Katsianis,2025-07-01,Auto Express,"Mercedes-AMG has rarely held back in the pursuit of power, and in its hybrid age none are more potent than the AMG GT 63 S E Performance. This is a wickedly fast car, and knocks on the door of hypercar-levels of straight-line speed. But the means by which the flagship GT’s performance has been achieved results in a finished product that’s hard to engage with, even if it is still mightily impressive.",3.5,10200
3,New Bentley Continental GTC Azure 2025 review: PHEV power suits luxury convertible,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bentley/continental-gt/367152/new-bentley-continental-gtc-azure-2025-review-phev-power-suits-luxury,Alastair Crooks,2025-06-23,Auto Express,"The new plug-in hybrid V8 that Bentley is rolling out across the model range feels extremely well-matched to the drop-top Bentley Continental GTC. The engine is flexible and will excite on an open road, while giving you the rich background sound you expect of a Bentley convertible. Couple this with the extra refinement of pure-electric running around town, and the GTC’s driving experience provides more layers than ever.",4.5,87995
4,Hyundai Santa Fe vs Volkswagen Tayron: which SUV is best for a big family?,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-group-tests/367026/hyundai-santa-fe-vs-volkswagen-tayron-which-suv-best-big-family,Alex Ingram,2025-06-07,Auto Express,"It’s a very closely fought contest, but the Volkswagen Tayron scrapes a narrow win. That’s because of this pair, it’s the car that will be easier to live with every day. A large part of that comes down to the way that it drives. It doesn’t seem bulky like its rival; indeed, the VW feels barely any more substantial than the smaller five-seat Tiguan upon which it’s based.",,10200
5,Mercedes Citan van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mercedes/citan,Sam Naylor,2025-05-23,Auto Express,"Mercedes’ smallest commercial offering comes with plenty of kit as standard, including the three-pointed star’s excellent MBUX infotainment system. It’s a decent all-rounder and the electric eCitan could be a good choice for some. Elsewhere, there are only two diesel engine options so the range isn’t all that wide.",4.0,10200
6,New BMW M235 2025 review: is it a proper M car?,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bmw/2-series/365150/bmw-m235-review,Tom Jervis,2025-05-23,Auto Express,"For this mid-life update, BMW has focused on making the M235 more engaging to drive and despite a decrease in power, it has succeeded… to an extent. Over and above the standard 2 Series, most of the thrills on offer here come in the form of brisk acceleration, while the handling is competent rather than playful. Better looking than before and with a plush high-tech interior, the hot 2 Series saloon is more desirable than ever, but still can’t match rivals (or other cars wearing the M badge) dynamically.",3.5,17790
7,Smart #5 review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/smart/5,Ellis Hyde,2025-05-23,Auto Express,"The Smart #5 encapsulates the phrase ‘go big or go home’. We were astounded by how well it handles, while still being comfortable, as well as by the vast amount of space inside, some of the technology onboard and the overall quality, especially for the proposed price. All-in-all, it’s a real threat to the Tesla Model Y. However, what’s holding this big, bold SUV back is the woefully inefficient powertrain that resulted in a disappointing real-world range and will make it more expensive to run than rivals.",4.0,10200

9,"Used Subaru Forester (Mk5, 2019-2024) buyer’s guide: great off road, less good on it",https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/subaru/forester/366912/used-subaru-forester-mk5-2019-2024-buyers-guide-great-road-less-good-it,Richard Dredge,2025-05-26,Auto Express,"In a very competitive segment, the Subaru Forester struggles to challenge. That’s not to say it’s a lost cause though, because this is a car that’s genuinely good off road, crammed with safety kit (and equipment in general), plus it’s pretty well put together. But Subaru didn’t put enough effort into honing the Forester’s on-road prowess, and the lack of powertrain options further limits its appeal. Now that the fifth-generation Forester is available only as a used buy, high running costs have become apparent, in part because the e-Boxer hybrid set-up isn’t as frugal as Subaru claimed.",,21106

If you’re in the market for a diesel-powered fastback SUV of this genre, then it does the job better than most; we’re just getting a little bored of this type of compromised bodystyle – and the disappearance of some rivals suggest customers feel the same.",3.5,5349
12,"New MINI JCW Electric 2025 review: fast, frantic and playful",https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mini/mini-cooper/366938/new-mini-john-cooper-works-electric-2025-review-fast-frantic-and-playful,Alex Ingram,2025-05-27,Auto Express,"John Cooper Works’ first stab at an electric hot hatch has its flaws, but it’s hard to deny that it’s a huge giggle to drive. Fast, frantic and playful, there’s an awful lot to make you smile, which is a huge hurdle that very few electric cars have managed to overcome. Still, once many prospective buyers put on their sensible hats, the cons can become too much to overlook. The small rear-seat space, the potentially limited range and particularly the relentlessly firm ride make this MINI a little harder to justify.",3.5,10200
27,MGS5 EV review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mg/mgs5,"Jordan Katsianis, Max Adams",2025-06-04,Auto Express,"The MGS5 EV takes the brand’s electric SUV range to new heights thanks to its combination of space, standard equipment and range. It also feels appropriately tuned for UK roads and is surprisingly powerful. What’s missing, though, is a sense of character or panache. As such, rivals have this MG cornered, with some offering better outright value, while other, more expensive options, feel more special.",4.0,28485
13,New Fiat Grande Panda Hybrid 2025 review: spacious supermini is far from efficient,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/fiat/grande-panda/366928/new-fiat-grande-panda-hybrid-2025-review-spacious-supermini-far-efficient,Phil McNamara,2025-05-27,Auto Express,"When it comes to the Fiat Grande Panda Hybrid – claimed to be 'Pandastic' by '90s rapper Shaggy – I’m not entirely ‘Mr Lover Lover’. That’s down to the way it drives: the ride lacks finesse and fuel consumption disappointed on the launch. Other aspects? The interior and exterior design are irresistible, the cabin and boot spacious for a supermini and the pricing is great value, making the rest an absolute smash hit.",3.5,10200

I’m still a massive fan, thanks to the car’s clever features, excellent comfort and massive boot, which has swallowed all my photographic kit with ease. The few issues I’ve had with the Superb have been minor and haven’t detracted from the overall experience.",4.5,2940
15,Renault Kangoo van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/renault/kangoo/van,Sam Naylor,2025-05-29,Auto Express,"The newest Renault Kangoo is the most efficient yet, while it features more space inside, too. It drives well, is generously equipped and the availability of petrol, diesel or electric power means there should be a version to suit. Safety kit is a strong point, although much of it is optional, and there are two wheelbase options to choose from, along with a Crew van model.",4.0,10200
16,Honda CR-V review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/honda/cr-v,"Max Adams, Alex Ingram",2025-05-29,Auto Express,"Does the Honda CR-V still stand for ‘Compact Runabout Vehicle? Well, at over 4.7 meters in length for this sixth-generation version, we wouldn’t say so. Perhaps ‘Comfortable Runabout Vehicle’? Again, we’d be inclined to say you can find several rivals that are more comfortable.",3.5,45235
17,"Used BMW X3 (Mk3, 2017-2024) buyer's guide: the sweet spot between the X1 and X5",https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bmw/x3/356834/used-bmw-x3-mk3-2017-2024-buyers-guide-sweet-spot-between-x1-and-x5,Richard Dredge,2025-05-29,Auto Express,"Of BMW's various SUVs, it's the X3 that hits the spot for many people because it's just the right size. As a result, it's more wieldy and affordable than an X5, it's more roomy and usable than an X1, but it has everything that you'd expect of a BMW: a user-friendly cabin, excellent handling, efficient engines, and refinement levels that make long-distance journeys a breeze. The first-generation X3 disappointed in some ways, but the Mk2 was far better, with the Mk3 even better in a multitude of ways. That's just as well, because by the time it appeared the X3 Mk3 was up against some very desirable and talented rivals, and we'd urge you to look at some of those alongside the BMW, because there are so many excellent options within the segment.",,10200
18,Nissan Townstar van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/nissan/townstar,Sam Naylor,2025-05-30,Auto Express,"The Nissan Townstar is a strong contender in the small van segment and the brand’s focus on the electric version makes sense. The 178-mile range of the Townstar EV is competitive and while it doesn’t redefine the laws of physics with its performance, the compact electric van is relatively comfortable, practical and has some high-end tech features, if you’re prepared to pay for them. If your business is auditioning for an urban runabout or last-mile delivery vehicle, this Nissan could play a starring role.",4.0,26545
19,Citroen Dispatch van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/citroen/dispatch,Dean Gibson,2025-05-30,Auto Express,"While the Citroen Dispatch name has been around since 1994, the current third generation was launched in 2016. It was given a facelift at the end of 2024, but the van’s overall appeal in the medium-sized van sector remains unchanged. It’s not the most spacious van in the class, but it’s quite comfortable to drive, has plenty of car-derived equipment on board and is available with either diesel or all-electric powertrains. There are two body lengths on offer, while a crew van variant offers a level of versatility that will be useful for certain businesses. Overall, it’s a decent medium-sized van with no vices and plenty of useful touches.",4.0,10200

Its low price and usable layout secure the victory from the other Screwfix offering by Magnusson. The keenly priced Silverline just edged the win among the larger bags we tested.",,10200
23,Volkswagen ID. Buzz Cargo van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/id-buzz/id-buzz-cargo,Andy Goodwin,2025-06-02,Auto Express,"If you're a business looking for a van that creates a positive impression wherever it goes, then the Volkswagen ID. Buzz Cargo could be it. It has retro-inspired looks that mean it stands out from rival vans, while its all-electric running gear offers an excellent driving range for an electric van along with very fast charging.",4.5,10200
24,Renault Trafic van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/renault/trafic,Andy Goodwin,2025-06-03,Auto Express,"This generation of Renault Trafic has been around for over a decade, but several big rounds of updates have kept it looking and feeling reasonably fresh. The latest was in 2022, ushering in an updated nose and new tech, most of which now comes as standard. In 2024 the electric Trafic E-Tech also arrived in the UK, with just as much cargo space as the diesel panel van and a respectable payload, but a fairly short driving range and charging speed that tops out at a sluggish 50kW. It could still slash bills in urban use, but for jobs further afield, one of the diesels will be a better bet.",4.5,10200
25,Volkswagen Caddy Cargo van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/caddy,Andy Goodwin,2025-06-03,Auto Express,"Thanks to its Volkswagen Golf-based underpinnings, the latest Caddy Cargo maintains its reputation for being one the best, most car-like small vans to drive. With a choice of punchy petrol or diesel engines it’s easy to pilot around town and on the motorway, while the arrival of a plug-in hybrid adds another string to its bow. Badged ‘eHybrid’ it has an electric-only range of around 70 miles, slashing its CO2 emissions for lower bills.",4.0,10200

It’s quick, efficient, very calming to cruise about in, and everyone loves its spaciousness. But black paint is hard to keep clean, the phantom error messages – such as wiper or child locking faults – bewilder and the brakes are awful.",4.0,2742

They offer great value and the best cleaning performance. Screwfix’s No Nonsense wipes take second place. They’re not quite as good at cleaning, but there are three times as many wipes in each pot compared with rivals. Sika’s Wonder Wipes are third.",,10200
30,New MINI John Cooper Works Aceman 2025 review: fun but far from perfect,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mini/aceman/366996/new-mini-john-cooper-works-aceman-2025-review-fun-far-perfect,Alex Ingram,2025-06-04,Auto Express,"Fun isn’t hard to come by in the John Cooper Works Aceman - but neither are the flaws. The rapid powertrain rarely fails to throw up a giggle, but sharp steering only manages to inject a veneer of agility over what is a very heavy - and rather numb - car for its size. The ride is too firm, and the interior space isn’t great for those in the back, but those up front are treated to a cabin that feels more special than its rivals - all the more impressive when the Aceman undercuts those competitors on price.",3.5,286
31,Cupra Formentor review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/cupra/formentor,"Shane Wilkinson, Ellis Hyde",2025-06-04,Auto Express,The Cupra Formentor has been a real success for the sporty Spanish brand since its launch back in 2020.

32,Volkswagen Transporter van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/transporter,Andy Goodwin,2025-06-04,Auto Express,"Volkswagen and Ford have joined forces, so the latest Transporter now shares a great deal with the top-selling Ford Transit Custom. Some may bemoan the fact the Transporter has lost some of its individuality as a result, but elsewhere things are very positive.",4.5,15600
33,Citroen e-C4 review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/citroen/e-c4,Dean Gibson,2025-06-04,Auto Express,"If you’re looking for a five-seat electric family car that won’t break the bank, then the Citroen e-C4 is a canny choice in a competitive market. It has plenty of room for passengers and luggage, while the soft seats and suspension mean that it delivers great comfort. The recent facelift didn’t make any drastic changes beyond the new front end, but prices have been cut by a significant amount to make the e-C4’s shortcomings in some areas (a relatively short driving range, some older on-board tech and poor efficiency at higher speeds) even easier to overlook.",4.0,27640

These coupés and cabriolets make superb cruisers with their refinement, power and comfort, but you’re unlikely to get up just to go for a blast down a B-road in one. It might lack the sparkle of a BMW 4 Series, but the A5 is hardly a duffer in this respect. It’s easy and enjoyable to drive, if not rewarding, but it is easy to live with. As with most German cars, it comes at a premium cost, but we reckon it’s a price worth paying.",,20900

If you don’t need the maximum amount of cargo volume then it could be a great choice alongside its siblings (the Vauxhall Vivaro, Peugeot Expert, Toyota Proace and Citroen Dispatch). Since all those vans are incredibly similar, the best choice for you will likely be whichever is cheapest at the time of purchase.",4.0,13325

It’s costly to buy and run, and not especially engaging to drive, plus it’s also not quite as practical as it should be for its size. But it’s incredibly refined, packed with all of the latest comfort and safety tech, has a roomy cabin, and is effortless to drive on even the longest journeys. Even at this end of the market there’s no such thing as the perfect car, with the Q8’s rivals all open to criticism. However, while we like the Audi, if you’re buying a premium XXL coupé-SUV, we’d check out a few of those alternatives before you decide.",,46000
38,Peugeot Expert van review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/peugeot/expert,Sam Naylor,2025-06-05,Auto Express,"While the Peugeot Expert was launched way back in 2016, a recent facelift means it is still very relevant to modern van buyers. Other vans in this class are more spacious inside, but the Expert is comfortable, well-equipped and has an excellent electric model available as well as the normal diesel options. Two body length options and a crew van mean there should be a version to suit most businesses, and the new design is rather modern looking, at least from the front.",4.0,10200

The Sportback version gives improved EV range and a sportier shape for a modest reduction in practicality, and a £2,500 premium.

We found it lacking personality, charm and a unique selling point that will allow it to triumph in the thunderdome that is the small electric SUV segment.

But while the Across has never been all that alluring as a new purchase, as a used buy it’s more enticing. The entry cost makes more sense, and with all Acrosses being so well equipped, as a £25k buy it’s easy to be tempted.

In reality the two cars deliver different characters, with the Kia missing out on the most focused elements that the Hyundai delivers in favour of a grand touring feel.

But if you fancy harking back to the early noughties, the Celica makes a great modern classic buy, because these are cars that are eminently practical as two-seaters, or as a family runabout if you have small kids. Although these days most of the Celica’s contemporaries are extremely rare, the Toyota’s durability means there are more to choose from.

However, although the Taycan is incredibly impressive, the e-tron GT is more comfortable and has superior in-car tech, while it’s no slower than the Porsche.

But compared with most of its rivals, it’s cramped, and thanks to its unyielding suspension it’s also uncomfortable. Depending on which exhaust system is fitted, it can also be extremely noisy. The Abarth 500 is definitely a car for enthusiasts who are willing to accept compromise, plus it looks brilliant and is sure to be a classic in years to come.

The touchscreen-only controls won’t be for everyone, and we’d like a few more physical controls to help with day-to-day driving, but the ride and handling have been improved while battery efficiency remains a strong point.

It’s larger, which means it’s more practical than many of its rivals, while a combination of plush materials and the latest tech make the interior feel more upmarket than before. The entry-level version with the smaller battery is temptingly affordable, while the larger battery offers up to 319 miles of range from a full charge.

Its striking looks, intuitive on-board tech and premium-feeling cabin help it stand out in the overcrowded mid-size SUV class, but the Tucson is a car that appeals to the head as well as to the heart. Efficiency-boosting hybrid technology and high levels of standard equipment can be found throughout the range, while the interior is one of the roomiest in the class and the boot is large enough to rival those of estate cars.",4.5,32400

But thankfully MINI has stuck with it, and the fact that the soft-top MINI was our Convertible of the Year six times in a row between 2018 and 2023, and also Carbuyer’s Best Convertible from 2018 until 2024, tells you all you need to know about this drop-top’s all-round desirability. Of course, it’s compromised by its very nature, but when it comes to the amount of fun on offer per pound, there isn’t much that can touch the MINI Convertible, which in its third-generation form is more desirable than ever.",,10200

It’s practical, high-tech, and boasts great performance and range for a competitive price. The all-electric saloon’s facelift only sweetens the deal, improving build quality and refinement, giving it a slightly snazzier look, and boosting the already excellent range up to around 400 miles in some versions. All this provides us with enough reasons to keep the Model 3 in place for the second year in a row as our top pick in the best mid-size company car category of the 2025 Auto Express New Car Awards.",4.5,39980

For such a small car, it’s both impressively spacious and comfortable, with strong equipment levels, a good-quality cabin and competitive pricing relative to the recent influx of new European competition. If it wasn't for the likes of the Citroen e-C3 and Renault 5, we’d be singing its praises even more, but those cars feel more sophisticated to drive – particularly in terms of powertrain calibration – and offer better functionality inside, keeping the surprisingly mean-looking little car off the top of the class.",4.0,10200

Around town, its clever powertrain delivers a genuinely EV-like drive, while the newly enhanced version brings noticeable improvements in refinement and fuel economy on the motorway.

The Ring RK002 is the package that offers a good selection of items at a decent price, so it takes the Best Buy.

Underneath it’s still very much one of a group of Stellantis vans with near-identical specs, so it offers the same impressive cargo volume as the Citroen Berlingo and Peugeot Partner.

Its badge may prove one challenge too far for those used to shopping for Volvos or Range Rovers, but mainstream buyers who want extra kit or more space could do a lot worse than giving the Chinese newcomer their attention. It’s no sports car, but the clever powertrain and comfortable ride make it a solid cruiser, plus its long EV range has the potential to cut costs for private buyers and company-car drivers alike.",4.0,44880

Refinement is superb, fit and finish is impressive and the cabin is fairly spacious. However, it doesn’t feel like a Mazda when two of the brand's key qualities – ergonomics and beautiful feel and feedback through the driving controls – are missing. Feeling like a Mazda was always a good reason to choose one over any of its other rivals - without that, the 6e seems like it’s lacking a USP.",3.5,10200

The Hyundai isn’t without its foibles, however.

The lack of a rear window will always be a talking point, but it’s just that, really, and doesn’t detract from the day-to-day driving experience or sophisticated interior.

This is still a small, urban-focused EV, but one that can now double as a compact family car capable of occasional long trips.

The Mistral – on behalf of all W16-era models – represents a place and time in humanity’s engineering journey that broke boundaries and pushed the limits of what a road car could be.

It strikes a good balance between comfort and driving dynamics, which means it’s well suited to UK roads, although if you’re looking for a family car that can deliver hot-hatch thrills, its size and weight mean it can’t quite deliver in that department. Prices are on the high side, too, while the eHybrid sacrifices some practicality courtesy of its large drive battery – you also need to keep the pack charged for the best efficiency and to deliver the sharpest responses from the powertrain.",4.0,38715

Its posh interior feels befitting of its price tag, while the vRS edition brings plenty of performance. Those looking for outright excitement will be left disenchanted – standard non-vRS models will be sufficient for most buyers – yet the biggest issue isn’t necessarily the Enyaq itself, but the existence of the Elroq. Smaller, cheaper and offering similar passenger space to the Enyaq, the newer car makes Skoda’s flagship feel somewhat superfluous in most cases, which is an odd thing to say about such a multi-talented vehicle.",3.5,3075

162,Mercedes CLA review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mercedes/cla,Jordan Katsianis,2025-07-16,Auto Express,"Consider this the start of Europe’s comeback tour in the car world. The new electric Mercedes CLA and its fresh platform, powertrain and interior tech represents a significant step forward across almost all key deliverables. This doesn’t just close the gap to new-age rivals in terms of range and efficiency, but creates a new standard. However, it’ll launch with one arm tied behind its back due to its incompatibility to most public fast-charging stations in the UK.",4.5,45605

It feels built to a price in a way the MG3 doesn’t, but the trade-off is a lightweight construction that provides agile handling and rock-bottom fuel costs. The Swift won’t suit everyone, but if you’re not yet ready to go electric, this car provides an affordable, familiar and honest entry into the small-car market.",3.5,19514

This sleek, comfortable, refined, and tech-filled model hits all the right notes – tight rear seats notwithstanding. Of more importance, though, is that it achieves some very impressive range and efficiency numbers.

Luxurious, comfortable, safe, swift and capable of carrying seven adults in comfort, this is a car that do pretty much anything you like without it breaking into a sweat.

The extra weight of the battery boosts driving comfort, though, while silent running even at motorway speeds means the Puma Gen-E is a relaxing cruiser. A 200-mile real-world range is roughly on a par with rivals, even though the Gen-E has a smaller battery, while there’s been no impact on interior space. That means the Puma is still a little cramped in the back, but the vast boot has been made even more useful with enlarged under-floor storage.

It’s packed full of equipment, has a roomy cabin and comes with a seriously impressive electric powertrain. It doesn’t quite have the driver-involvement to match its stonking straight-line pace and even with fancy adaptive air suspension, the ride felt a little fussy.

While the new cabin introduces fantastic quality and the in-car tech is class-leading, we’re left unconvinced by the drive.

Marrying such a charismatic engine to the rather tractor-like Defender might appear unnecessary, but it does go a long way towards making an already charming vehicle even more so. Be that as it may, the Classic V8 is fundamentally a rather primitive-feeling 4x4 that’s a chore to drive and incredibly expensive to buy and run, making it a no-go for the majority of buyers.

But for a performance SUV, the SQ5 isn’t particularly exciting to drive, and the interior quality could be better considering the more than £75,000 price tag, which is considerably higher than the BMW X3 M50’s, and puts it within spitting distance of the actually engaging Porsche Cayenne.",3.5,17900

As a result there are no bargains to be had, and that’s the way things are likely to stay, as fewer ICE cars are sold.

While cars such as the Volkswagen e-up! and Honda e have disappeared from their respective price lists, the 500e soldiers on against an influx of new rivals, including the similarly priced Renault 5 and Citroen e-C3.

A rather brash, somewhat juvenile character is the brand’s calling card and it has this in spades, plus there’s just enough performance to warrant its wacky styling. Considering it shares its platform and drivetrain with the more mature Alfa Romeo Junior Veloce, Abarth has done well to give the 600e its own flavour, with a harder-edged ride and more aggressive set-up.

A range of efficient powertrains, and the many strengths that you’d expect from Lexus – chiefly refinement and reliability – with others that are more of a surprise, such as keen driving dynamics and a competent infotainment system, entirely justify the NX’s spot among the class leaders.

It’s one of a number of van-derived MPVs that share common components, because it’s a product of Toyota’s joint venture with the Stellantis group to help fast-track the Japanese firm’s offerings in the commercial vehicle sector.",4.0,31985
283,Ford Tourneo Connect review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/ford/tourneo-connect,"Dean Gibson, Max Adams",2025-04-04,Auto Express,"While the Ford Tourneo Connect is a lightly rehashed Volkswagen Caddy, that’s not a bad thing in our eyes. It means it’s based on one of the best platforms in the business, so it can maintain Ford’s tradition of building cars that are entertaining to drive, regardless of the class that they’re in.",4.0,33940

There is no arguing with the sheer value on offer. This is a big, spacious car with a premium-feeling interior and an extensive equipment list, which includes all the essentials and lots of luxuries, for an appealing price. But as an EV, it’s little more than mediocre; the range is average at best, and the charging speeds are woeful.",3.0,36490

If haulage is still key for your needs, the larger and more efficient Mercedes E-Class might deliver the goods, but if not, the Audi’s near-shooting brake stance and luxurious cabin more than make up for it.

However we hope its effortless, wafting sensation isn’t lost by the engineers’ efforts to mimic the driving experience of established German cars, as we think this would be a much better selling point than the somewhat interesting, but rather pointless, manoeuvring capabilities or the design.",,17900

Its closest rival, the Ferrari 12Clindri, has a slightly more sophisticated chassis and a better gearbox, but the more muscular Vanquish suits the character of an Aston Martin perfectly. It still blends huge pace, sharp handling and glorious luxury, yet with a slight raw edge that adds an extra dose of excitement.

Reality stars aside, the reality here is the new electric Grandland is an attractive, spacious and well priced SUV that’s bound to sell well for the British brand. It may not be perfect or quite up with the best in class, but there’s certainly a reason why Vauxhall wanted its logo illuminated on the Grandland’s nose for all to see.",3.5,4808

302,Morgan Supersport review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/morgan/supersport,Alastair Crooks,2025-04-14,Auto Express,"For a Morgan, the Supersport has been restyled and reworked in a big way. Thankfully the characteristics you expect of a Morgan are alive and well - perhaps even more evident than ever before. The engine is still a peach and suits the Supersport brilliantly, the handling more focused than the old Plus Six, but the ride is agreeable and those couple of new practical touches are greatly appreciated. The Supersport might not have the everyday usability of other sports cars, though you could argue that simply makes it feel all the more special when the mood strikes to take it out.",4.5,16999

Yes, it’s added some weight over previous versions, but with that has come the added benefit of a useful electric range, thanks to its plug-in hybrid powertrain, and all the financial advantages that come with it.

The hard plastics and cheap-feeling trim are reflective of its lower price, but that may mean it stands up to the rigours of vanlife better than the more premium-feeling Volkswagen California.

Adding lowered suspension and big wheels just spoils the otherwise decent ride of the Wildtrak, but isn’t enough to turn it into a Raptor alternative.

In reality, it’s more of a trim level that happens to add more power rather than an out-and-out performance model, and given it's only slightly more expensive than the other options, it’s not completely pointless.

If you do mainly local or urban driving, the HR-V could be just what you’re looking for. It’s frugal, well equipped and reliable, plus its roomy cabin makes it great for carrying people, even if its boot is among the smallest in the class. We ran an HR-V on our long-term fleet and really liked it, but in group tests the Honda has been beaten by the Hyundai Kona and Renault Captur, which is why we’d consider a few alternatives alongside Honda’s offering.",,22975

In various group tests we’ve pitted the Cayenne against its biggest (in every sense of the word) rivals, including the Range Rover Sport, Audi Q8 and SQ8, along with the BMW X5, and it’s beaten all of them.

The latest entry-level powertrain is smooth, performs well and easy to live with every day, while in Match trim it offers all the kit that you really need.

332,Dacia Spring review,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/dacia/spring,Alex Ingram,2025-05-07,Auto Express,"On first impressions, the Dacia Spring makes a tempting case for itself, with its low price making it easier to overlook the flaws that often come with a car built down to a budget. However, delve a little deeper, and those shortcomings, chiefly the poor refinement and budget tyre choice, could make or break the Spring as a viable ownership proposition. We’d happily overlook past Euro NCAP safety ratings, because attempting to meet the safety organisation’s high standards would make the Spring prohibitively expensive, while great efficiency, ease of use and manoeuvrability mean it’s the perfect choice as a second car, especially if you’re doing plenty of urban journeys.",3.5,14985

Of course, it's nowhere near as ambitious as its bigger Nio-branded cousins, but it's also barely half the price. With Firefly, Nio could finally capture the imagination of hard-to-please Europeans.",,15600

We’ve not been sold on all of the brand’s EVs so far, but this is the German company’s most convincing yet. Ride, handling, range and tech are all excellent, while it manages to combine all of this with a strong powertrain, which provides punchy performance, rapid charging speeds and is efficient enough to return a long range at a cruise. Add in the fact that the Audi is also better value for money than the i5 M60, and it’s enough to seal the win on this occasion.",,21420

The combination of an estate car body and a powerful electric powertrain taps into a particular niche that Audi carved for itself with its petrol and diesel-engined cars; and with a long range and fast-charging capability, the A6 Avant e-tron delivers the kind of tech the company is also famous for.

The Mercedes-AMG E 53 Estate is probably the most subtle AMG model that Mercedes currently builds, especially in this practical estate guise.

This electric executive estate offers more space inside than its main rival, the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, while the quality of the fit and finish inside is excellent. The cabin is packed with tech, too, and limo-like refinement completes the package. However, it’s not quite as involving to drive as the Audi, which is something of a surprise when it comes to BMW, while the range falls short for a car that seems well suited to the brief of being a comfortable long-distance cruiser.",4.5,68375

It’s a car that’s as quick as a similarly priced Porsche Taycan Turbo in a straight line, yet more refined and no less sharp – more predictable, in fact – to drive. Add in a similarly sumptuous but more spacious cabin and incredible charging speeds, and it’s only efficiency where the Porsche has an edge. That aside, the Emeya is the better package. We’d still suggest that most buyers could save a lot of money and be as well served by the equally competent Emeya 600 models, though.",4.5,5615

A range of minor updates for the 2025 model year have boosted its refinement, tech and range, but none of the revisions come at the detriment of the overall package. While it looks like a sharply-styled hatchback, the Ioniq 5’s size means there’s excellent cabin space, and the design of the interior only helps to emphasise this.

But after three years, when you’re paying less than half price, things look more appealing – although lower prices don’t close the gap between the EQA and its more talented rivals. However, there’s a lot of badge appeal and the infotainment is deeply impressive, as are the digital displays. So far, reliability is good, kit is generous and refinement is excellent.

The obvious solution is to buy a range-extender, which can go for up to 400 miles at a time – but prices for these are much higher than for an electric MX-30, and that puts it up against some superb family cars that are simply better all-rounders.",,8990

It’s a bit ‘my first fast car’ in the way it goes about being rapid without any sort of edge or, to a large part, engagement. Everything works well, apart from the over-light steering, and it’s more comfortable than you’d expect – yet very capable on twisty roads and unbothered by wet or slippery surfaces. However, it lacks the soul or connection that great quick cars also offer.",4.0,17900

When we tested a Cayman S against an Audi TT RS Plus and a Lotus Evora S in 2013, the Porsche won on account of its sublime handling, sensible pricing and high-quality cabin.

It looks good, goes well, is beautifully made inside and out, and drives as sharply as any car of its type right now. It’s also spacious, and comes extremely well equipped – as indeed it should do for north of £70,000. But unless you specifically want the extra zing from its V6, and the precision of its ‘S5’ chassis, you might be better off waiting for the plug-in hybrid Audi A5 Avant due in the spring. It could be the pick of the range, but until then the S5 is the Avant to have if you want the do-it-all A5.",4.0,16749

In every case the BMW has come out on top, so it’s no wonder that it was our Executive Car of the Year in our 2017 New Car Awards – and then again in both subsequent years. Since then the Mercedes E-Class has stolen the BMW’s thunder, but don’t let that put you off, because the 5 Series is every bit as desirable as it has always been.",,13295

However, it’s taken a lot of car makers far too long to introduce hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs of their own, and arguably none can match the RAV4’s reliability, while it’s also better to drive than many of the electrified models in this segment.

At the time this brilliant roadster was held back by the badge on its nose, but nowadays things have changed radically, with the VX220 now extremely collectable. Sports cars like the VX220 have pretty much died out now, and under Stellantis it’s clear that Vauxhall will never make anything like this brilliant roadster, not least because of the focus on electric cars.

While the lower seating position means you don’t have as much forward visibility as in an SUV, the driving experience is better, thanks to a lower centre of gravity.

When we pitched a Formentor against a Peugeot 408, the Cupra came out on top, and it was the same when we put the top-spec model against the Alfa Romeo Stelvio in a three-way test that saw the Porsche Macan claiming first place – but not by as big a margin as you might think, because the Formentor really is that good.",,18697

But when we ran an EQC on our test fleet, it impressed with its refinement, luxury and hi-tech cabin, even if its efficiency left a bit to be desired, thanks to the car’s 2.5-tonne kerbweight. Expensive when new, the EQC is much more affordable as a used buy, due to the ravages of depreciation. Most car buyers are either pro-EV or anti-EV, with very few in between.

This is certainly a car that looks the part, but the Proceed’s beauty isn’t merely skin-deep. It’s enjoyable to drive, well made, well equipped and offers decent value for money, too.

Of course, the Panamera is expensive to run, and you could argue that it’s costly to buy, but in a world where the £40,000 Vauxhall Corsa exists, is this sleek five-door Porsche really that expensive?

As with many convertibles, it’s focused on styling flair more than extreme performance, and we can’t help feeling there’s more to come from the EV powertrain. So objectively it’s a hard vehicle to recommend – but much like its predecessors, we can see how it might appeal on charm alone.",3.5,17900

There are a lot more A-Class hatchbacks available than CLA saloons and Shooting Brakes, and given that the CLA isn’t as practical, you might find it hard to see the appeal. However, if ultimate practicality isn’t key, there’s lots to appreciate, including the sharp looks, the impressive cabin design and high quality, along with the efficient engines and transmissions. The only real downside is the tight rear seat space for adults, but if that’s not an issue, there isn’t any reason to avoid buying a CLA, whether that’s in saloon (coupé) or Shooting Brake form. Incidentally, if rear-seat headroom is an important consideration for you, buying the five-door CLA might just solve your problems, thanks to its higher roofline.",,17900

The i10 also isn’t an especially cheap model considering its size, yet Hyundai has struck a good compromise between compact external dimensions and generous cabin space, while it has also come up with a good balance between small-car prices and big-car equipment levels.

The Kia Niro pipped it into second place in a twin test, and when we pitted a Juke against the Vauxhall Mokka and Hyundai Kona, they both came out ahead of the Nissan.

But like early Teslas, a few small changes would elevate it from average to excellent. Fisker’s first effort looks great and drives well, plus it’s packed with unique features that separate it from key rivals. Yet we can’t help but feel it would’ve made more sense to focus on what buyers expect – quality, connectivity, and real-world range, for example – than filling it with features they don’t.

It’s fair to say the car maker hit the spot, because the car became a best seller as soon as it arrived. It was nominated as our Mid-Size SUV in our 2020 New Car Awards, and it came out on top against the Skoda Karoq and Toyota RAV4 in a group test in summer 2020. At the time we said: “The Ford Kuga is still the family SUV for keen drivers, because it handles brilliantly, but in Titanium spec it’s cheaper and better equipped than the Karoq – and nearly as versatile, despite slightly less passenger room”.

The result is keen prices and something for everyone; it also helps that at this time of year few people are thinking of buying a two-seat convertible, but don’t forget that spring is just around the corner… Even really nice Z3s aren’t worth a lot, so there’s no point buying anything ropey because it’ll almost certainly prove to be a false economy. The stylish Z3 provides top-down fun, yet it’s user-friendly. Running and purchase costs are sensible, but there’s plenty of performance for everyday use.

But it’s not as big inside as its vast dimensions suggest, and the ride quality can be caught out by urban road scars – annoying for a vehicle designed for gliding up to events, rather than crossing continents. Still, there’s enough here of what a Rolls-Royce should be – and anything approaching what you’d call an obvious rival for this car, from Bentley or Range Rover, is still at least a year away.",4.5,7000

Unsurprisingly, the Touareg Mk3 is the most impressive iteration yet, but it's up against some very impressive contenders in the marketplace, most of which carry more prestigious badges. If you're not too worried about having the poshest badge possible, the Touareg could be just what you're looking for with its powerful engines, luxurious and roomy cabin, excellent towing abilities and generous equipment levels. Admittedly, its rivals also offer most of these things, but the VW isn't too flash and it's better value than some of those alternatives, even if you'll still need deep pockets to buy and run one.",,12995

When the Hyundai i20 was updated in 2023, the changes weren’t of any great significance, so there’s no point stretching yourself financially for a newer car when the pre-facelift version is so capable. However, some of the i20’s rivals are also worth a closer look, because there’s a lot of talent in this segment; the Clio in particular is a very capable all-rounder. If you’re after an exciting drive, then the i20 N is pretty much unassailable, having taken on and beaten the Ford Fiesta ST as well as the VW Polo GTI in a group test in 2022.

Despite this, we’d suggest you try some of the 2008’s key rivals before signing on the dotted line – with its cousins the Citroen C3 Aircross and Jeep Renegade particular favourites of ours, along with the SEAT Arona. Having said this, though, there’s still lots to like about the stylish Peugeot.",,16599

It’s impractical, true, and it looks expensive on paper.

When we pitched an Ignis against the Renault Twingo, the Suzuki won thanks to its value and performance. We ran an Ignis for 10 months on our test fleet and it soon won us over with its cleverly packaged cabin, manoeuvrability and fuel-sipping engine.

But there are plenty of other reasons to buy a Mondeo, including the roomy cabin, big boot capacity, generous equipment levels and affordable pricing.

We ran one on our long-term test fleet in 2020, and it proved to be a great car for a family of three, including a small child. The high purchase costs might put you off, and so could the fact that on the used market, the model range is very narrow; you’ll almost certainly have to settle for a 1.0 TSI petrol engine.

With the incredibly talented and desirable BMW 535d costing £25,000 less, at £38,900, you can see why our roads are not awash with Gran Coupés. It was that pricing which led to the BMW being beaten by the Mercedes CLS in our triple test in 2012, but the Gran Coupé did knock the Porsche Panamera into third place, while the M6 edition of the Gran Coupé trounced the Audi RS7 Sportback when we brought them together in 2014.

We like the A110 so much that it was our Coupé of the Year in 2019, 2020 and again in 2021.

The new infotainment system is one of the best in its class, while the improved PHEV system will make the GLA 250 e more appealing to company car users.

The product is competitive on quality, design and technology. Some of that tech feels gimmicky, some of the safety systems are a tad intrusive and, despite the cruising comfort and prodigious pace, the driving experience is undermined by the bouncy ride, but generally, the 001 is very convincing. That Zeekr sells this roomy, rapid, electric hatch at prices that seriously undercut the competition should be focusing minds in boardrooms across Europe.",3.5,15600

This is still one of the sharper-handling cars in the class and in this base form at least, there is a slight trade-off between that agility and outright comfort.

We loved the car’s ability to transport seven people in comfort, its sensible purchase price and running costs, and its generous equipment.

So there was everything to play for with the Puma, which immediately went on to claim plaudits galore across the industry, and it also became Ford’s most popular car in the UK. In standard form the Puma is great to drive, practical and good value; choose the ST and you’ll have something that’s far more than the sum of its parts. When we ran a Puma ST-Line for a year and 30,000 miles, we came away impressed by the breadth of its talents, and if you buy one you’re likely to be just as impressed.",,16270

It can cost almost as much to make a small vehicle as a big one, so you have to charge lots to sell a small car, and more if it’s an EV. Make it a hi-tech premium model and you have a triple whammy. But electric city cars can be desirable if you can afford the high asking prices. When we ran an e for eight months in 2020/21, we loved its efficiency, manoeuvrability and comfort. However, the thing that made it easier to live with was having another car available for the longer journeys, especially in the winter.

Is it a family hatch or an MPV? The simple answer is that it features elements of both, and it’s no less desirable because of this; if you want a high-quality hatch that offers an extra dose of usability, thanks to its roomier-than-average cabin, look no further. Think of it as a high-roof A-Class.

Whether you’re buying for regular road use, track- day fun or as a collector’s piece, the car won’t disappoint if you do your homework.

A world away from traditional global top-sellers such as the Citroen 2CV, BMC Mini and VW Beetle, with its hi-tech engineering, supercar performance and relatively luxurious cabin, the Model 3 is impressive in many ways. As our Driver Power surveys show, owners generally rate their Teslas very highly, but the build quality and reliability often leave something to be desired.

These MGs have a reputation for poor reliability, but most of that comes from the engine’s readiness to blow gaskets. This is a weak spot that can now be overcome, though, with many engines having already been overhauled for greater durability. Crucially, the F and TF handle well, have a free-revving engine and both offer tremendous fun for the money. If you’re craving cheap thrills this summer, then look no further than the MG.",,15600

But whether this five-seat Outbound model is the car for you will depend on how you plan to use it; if you need seven or eight seats even occasionally, then the slightly smaller boot of the existing HSE won’t be a dealbreaker. The 130 is a hugely practical family car, whichever way you look at it.",4.0,3946

The handling gains aren’t sufficient to outweigh the notable trade-off in every day comfort; the car’s ride is just too firm for the majority of UK roads. There are few faults elsewhere, however – those cross-shopping from premium German makers will find plenty to really like about Polestar’s updated EV.",3.5,2000

But this GR Sport version is probably the weakest of the breed, despite having the more potent of the powertrains. You’re paying a lot here for some styling add-ons and some extra power that might make the car more comfortable at speed, but does not add any greater involvement. We’d happily recommend the C-HR in general – but the sweet spot of the range is to be found elsewhere.",3.5,15600

It’s rare and expensive, but if a BMW M5 feels a little too hardcore and looks too flashy, then this is a compelling alternative.",4.0,7000
1066,New Aston Martin DB12 review: almost as good to drive as to look at,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/aston-martin/db12,Steve Fowler,2023-12-21,Auto Express,"The DB12 is a great advert for Aston Martin under its latest ownership and management team, but it’s not quite perfect. It’s a seriously impressive driver’s car, with a huge range of abilities that belie the car’s size and layout – as a ‘Super GT’ it ticks the ‘Super’ box good and proper. But with hotter DB12s likely to follow – an AMR version is surely on the cards – we’d rather it be a bit more ‘GT’ and a little less ‘Super’. As is, we found the tyre noise especially tiring, and we’d rather a slightly more supple ride too. Some of the tech still feels a generation behind, as well. But then, for £185k, you will have what is officially the most beautiful car in the world.",4.0,12600

The result is a car that’s really good to drive, smooth, refined and decently frugal too. In group tests we’ve pitted the CX-30 against the VW T-Roc, Citroen C4 and Kia Xceed, and it’s beaten them. But against the Skoda Karoq, the Mazda came second. In a hugely competitive sector, the engine, transmission and trim level you pick, along with your precise requirements, will make all the difference as to whether the CX-30, or one of its rivals, is best for you. So try plenty of options before choosing.",,16050

It was the sixth time that a Peugeot had scooped this top honour, and while this prize is never a guarantee of commercial success (or that the car really is truly great), the 208 went on to be a best-seller across Europe, and deservedly so. As well as looking distinctive, the model is well equipped and good to drive, even if it’s no class leader in this respect. Where the 208 really scores as a used buy is with the number of cars available and the breadth of the range; there’s a good selection of power sources and trim levels. There’s no choice of bodystyles, though, because all 208s come with five doors. This shouldn’t be a problem, however, with few buyers wanting a three-door supermini nowadays.",,11997

However, despite Vauxhall’s best attempts to boost the EV’s financial appeal, it’s still expensive – not only against a new influx of Chinese rivals that weren’t available when the first Corsa Electric came out, but many established European alternatives, too.
