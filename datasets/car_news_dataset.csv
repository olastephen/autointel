1,Porsche buyers prefer engines. Who knew?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/porsche/porsche-buyers-prefer-engines/,Georg Kacher,2025-07-01,Car Magazine UK,"After 30 golden years Porsche suddenly finds itself at a busy crossroads littered with massive challenges. At the heart of the problem is relatively poor sales for electric Porsches, prompting a rethink of the current strategy of switching to an all-electric line-up. Sales in China sales were down 30 per cent in 2024, the return on investment is veering away from the targeted 20 per cent, and the are performing below target, with resale values plummeting, and the group’s all-important electric-only SSP architecture is already three years late. While the state-funded Chinese car industry is harvesting the CO2 fields with a glut of affordable and competent battery-powered products supported by a fleet of equally impressive long-range hybrids, European high-flyers like Porsche are not only struggling to convince their predominantly conservative fan base with electric products – they are simultaneously facing fundamental productivity, cost, technology and infrastructure issues. On 10 November CFO Lutz Meschke stated in an investors’ call that Porsche would have to rethink its EV-centric strategy. Options would include new editions of existing combustion-engine platforms, and making sure future electric models can accommodate combustion and hybrid powerplants. ‘What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer,’ said Meschke, without providing further details. Key to the rethink is the Macan Mk2, recently launched in electric-only guise. A combustion version – presumably sharing underpinnings with the – would most likely take three years to develop, meaning a long absence from the market of one of Porsche’s biggest sellers. An announcement is expected in March. As recently as October, Porsche was still planning a heavily EV-dominated future product line-up that included the , revealed as a concept in 2023, the K1 seven-seat SUV, an electric Panamera, and electric as well as combustion Cayennes. How much of that plan remains is unclear, but we hear the 1500bhp Mission X is doomed and the K1 faces a long delay if not complete cancellation. The knock-on effects of the latter would be felt throughout the group, as the underlying SSP61 components set is earmarked for future Lamborghini and Bentley products. Backing EV so vigorously is now looking like a mistake. Instead of hedging his bets, BMW-style, the Porsche CEO Oliver Blume went all-in with the initially very successful, and he waived the fallback plans for the best-selling petrol-fed Macan and the Boxster/Cayman. Despite persistent software and battery issues, the Boxster and Cayman are finally heading for pre- production. That’s the good news. The bad news concern the ho-hum max charging power of 270kW, the corresponding extended charging times and most of all the rumoured highly ambitious pricing with numbers of between 130,000 and 150,000 euros. Only five years ago, Porsche had envisioned a peak annual volume of 331,631 units for 2025. At the most recent investors’ conference call, however, Meschke reckoned a mid-term maximum of 250,000 sales to be more realistic. But even this number won’t come easy now that some projects might bite the dust while others will be subject to unforeseen lifecycle extensions which are bound to harm their appeal. One of the world's leading motoring journalists, Georg has been a staple on CAR magazine for six decades. Incredible, but true. This extraordinary experience means that Georg has probably scooped it, driven it and rated it before anybody else!"
2,Renault 4 E-Tech UK pricing: strong value for your money,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/4-ev/,Phil McNamara,2025-05-28,Car Magazine UK,"The new is another electric car that looks to La Regie’s back catalogue for inspiration – while simultaneously squaring up to the future. Like the , with which it shares two-thirds of its components, it wraps the hardware of a modish EV in a decidedly retro-inspired wardrobe. And now we know it will be priced from £26,995 when order books open in July 2025. Curiously, there is a staggered buying process. If you’re prepared to fork out £150 for an ‘R Pass’ you’ll be able to place your Renault 4 order on 1 July. Not quite that desperate to get your mitts on one? Then the ‘general public’ will be allowed to start their purchasing journey on 15 July. £150 to jump the queue by two weeks? Seems a bit ‘dynamic pricing’ cynical at first, but there are other benefits. R Pass customers also get exclusive access to three years’ free servicing – if they use Renault’s Mobilize Financial Services (MFS) to fund the car. Perhaps more importantly, the latest announcement confirms the three standard trim levels for the UK: Evolution, Techno and Iconic. The optional ‘plein sud’ canvas electric roof for the two higher specifications won’t be available straight away, however. All models at UK launch get the 148bhp electric drive system with what Renault’s calling the ‘comfort’ driving range. Prices start at £26,995 for the Evolution, with the Techno £2k more at £28,995 and the Iconic £2k more than that at £30,995. For the kit and spec it’s not a bad-looking deal; a Fiat Grande Panda Electric is considerably cheaper at £20,975, while the Hyundai Inster is more spacious for people from £23,505, but these have just 111bhp and 113bhp, respectively. Standard equipment is generous throughout the Renault 4’s line-up. Highlights for the entry-level Evolution include 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry, heated windscreen washer nozzles, dual-zone climate control, 10.0-inch infotainment screen, cruise control, reversing camera and lots of safety gear. Upgrade to Techno and the infotainment gets Google Maps built in, there’s a wireless phone charger, adaptive cruise control, choice of driving modes, front and side parking sensors (in addition to the standard rear ones), ambient lighting, four-levels of regen via wheel-mounted paddles, roof rails and vehicle-to-load bidirectional charging. Iconic adds an electric, hands-free boot opening system, height-adjustable front seats (with six-way lumbar adjustment for the driver), and more safety kit, including blindspot monitors and extra adaptive driver assistance. More significantly, it’s the only version that comes with heated front seats and steering wheel, items you can’t add as options to the lesser specifications. Unveiled at the 2024 , the Renault 4 plays its historic connections less flamboyantly than the 5; that car indulges its lineage more obviously, perhaps, but if you know your twentieth century Renaults you’ll clock the connections to the famous Four in this boxier, more practically-minded hatchback. There’s the distinctive R4 front grille, reinterpreted in a single-piece snout encompassing an illuminated diamond badge, distinctive light graphics and a light bar that echoes the shape of the original Renault 4 facia. Claimed to be ‘the world’s first one-piece illuminated grille,’ it stretches 1.45m across and illuminations are standard from second-run Techno trim and above. Other links to the original include the kicked-up C-pillar and side window graphic, the ribbed lower door design and the angle of the rear tailgate, which now extends much lower than on conventional hatchbacks for an admirably low boot floor. These things matter if you’re a dog owner or regularly lug heavy sports equipment into the car. ‘We didn’t want to betray the spirit of the original Renault 4,’ Renault’s vice president of design, Gilles Vidal, told CAR. ‘The Renault 4EVER Trophy show car [above] was the rally-raid version – this is the urban iteration of that. It’s super-practical and we wanted to make sure it could swallow Ikea Billy bookcases but still look cool.’ The new 4 rides on the Renault Group’s AmpR Small architecture, shared with the 5 and upcoming electric Nissan Micra, bringing front-wheel drive and fully independent rear suspension (quite unusual in this class). It will be available with two different battery sizes and motors, largely mirroring the tech found on the latest 5: Both models can be fast-charged, although at relatively modest speeds. The smaller battery can take onboard DC current at up to 80kW, whereas the 110kW model can charge at up to 100kW – fast enough that either model can replenish their batteries from 15-80% in 30 minutes, according to Renault. A heat pump is standard on every model to aid optimised range and charging in all temperatures. The company’s battery tech is advancing apace; engineers say the entire battery now weighs less than 300kg and a new way of packaging four large modules in one battery casing saves around 20 kilos compared with a . The smaller battery simply leaves one of the compartments empty. Bi-directional charging is offered on the new Renault 4 E-Tech. That means you can power electric items such as airbed compressors or a kettle when you’re out in the field – or equally sign up to an energy deal which lets you manage power around your home, shuffling energy from batteries, solar panels and the grid to achieve the greenest, cheapest combination. The original Renault 4 sold 8.1 million units between 1961-1992, making it one of the most successful cars of its period. Dubbed Quattrelle, after its domestic 4L badge, the boxy silhouette freed up space for people and luggage galore – a trait the designers of the new car have strived to repeat. It’s only supermini sized, at 4.1m long, 1.8m wide and 1.6m high but some clever packaging has freed up a roomy boot with a 420-litre capacity (including the split underfloor cubby). That’s 100 litres over the smaller 5 hatch. The designers recreated the flat tailgate while the engineers reworked the cross beam on the rear sub-frame to allow a dramatically lower boot floor that’s 10cm lower than any rival. We’ve sat in the boot of the new 2025 Renault 4 and can vouch that the loadbay is significantly lower than any rival we’ve seen: the loading height is a remarkable 60.7cm from the tarmac. The interior is almost a carbon copy of the 5’s, but with a few distinct touches for more family-focused duty. The rear floor is entirely flat, freeing more room for passengers’ feet, while the Techno spec comes with trim inspired by denim for a hard-working, blue-jeans vibe. This kind of modish charm percolates the 4, with customisable stickers, two-tone roof and steel wheels all available on the extensive options list. Renault knows it can coin extra margin by offering cool extras these days, especially on a car with a fashionable brief. Other toys available on the options list include a 1m canvas rollback roof made by Webasto which opens by voice command, a baguette holder (initially available only on launch-spec models at a high price, but with a planned roll-out across the board at lower cost) and interchangeable indicator stalks, whose sleeve can be unclicked and swapped with ease. In fact, Renault claims 670 possible combinations of colour, trims and wheels, making it easy for you to stand out from the crowd. Special mention to the new deliciously retro Hauts-de-France Green of the car in our pictures, a tribute to the Île-de-France Blue of the 1960s. That with steel wheels sounds … The cabin of the Renault 4 E-Tech is modish and on trend. Pleasingly, there are enough physical switches so that not everything is operated by a sub-menu on the standard 10in touchscreen. It’s roomy in the front and the quilted headlining is a lovely touch overhead. Pick your spec carefully, as the character of the car is changed significantly with the denim upholstery option (which extends to the dashboard) and other fabrics. Leather is not available on any model – in line with its sustainable principles: 89% of the R4 can be recycled and around a quarter of its materials are from the circular economy. CAR has pored all over the newcomer at its Paris show debut and the rear seats are disappointingly tight on space; there is only so much magic they can weave on a car whose footprint extends to just 4.1m long. The 4 and 5 duo have a similar relationship to the Clio/Captur – the 4 is not meant as a fully fledged family car, more a compact crossover vibe to challenge the . Sitting behind a 6ft adult means less rear legroom and the space for feet is particularly pinched under the front seats. A clever touch on left-hand drive models is a fully folding front passenger seat which can be cranked forwards to lie pretty flat – so you can carry a surfboard or other bulky item up to 2.2m in length. Disappointingly, this has not been engineered for right-hand drive, denying Brits this feature. The most basic Renault 4 E-Tech with the smaller battery weighs from 1410kg – an encouraging sign for an electric car. The company has not yet released full performance figures, but claims the more powerful model can sprint from 0-62mph in less than 8.5 seconds, with 50-75mph in less than 7.0sec. Top speed is pegged to 93mph. Launched in 1961, the Renault 4 – or ‘Quatrelle’ as it was known in France, owing to its 4L badge – was the world’s first mass-produced hatchback. That made it a good load-carrier, especially with deckchair seats that could be removed. With long-travel independent suspension and front-wheel drive, the 4L proved adept at scrambling over tough terrain, making it the darling of rural France. Even some of us at CAR had a soft spot for the model – ran deep. With contributions from"
3,New Yugo: scale model of next-gen low-cost supermini revealed at Car Design Event 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/new-yugo/,Jake Groves,2025-05-06,Car Magazine UK,"Yugo is making a valiant return! This is our first tangible look at the all-new, value-focused supermini that’s being created from the ground up: a scale model of the new car at Car Design Event 2025. We first caught wind of Yugo making a comeback after sketches by Serbian designer Darko Marčeta were made public and the naming rights to Yugo were secured by Prof. Dr. Aleksandar Bjelić – a university professor that has links with to automotive industry in Germany. If you’re unfamiliar (or under the age of 25), the Yugo was a small supermini built by Zastava at a factory in former Yugoslavia. Its factory is in what’s now Serbia, and the Yugo was a car that was heavily derived from the Fiat 127 and 128. It was, to put it politely, a car that wasn’t looked on very kindly by the Western world, with the Yugo regularly making lists of the worst cars ever made – usually down to its sub-par handling, weedy performance and rubbish build quality. Even so, it found a cult following around the world, with admirers including CAR’s own European Editor and font of automotive knowledge Georg Kacher, who took one he owns on . At Car Design Event 2025, Bjelić unveiled a scale model of the car he and his team intend to put forward for production. The model shows off very similar design cues initially seen in the sketches; a small, relatively boxy supermini that distinctly features only two doors. In a statement, the Yugo team say the reason for keeping its new car a two-door ‘does not just serve as a historical reminiscence, but underscores the affordability and the sportiness of the new model.’ Yugo has confirmed that the new supermini will launch as a combustion engine car, working on both naturally-aspirated and turbocharged versions, as well as manual and automatic versions. Yugo says that an electric version is possible, as are different body styles. And, to cover that point about sportiness, Yugo has hinted that more details on a performance derivative of the new supermini will be covered in detail in September 2025. Given it’s a car that’ll wear the Yugo name, the aim is for it to be cheap. Yugo is reportedly looking to secure ‘an established platform from a co-operation partner.’ Yugo says that, after its scale model reveal at Car Design Event 2025, it intends to create a fully functional prototype at the 2027 Belgrade Expo.

4,BYD goes lux: the Denza Z9 GT is a 952bhp problem for the German premium brands,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/denza/z9-gt/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-09,Car Magazine UK,"► Meet Denza, the latest Chinese brand looking to crack the European market. Founded in 2010 by Daimler and BYD, in 2021 Denza repositioned itself as a premium brand that marries technology and elegance. It sits above BYD’s volume-focused range, but below its ultra-luxurious . This year it’s coming to Europe, with the UK entry planned for 2026. Launching in Milan during the city’s annual Design Week, Denza is starting things off with the Z9 GT – a 952bhp or 858bhp shooting brake available with electric or hybrid powertrains. There are already several models in the brand’s Chinese range, but just two are confirmed for the EU for now; the Z9 GT and D9 MPV. However, CAR understands the range could swell to six or seven models – and even include some from both the Yangwang and Fangchengbao marques. ‘The Denza brand has European influence at its heart, and we are confident that buyers will find distinctive, unique appeal in the car’s mix of sophisticated, elegant design, strong performance and astounding technology,’ said executive vice president of BYD, Stella Li.  ‘This model is a defining example of what Denza strives to achieve; this makes it the perfect choice to lead Denza into Europe.’ Any why not an SUV? Because ‘the Z9 GT is a good model to represent BYD technology, represent the design and all the unique technology we have for Denza brand,’ she added. Two cars have been confirmed for the European market so far; the Z9 GT and then the D9 MPV, which will be a direct competitor to Xpeng’s X9 MPV when it arrives. Li told CAR the range will then grow to six or seven cars in total, including Fangchengbao off-road models. And we’ll get it out the way: the name is acronym for the brand’s key values: diverse, elegance, novel, zenith and aspirational. Denza won’t confirm which car of the two will come first, but the smart money’s on the Z9 GT you see here. Denza’s first model in Europe will be the Z9 GT, a handsome shooting brake penned by ex-Alfa, Lamborghini and Seat designer Wolfgang Eggers. Ask Eggers, and he’ll tell you the design of the Z9 GT was inspired largely by flying silk: ‘Take a sculpture, or a vehicle like the Denza Z9 GT, and cover it in silk,’ he said at the car’s launch. ‘Then take the same item and cover it with cotton, and you will see something very different. The silk falls naturally and covers the body but still shows, under the surface, the beauty of what is already there.’ Look at the car for yourself and you’ll see some heavy inspiration from Stuttgart, no surprise as the Z9’s styling and proportions use the Porsche Panamera as a reference. It seems to get more interesting as it goes on: you get an inoffensive BYD-face at the front, then Taycan-style sculpting on the sides. Finally, the car ends with a chunky pair of rear lights that are more American muscle-car than Chinese new-energy vehicle. It’s about ten times more interesting than something like the BYD Atto 2. On paper, the proportions shout Panamera, but this car feels higher (due to its hybrid or electric powertrain) and more bulbous than the Porsche. BYD is hoping the Z9 GT’s more European looks will appeal to a European audience, and in person they might be right. Interestingly, the Z9 is also available as a sedan in another markets. It arguably looks even better, but sadly there are no plans to bring that to Europe right now. The Z9 GT will be available in hybrid and full-electric. The BEV will use Denza’s e3 platform, which benefits from vehicle motion control (ESC), rear-wheel-dual motor independent steering, and cell-to-body tech for better battery integration. Denza believes these three technologies combine to push the Z9 ahead of the competition: cell-to-body makes the car 32 per cent stiffer, while the rear-steering setup means the car can swing itself into gaps, or crabwalk into tight marking spaces. It’s all backed up by strong performance: the BEV 0-62mph takes 3.4 seconds, thanks to a 101kWh battery, 308bhp front motor and a pair of 322bhp rear motors (Chinese specs). That’s 952bhp in total, with a CLTC range of 391 miles. CAR understands that’ll translate to something like 310 to 340 miles WLTP and a little less power, as engineers trade some speed for more palatable range for EU customers. When it’s time to charge an 800-volt system should speed things up. The plug-in gets the same CTB tech and trick steering but swaps the motors for a 2.0-litre turbo. and 38.5kWh battery. The stats are nearly as impressive; the engine itself makes 268bhp and 232ft lbs of torque and it’s combined with two 295bhp rear motors (Chinese specs again). The hybrid uses its combined 858bhp of power for 0-62mph in 3.6 seconds. As in the Seal U, the Z9 GT’s DM i hybrid system is able to act like a range extender at speeds below 62mph, and then more like a hybrid car using both the engine and motors at speeds over that. Inside, the Z9 GT is as techy as you’d expect from a more premium version of BYD. Front and centre is a huge 17.3-inch touchscreen, flanked by two further 13.2-inch screens both for the driver and passenger. But despite the screen real estate, Denza’s designers have still managed to pack in an array of switches. Cut like crystal, they’re all over the cabin – from the windows to the centre console – and they give the car an old school, premium feel. Combine that with ambient lighting and a 20-speaker system from French hi-fi brand Devialet, and the Z9 may actually back up its luxurious promises. Denza will face stiff competition from legacy brands – but a seemingly strong product alongside lessons learned from BYD’s rollout mean it’s in a better position to succeed than most. ‘We wanted to prepare ourselves, our staff and resources to be ready,’ Li said of the launch’s timing, and there are already key areas outside of the product Denza wants to nail. ‘We also need to pay extreme attention to the after sales service,’ Li told us. ‘We bring a very technologically [advanced] model, but then we build up very strong after-sales service,’ she added. ‘Then this gives people’s confidence. BYD is a long-term player, and we will always be here, to service them anytime, waiting for them.’ ‘When we launch into Denza, that’s more about premium,’ she explained. ‘It’s very important, not only tell the story, but also to pay attention to the details – and the service we’ll do much better too.’ To that end, Denza will land in Europe as a very separate entity to its parent brand: it’ll be sold in a separate network to BYD, with Li confirming that the brand will benefit from its own bespoke dealers, marketing and sales teams. As for the product? Li is even more confident about that: ‘I think to sell BYD cars is simple. Just bring all the competition cars in the test track,’ Li told CAR, ‘because this car is really ten times better than the competition. We have a lot of unique features the other legacy brands do not have.’ Whether the Z9 GT is a cohesive package remains to be seen, but we’ll find out when we drive it. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
5,Lewis Hamilton’s Ferrari era begins: can he win it with Maranello?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ferrari/can-lewis-win-at-maranello/,Damien Smith,2025-03-13,Car Magazine UK,"When Ferrari’s new SF-25 Formula 1 car hit the track for the first time at Fiorano in February, a clip went viral of a tifosi cutting down a tree because it was spoiling his view. You don’t get that at Silverstone. As Lewis Hamilton has surely discovered by now, nothing about driving for Ferrari is quite the same – or, for that matter, as sane – as life at other F1 teams. It’s clear he felt the full power of that old red magic from the moment he rolled out of the Shell garage for his first Ferrari run back in January. The tifosi had gathered en masse for that occasion too, just as they always used to on such days – just as they always will. ‘I’ve been lucky enough to have many firsts in my career, from the first test to the first race, podium, win and championship, so I wasn’t sure how many more I would have,’ said Hamilton afterwards. ‘But driving a Ferrari for the first time this morning was one of the best feelings of my life.’ He’s savoured what’s surely the ultimate for any racing driver: the honeymoon period of becoming an F1 driver for the most illustrious car maker in the world. But as that initial buzz wears off, what will be the reality of Hamilton’s stint at Ferrari? What’s he in for, and how will he handle it on the days when the sparkle goes missing? ‘I used to say driving for Ferrari is nearly as good as winning a world championship,’ says Jody Scheckter, the South African who achieved in 1979 what Hamilton would love to pull off in 2025: winning a title for Ferrari at the first time of asking. Jody was 29 when he joined Ferrari back then. Hamilton is attempting the same at 40. ‘Working for Ferrari is so unbelievable,’ says Joan Villadelprat, a Spaniard who for three years at the end of the 1980s became the F1 team’s first non-Italian chief mechanic. ‘For example, Ferrari has owners’ clubs all round the world. Every race I went to I had to go to dinners with these clubs, in Montreal, Adelaide, wherever we went. Without doubt it is different to any other team. It now works more like an English team, the way of approaching the work at the circuit. But the consequence of working at Ferrari is unique. Nothing compares.’ Hamilton will have so much coming at him in months to come – not least the challenge of dealing with a young, fast team-mate. Scheckter knows all about that. In the early months of his first season Gilles Villeneuve blew him away. The odds of an echo in 2025 via Charles Leclerc, 13 years Hamilton’s junior and considered by many the fastest of the current generation over one lap, are short. ‘It makes you pull out another level,’ Jody recalls. ‘Gilles won the first two races [actually, the third and fourth of 1979. Jacques Laffite won the first two, for Ligier] and I was the number one driver in contract. In reality he was becoming number one. So I just had to knuckle down and do better, which I did. It took everything – and more.’ Scheckter won back-to-back at Zolder and Monaco to take the points lead, scored consistently through the summer and clinched the title with two rounds to spare, leading Villeneuve to a Ferrari 1-2 at Monza. Hamilton can only dream. Seven Ferrari F1 drivers have managed to win in their first race for the team, one of them being Nigel Mansell who took the most unlikely of victories, 10 years after Scheckter’s title, in Rio in 1989. Villadelprat was Mansell’s chief mechanic that day. He recalls Mansell’s doubts about John Barnard’s stunning but revolutionary Ferrari 640, the first F1 car driven through a semi-automatic gearbox, with steering wheel paddles for the changes – sensational then, common today on road cars. ‘It was the best car ever designed by John Barnard,’ says Villadelprat. ‘But in testing it was not reliable. Anyway, Mansell arrived. He was an old-fashioned man: “Where’s the gearlever? I don’t want to drive like that.” He drove at Fiorano – and after 10 laps he said “This is brilliant!”’ In Rio, Mansell was so sure his Ferrari debut wouldn’t last long he tried to book an early flight home via a British Airways captain he met on the grid… Yet less than two hours later, there he was, taking the chequered flag ahead of Alain Prost’s McLaren. Villadelprat drew blood to get that svelte 640 across the line. ‘Mid-race we had a radio call from Mansell: “The steering is gone, the steering wheel is moving!” he says. “Okay, come in, come in. John Barnard and myself, we decided to change the steering wheel. John took the old wheel, I put the new one on, pushed it with my hand and Mansell went out and won the race. When he left the pitlane I felt wetness in my glove: the radio switch was caught in my skin. I hadn’t even felt it.’ Hamilton is less likely than drivers of previous generations to face the chaos of Ferrari’s infamous internal politics. He signed largely because of Frédéric Vasseur, who for the past two years has brought a calm authority back to Ferrari in a manner last seen during the Michael Schumacher era, when Jean Todt and Ross Brawn protected the F1 team from the caustic friction that traditionally undermines life at Maranello. Vasseur is an old friend who ran Hamilton in Formula 3 and GP2, and their iron-clad relationship will be crucial if the seven-time champion is to thrive at Ferrari. It certainly wasn’t calm during Villadelprat’s spell in Italy, which coincided with Enzo Ferrari’s death in August 1988. Enzo used to call him Capitano, he says. These were turbulent times, amid a power struggle involving Ferrari’s son, then known as Piero Lardi, and executives from Fiat as the car manufacturer’s control increased over the jewel it had owned a stake in since 1969. ‘For Lewis, the politics is less now because you only have one boss – Vasseur,’ points out Villadelprat. ‘But now the politics has moved: it will be between the drivers, and Leclerc is very political. He’s well integrated inside Ferrari and it puts him in a very strong position. He speaks Italian perfectly too.’ The language barrier is a moot point. Hamilton has openly admitted he doesn’t speak the lingo, but then again, neither does Vasseur. Neither did Scheckter, for that matter – and he still doesn’t, even though officially he’s an Italian resident today. ‘Old Man Ferrari loved Gilles; he spoke the language, and I didn’t,’ says Scheckter. ‘But I never felt out of it. I had Brenda Vernor’ – Enzo’s British-born private secretary and a key figure in Ferrari folklore. ‘After every practice and race I’d write my comments to Brenda and she would then give them to Old Man Ferrari. I always felt good being there.’ Villadelprat comments: ‘I hope he learns Italian, but doesn’t read the press.’ Ah, the Italian media: the viper whose bite remains as venomous as it ever was. ‘Talk to your mechanics, get integrated with the team and say something to the public when you do a press release – but don’t talk to the press,’ advises Joan. ‘Don’t even look at them!’ Scheckter chuckles about his relationship with journalists and takes some pride in his status as a three-time consecutive winner of the ‘lemon prize’ – for being the most difficult F1 driver to deal with. ‘At least I went to fetch my prize, so it wasn’t too bad,’ he says with a smile. ‘I always said to everybody in the team, “Let’s stick together; don’t listen to the stuff that they write.” I think guys before me worried more. People like [Carlos] Reutemann. But we stuck together and it didn’t really bother me what they said.’ Then again, imagine outspoken Scheckter in F1 today, with social media waiting to pour scorn and castigation. It would probably be unfair to say Hamilton faces more pressure than his predecessors, but the nature of modern communication and the toxicity in tone – direct from the public more than the media – is harder to insulate against. Then again, Hamilton has been F1’s most famous driver since 2007. ‘For me, I always kept the mania in perspective,’ says Scheckter. ‘When people were jumping at me for an autograph, I knew the next year they’d be stamping on my body going to the next guy. Lewis is so popular now he’s on a different planet.’ So predictions: how will Hamilton fare at Ferrari? ‘George Russell outperformed him at Mercedes last year,’ says Scheckter. ‘You can’t stay good for the rest of your life. Lewis has been fantastic, probably the best of all time. Schumacher had the same result [in terms of world championships], but he tended to be dirty in his racing. Lewis has always raced clean. But at 40? People are different. I got bored and retired early, then changed careers. Lewis still seems to be enthusiastic and is in a good place personally, although that isn’t always good for performance.’ Villadelprat is more emphatic. ‘If the car is good Hamilton will beat Leclerc and win the championship,’ he states. ‘If the car is not so good Leclerc will beat Hamilton. Simple. Hamilton has got too many things in life to think about, has a lot of money, has seven championships, so he’s not going to risk his life to gain one more position. I saw it in all the F1 champions I knew: when the car is good you see the real driver.’ CAR contributor on motor sport-related subjects.

6,Seat: now is not the right time to introduce an electric car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/seat/electric-car-plans-delayed/,Ted Welford,2025-03-13,Car Magazine UK,"Seat will continue to focus on combustion cars until at least the end of the decade, and now is not the right time to launch an according to the firm’s boss. Speaking at Seat and Cupra’s annual conference, Wayne Griffiths was cautious about the current rate of electrification growth amid buyer hesitancy and a lack of support from governments. As a result, plans to electrify Seat are on hold and ‘not a priority’ as the brand’s long-term future remains uncertain. While Cupra presses ahead with its launch of EVs, an electric Seat remains on the backburner. ‘I wouldn’t rule out going forward for Seat that we might need an electric entry model, but this would have to be profitable,’ says Griffiths, CEO of both Cupra and Seat. ‘We cannot invest on projects that are not profitable and this why we believe now is not the time to electrify Seat. When we get to 2030 with a 40 per cent EV share in Spain, that will be the time, but as of now with a five per cent share, it’s not the time.’ Griffiths said that Seat is ‘still in good shape’ but that an electric line-up would be needed for it to have a ‘long-term future’. The brand also seems unwilling to spin off a Seat version of the , due to be revealed later in 2025. ‘A decision on a Seat electric vehicle will need to be made by the end of the decade for Seat to continue, and will be necessary. At the moment it’s not our priority as we have so much other stuff to do.’ Despite Seat’s ageing line-up – its newest car, the is now five years old – its sales still grew by 7.5 per cent in 2024 to around 312,000 units, and remain ahead of Cupra (just). But it leaves an ailing line-up, more so following the seven-seat being discontinued last year. Seat has already confirmed that its and will be updated later in 2025 with new mild-hybrid engines and styling updates, but they’re unlikely to be significant. Considering both cars have been on sale since 2017, it leaves them feeling rather outdated. But there is still life left in them, stresses Griffiths, with the Ibiza, Arona and Leon all remaining on sale ‘until the end of the decade’. ‘We’ll then make a decision whether we stay on with combustion cars or invest further in Seat.’ While things might remain stagnant at Seat, you can’t say the same at Cupra. Last year it introduced significant updates for the and , while it also launched the and at the end of 2024 as two new models. Next up is the Cupra Raval, its that will serve as the sibling car to the . Cupra has now confirmed the Raval will be unveiled at September’s Munich motor show, where the wraps will also be pulled off the ID.2. Sales for both are unlikely to start until 2026. The Spanish carmaker has taken the lead with the development of these compact EVs, with production of both taking place at Seat’s Martorell factory, close to Barcelona. Cupra has been a huge success story for the Volkswagen Group, with annual sales close to overtaking those of Seat. By the end of 2025 it’s expected to have notched up more than a million sales, not bad considering it only launched in late 2018 with the and existed with just the one car until 2021. But it encountered its major hiccup in 2024 when soon after production of the commenced in China, the on all cars made in the country. Produced in the province of Anhui and rebadged as a Volkswagen for the Chinese market, despite negotiations with the EU, Cupra has had to swallow 20 per cent tariffs on its flagship . Cupra’s boss is unsurprisingly unhappy about the EU’s tariffs on Chinese-produced EVs, saying: ‘The EU’s decision to impose tariffs on EVs from China has had a direct impact on one of our latest launches, the Cupra Tavascan. ‘Bluntly, protectionism and tariffs don’t work because they slow down the adoption of electric vehicles, damage consumer confidence and in time also threaten jobs. We’re working closely with governments and Europe on getting an answer. ‘There is support there but as yet we don’t have a solution and time is running out. We’ve taken a significant financial hit [the 20 per cent EU tariff] and we still are. We can’t go on like this,’ said Griffiths. Cupra is continuing to march ahead with perhaps its boldest commitment to date – launching in the US. Planning to enter the world’s second largest car market by 2030, the Spanish firm hopes to rely on the Volkswagen Group’s expertise and infrastructure, and is looking at producing cars there to avoid potential tariffs. Cupra initially said it planned to launch in the US with only electric models, though has quickly changed its mind given slow EV sales in the States. Griffiths said: ‘We are convinced that going to the US is the right step for Cupra but also helping the [Volkswagen] group in the US. ‘We originally said we would go to the US with only EVs but if we did that today we would certainly not be happy because 90 per cent of the market remains combustion. We can’t bet on one horse because of government, regulations and tariffs, but we need to stay flexible and bet on both technologies.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
7,New BYD megawatt hyperchargers can top up your EV's battery as fast as filling up with petrol,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/byd-charging/,Paula Cullington,2025-03-18,Car Magazine UK,"Chinese EV giant has unveiled what it claims to be a game-changing ultra-fast charging system, potentially bringing electric vehicle charging times closer to those of petrol refuelling. The company also confirmed plans to establish its own charging network across China for the first time. The new Super e-Platform is said to offer peak DC charging speeds of 1000kW – more than double the fastest rival charging platform and BYD claims it could add 249 miles (400km) of range in just five minutes. That’s a breakthrough that would ease one of the primary concerns for electric vehicle owners — long charging times. The hypercharger tech was announced by founder Wang Chuanfu during a live-streamed event from BYD’s Shenzhen headquarters on 17 March 2025 and BYD’s European chief Stella Li has confirmed to CAR that the tech will be launched in the UK in the years ahead. To achieve these charging speeds, BYD has developed a suite of advanced technologies in its latest EV architecture for future models. These include batteries capable of handling a 10C charging rate — allowing them to charge at 10x their capacity per hour — along with high-power motors, high-voltage silicon carbide power chips and fast chargers that support up to 1000 kW of power. According to , Chinese EV manufacturers are utilising fast-charging tech as a key selling point to entice buyers and ‘such technologies have been credited to contributing to the high adoption of EVs in China.’ Achieving a 1000kW peak charge rate is the holy grail: a ‘megawatt’ of power, meaning that 2km (1.2 miles) of range is added every , according to BYD. The charger itself is unusually compact, taking up just 1.5sq m, and it comes with two plugs per pod. BYD’s new charging technology positions the company ahead of many competitors in the EV market, with its charging speeds leapfrogging the 500 kW capability of Tesla’s latest Supercharger V4. This dramatic reduction in charging times could provide the Chinese manufacturer with a significant edge, addressing one of the key hurdles for widespread electric vehicle adoption: the time it takes to recharge. ‘The megawatt chargers will come to the UK,’ Li told CAR at an event in London. ‘We have two cars that will have the feature, but it will take several years for the chargers to arrive.’ BYD’s current UK line-up — the , , , and — still runs on the existing e-Platform 3.0, which supports batteries up to 82.5kWh and charging speeds of up to 150kW. New models are arriving thick and fast, Li pledging a European line-up of 13 models within 18 months. The new models debuting the hypercharger tech are the revised Han L saloon and Tang L SUV. They are due to launch in China later in 2025.

8,Audi’s 7500 job losses point to 2025 ‘not being any easier’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/gernot-dollner/,Ben Oliver,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"Just a day after it announced that it would cut 7500 jobs in Germany, Audi has revealed why it needs to: a set of disappointing sales, revenue and profit figures for 2024 which are unlikely to improve much in 2025. The job losses have been agreed by the works council and will save the brand €1bn every year. Audi had previously confirmed that it . To win the unions’ approval for the cuts it has also announced that it will invest €8bn in its German sites over the next four years. It will also build the new entry-level EV, codenamed E3, which will replace the A1 and Q2 in Ingolstadt, reassuring those who worried that cost pressures would cause more affordable future Audis to be built at its overseas plants. Audi delivered 1.67m cars in 2024, down 12 per cent on the previous year. Of the other brands Audi controls, Bentley deliveries fell 22 per cent to 10,643, and Lamborghini’s rose 6 per cent to a new record of 10,687. Group revenue fell 8 per cent to €64.5bn, and profit dropped 38 per cent to €3.9bn. Audi CEO Gernot Dollner blamed a combination of geopolitical changes, a tough economic climate, inconsistent subsidies for EVs, supply bottlenecks and an unprecedented change in Audi’s model line-up, which will leave it with the newer range than all its rivals by the end of this year but will cost it sales as old models are faded out and new ones ramp up. CFO Jurgen Rittersberger said that the financial underperformance will not affect the brand’s plans to . ‘The reach and popularity of F1 are increasingly considerably,’ he said. ‘Our motivations haven’t changed.’ Dollner said Audi will continue to produce ICE, hybrid and fully electric vehicles indefinitely, and until ‘market conditions’ allowed combustion engines to be phased out. He refused to put a date on that, or to be drawn on whether , VW’s new US-focussed SUV brand. . The production version of the first car from Audi’s China-only sub-brand produced in conjunction with SAIC will be shown at the Shanghai motor show in April, he said, and two more models will follow, all featuring self-driving software from Huawei. Dollner also said that Audi was learning how to design and engineer new models faster from its Chinese partners, with a forthcoming model currently under development in Ingolstadt set to be completed in around two years, instead of the five more common at an established carmaker. Rittersberger said that Audi’s revenues should improve by at least €3bn this year to €67.5bn, but Dollner warned that despite the changes 2025 ‘will not be any easier: quite the contrary’.

9,"China’s EVs are winning on tech, not just price",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/chinese-brands-technology-race/,Mark Rainford,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"e Tesla is often perceived as the technology leader among makers, but there’s a growing band of challengers for that crown. A look at reveals a wealth of smart thinking on batteries, chargers, assistance systems and more, combined with a focus on moving swiftly from drawing board to production line. Just check out the so-called Golden Battery found in the new 007, a rival for the from , part of the Geely group. Zeekr claims to be the fastest-growing electric brand in the world. Developed in house, the Golden Battery is a 75kWh prismatic LFP power pack capable (on the correct charger) of getting from 10 to 80 per cent charged in just 10 and a half minutes. That makes the 007 the fastest-charging mass-produced EV in the world, claims Zeekr. And Zeekr has been rolling out 1000kW ultra-fast chargers within China, so this isn’t purely academic. The 007 has a range of 427 miles according to CLTC, the Chinese equivalent of WLTP and EPA ratings (if unlikely to translate to European and US conditions without losing a few miles); it can add over 300 miles of range inside 15 minutes. That’s ahead of any Tesla. With a dual-motor set-up producing 637bhp and 524lb ft, it’s also claimed to beat a on acceleration. Moving on from Zeekr to another vowel-averse Chinese brand, Avatr, we find a rival for the Tesla Model S, the 12 (pronounced one-two). This is claimed to have class-leading autonomous driving technology, in the form of Huawei’s latest Qiankun 3.0 system. Combined with no fewer than three lidar units on the 12, it makes the car capable of driving autonomously around urban roads in China as well as remote valet parking, where it’ll deliver your car to a set space in a parking lot without you being inside. With Tesla’s latest Full Self Driving not available in China, it’s hard to give a direct comparison. But the Huawei/Avatr system has proved itself on China’s crowded and often chaotic roads, so it should at least go toe-to-toe with Tesla. We’ve learned to never underestimate Tesla, but the is starting to look dated now that some of the competition has moved on quite significantly. None more so than the newly refreshed , which will be heading to Europe in the near future. Launched in 2022 and updated twice since then, the ET7 is the first Nio to benefit from the company’s push further upmarket, and now sports a Maybach-busting spec list in addition to Nio’s ground-breaking battery-swap technology. While Tesla’s expansive Supercharger network has done a great job of spreading the convenience of reliable charging infrastructure over many territories, Nio has taken a different approach: an owner should be able to acquire a fully charged battery in around three minutes in a fully automated process. Nio’s 2500-plus swap stations have completed more than 50 million battery changes since 2018. The network is very much focused on China at the moment – but when the cars come to the UK, so will battery-swap stations. The best Nio currently offers is a semi-solid-state 150kWh battery, which boss William Li took on a livestreamed 621-mile drive earlier this year. The 100kWh battery in a Model S can’t quite manage 400 miles. And there’s more. The is an MPV, launched earlier this year, with bullet-train styling and some remarkable charging speeds for its 102.7kWh battery: a claimed 12 minutes from 10 to 80 per cent. With peak charging power of more than 520kW and a curve that never dips under 300kW, the Mega’s range between charges – 441 miles according to CLTC – is helped by a slippery drag coefficient of just 0.215. Denza started out life as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz. Poor sales and, frankly, poor products led Mercedes to dial its share down to 10 per cent. But of late the brand has flourished. Its flagship is the Z9 GT, with styling that echoes the Porsche Panamera. It’s available as pure EV or a range extender. It has rear wheels that can point in opposing directions, giving the ability to pivot the car around one of the front wheels; drive nose-first into a parallel parking space, then rotate the rear into position by selecting your chosen angle on the centre screen. This also enables the Z9 to manoeuvre diagonally through tight spaces, and complete a conventional U-turn in just 4.62 metres. Smart. And, like all of these Chinese EVs, there’s also a long list of convenience and infotainment features on the Z9. It’s not unusual for these cars’ audio systems to feature 20-plus speakers, big screens for rear passengers, fridges, hot-stone massaging and plenty more. Some of these cars will soon be available outside China, as will much of the tech. And even if not all the claims match up to the closest scrutiny, you can see why some Western manufacturers are sympathetic to the idea of imposing tariffs on Chinese cars… Mark has worked as a journalist and commentator for more than a decade – and has come to focus on the fast-growing Chinese car industry.

10,Perseus: Brit-based new EV brand will launch in 2027 with SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/perseus/suv/,Jake Groves,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"Meet Perseus – the latest electric car brand to enter the market, confirming the launch of a ‘performance and technology-focused compact SUV’ in 2027. Yep, another player in the EV market – and another player developing an all-electric SUV. Perseus is based in the UK, founded by Mohammed Yehya El Bakkali. The electric car brand has ‘emerged from stealth mode,’ setting up partnerships with OEMs and suppliers to get its vision off the ground. It’s also hired a number of executives from JLR, Lotus, Bentley and Ineos. And, for reference, the name Perseus comes from Greek mythology. Perseus was a monster slayer and son of Zeus. The new brand’s first new car will utilise an existing battery-electric platform from another car maker, Perseus confirms. ‘Perseus already has agreements in principle with a European OEM Group to licence a cutting-edge EV platform and a leading Italian styling house to meet all design and engineering standards,’ says founder El Bakkali. Options include Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, as well as Stellantis’ STLA platforms. As well as the battery and drive tech, Perseus says it has also teamed up with ‘a world-leading Human Machine Interface (HMI), Artificial Intelligence technology and automotive software specialist’ to ensure the tech on the inside is cutting edge.

11,THIS IS SPARTAN: the cut-price EV G-Class from Czechia,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mw-motors/spartan/,Graham King,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"This chunky G-Wagen looking thing is the Spartan EV 2.0, an electric off-roader so capable its ancient Greek namesakes could have used it to simply drive round the Persians at Thermopylae. Possibly. Regardless, it’s newly available in the UK in five-door form, following on from the short-wheelbase three-door launched in 2024. Understandable, as its arrival wasn’t loudly heralded. However, it was talked about in the farming, forestry and mining press, which tells you something about this thing’s target market. That’s not to say it isn’t usable on-road, but we’ll come back to that in a bit. The Spartan is built by Czech firm MW Motors, using the bodyshell and ladder-frame chassis of the Force Motors Gurkha – an ultra-rugged 4×4 built in India. Power comes from a 61.1kWh made in China. The rest of the Spartan is MWM’s own work, including the interior, control systems and electric motor. It’s quite a compact vehicle, measuring 4390mm long and 1865mm wide – all the better for tackling tight and twisty trails. But it’s comparatively lofty at 2095mm tall, which could make it tricky to get under carpark height restrictions. The five-door is available with two, four or six seats (the latter in three rows); the two-seat version has a load capacity of 2597 litres. It can carry a payload of 1025kg and tow 3000kg, as well. Standard kit includes aircon, digital dials, infotainment and tyre pressure monitoring. There’s clearly some very clever stuff going on in the electric motor because, though it produces a modest 174bhp, there’s a monstrous 793lb/ft of torque. Combine that easy-access muscle with the lack of a conventional gearbox and ultra-heavy-duty off-roading should be an absolute doddle. That torque doesn’t translate to outright performance, though. MWM doesn’t even quote a 0-62mph time for the Spartan but does note the top speed would be 109mph if it wasn’t limited to 90. As for range, MWM claims the LWB Spartan will go 142 miles between charges – slightly less than the three-door version. Apparently, that’s plenty for a typical user’s weekly needs. It’ll recharge at 90kW, a 20-80% boost theoretically taking 36 minutes. It should be extremely capable. It is, after all, intended for users who tackle the toughest terrain imaginable every day. The suspension layout is a tried-and-tested combination of independent front and solid rear axles, with coil springs and anti-roll bars at both ends. You can manually switch between two- and four-wheel drive; there’s low ratio for the latter, as well. There’s also hill descent control and, if you prefer to DIY, you can turn the ABS off for better control. Add to that 240mm of ground clearance, a 700mm wading depth, approach and departures angles of 38 and 35 degrees, and a break-over angle of 35 degrees, and there are probably very few situations the Spartan can’t extricate itself from. And when you’re done playing in the mud/sand/rocks, you’ve got vehicle-to-load to power your tools or camp site. Right now. The Spartan costs £53,505 plus VAT, which isn’t exactly cheap but is less than a third the price of an electric G-Class. That’s not really the point, though. The four- and six-seat versions may be perfectly decent road cars, but the two-seater is almost certain to sell in much greater numbers to forestry services, utility companies and assorted other QUANGOs that are looking for electric alternatives to their fleets of diesel pickups and ancient Land Rovers.

12,Skyactiv-Z: ‘ultimate combustion’ engine to be used in new Mazda hybrids,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mazda-skyactiv-z/,Jake Groves,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"Mazda has announced an all-new generation of engine technology, designed to be electrified. It’s called Skyactiv-Z and it will make up part of a hybrid powertrain in future cars from the brand. The new engine, says Mazda, ‘will form the core of Mazda’s line-up for small products in the electrification era’ in a four-cylinder configuration, and is designed to meet the latest emissions standards (including Euro7) around the world. Mazda says the new Skyactiv-Z technology is ‘close to the ultimate combustion’ engine, and promises both ‘high fuel economy and driving performance.’ The technology will also be applied to the brand’s straight-six engine range for larger cars, and Mazda says plenty of the learnings regarding emissions control can be applied to rotary engines, too. As well as refining the combustion process, Mazda also says it has reduced the amount of components in the Skyactiv-Z engine compared to other engine families. The engine is the latest in quirky and interesting combustion technologies developed by Mazda. For example, the previous engine family – Skyactiv-X (pictured above) – used variable compression ratios to increase fuel economy, launching first in . We’ll see the first use of Skyactiv-Z technology in the next-generation , confirmed for launch in 2027. Given the fact the tech can be used in a variety of configurations, this could be applied to a future MX-5 or a replacement for the long lost RX-7. The news comes as part of a raft of changes and new-generation technologies Mazda is announcing for a new generation of cars, including new infotainment technology and the confirmation of an in-house-developed EV that’ll launch in 2027. ‘As the automotive industry is going through a once-in-a-century seismic shift, Mazda keeps on evolving,’ says Mazda president and CEO, Masahiro Moro.

13,Longbow looses shot at sports car establishment,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/longbow/speedster-roadster/,Graham King,2025-03-19,Car Magazine UK,"A new British sports car maker by the name of Longbow has revealed its two-model range, promising to ‘re-energise’ the form for the EV era. Indeed, Longbow claims to have inaugurated a new market sector, the ‘featherweight electric vehicle’ (FEV), with its open-top Speedster and Roadster coupe. Longbow appears not to be your average vapourware money incinerator, either. The company’s founders number two car industry execs who have worked for Tesla and Lucid among others, and the former CEO of X shore, an electric boat maker that did much to establish the market for such things. The engineering team includes people with experience in high-end OEMs and Formula 1. Beneath their classically styled bodies, the Speedster and Roadster have a bespoke lightweight aluminium platform that contributes to both cars weighing less than 995kg. That’s half the weight of the , the only vaguely comparable car currently on the market. Actually, the convertible Speedster tips the scales at 895kg – a truly remarkable achievement if it actually hits that mark. Lightness doesn’t come at the expense of range either, Longbow claiming WLTP of 275 miles for the Speedster. There’s no word on how big the battery is, but it doesn’t have to be especially so in such a light car. Longbow haven’t mentioned how much power there is, or how many motors there are, but does quote a 0-62mph time of 3.6 seconds. Longbow said in a press release: “Development of the Speedster and Roadster has pursued a singular philosophy: simplify, focus on beauty and engagement, then relentlessly add lightness, until all that remains is sheer automotive intoxication. Antithetical to conventional notions of what a battery electric vehicle can be, Speedster and Roadster are striking, light, nimble, balanced, and engineered for an unparalleled driving experience.” It’s true that car makers are struggling to get their heads around engineering EVs that are truly engaging to drive – and desirable. Hyundai created a car that’s genuinely fun in the , albeit by applying a thick layer of coding; the MG Cyberster is more of a cruiser, Maserati has cancelled the MC20 Folgore for lack of demand and Porsche is reportedly struggling to perfect the electric Boxster. We’ll have to wait and see if the Longbow is as engaging to drive as a combustion-powered equivalent, but its lightness gives it a fighting chance. The Speedster launches first, priced from £84,995 – quite low a hand-built car. Longbow says only 150 will be built, of which there will be 10 Luminary 1 Edition cars and 25 Autograph Editions. Longbow hasn’t elaborated on what features those editions will have. Once all the Speedsters have gone, production of the Roadster will start, with prices starting at £64,995. Production numbers aren’t capped, though there will only be 50 of the Luminary and 100 of the Autograph. You can reserve both cars now.

14,You can now have a Bugatti Tourbillon with EIGHT exhaust pipes,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bugatti/tourbillon/,Ben Miller,2025-03-20,Car Magazine UK,"Bugatti has unveiled a performance pack for the Tourbillon… as if that car needed any MORE. It’s called the Équipe Pur Sang package, which translates to ‘thoroughbred team’ – and it’s actually more of a set of visual trimmings more than anything else. That said – what a set of visual trimmings. So much so that the pack features an eight-pipe exhaust package, almost as if someone’s reversed a Tourbillon into a pipe organ. A new front splitter and revised rear wing are designed to further improve aerodynamics. New super lightweight wheels feature, too, which Bugatti claims improve air flow to the rear radiators by eight per cent. Inside, the Équipe Pur Sang models include black upholstery and unique stitching, as well as Alcantara-upholstered performance seats. Of course, we say ‘you’ can now have this spec, but we likely predict that only a handful will ever be able to order such a thing. Want to know more about the ‘standard’ Tourbillon? Keep reading… The 21 century Bugatti, named Tourbillon, will go on sale in 2026 priced at €3.8 million apiece. Just 250 will be built and, even at that price, predicts the kind of riot usually reserved for Taylor Swift tickets. Why? Because in the entire history of a marque famous for engineering eccentricity and excess, the all-new Tourbillon sits top of the pile as the maddest of them all. A 1775bhp plug-in hybrid with three e-motors and a Cosworth-developed, 8.3-litre V16 engine with precisely no turbochargers, it is faster, smarter and prettier than the outgoing . From its gemstone-encrusted driver’s instruments to its 276.5mph top speed, it is also testament to the imagination and creative willpower of one man, Bugatti Rimac CEO Mate Rimac. Good question. Rimac: ‘Early on there was a lot of discussion, particularly with the management, with Porsche. They were insistent the car had to be electric. EV would have been the obvious and easy thing to do. With the Nevera I already had a 1900bhp electric hypercar, and we could have easily transferred that technology or, as we showed with , re-skinned it – easy-peasy. But it was clear to me this was the wrong way for Bugatti, and I had to fight like hell to do another combustion engine. I wanted to elevate it to a higher level. It comes back to the same words that drove Romano Artioli [orchestrator of Bugatti’s second age, in the early ’90s] and Ferdinand Piëch: if it is comparable then it is not a Bugatti. It’s a simple sentence but a clear brief. A Bugatti has to be unique.’ The Tourbillon is certainly unique. More than half of the car’s total power output comes from the V16, the rest being the product of a 28kWh battery, a motor out back and one on each front wheel. The engine weighs in at 252kg, some 150kg lighter than the old W16 – a clue to the subtle but significant shift in philosophy Mate has brought about at Molsheim. Deeply impressive but oddly anodyne to drive, the Veyron and Chiron were not touchy-feely cars. Their performance was also the product of brute force over drag, weight and the other downsides of rampant mechanical complexity. Mate’s first Bugatti is a little leaner (power is nearly 300bhp up on the Chiron but kerbweight is down), a little smarter (minimising drag was an obsession) and more emotionally resonant (an astonishing engine racket, plus more tactile steering), all while doubling down on the brand’s reputation for barely conceivable numbers: 0-62mph in two seconds flat, 0-124mph in less than five, 0-248mph in less than 25 seconds and 276.5mph, erm, . The V16 features a 90° bank angle, 92mm x 78.55mm bore and stroke dimensions and a punchy 14.5:1 compression ratio that calls to mind the good old pre-turbo days. The vee angle brings sweet balance and the crossplane crank (versus a flatplane arrangement) a sense of near-limitless torque. There are no turbos because the engine’s here to provide noise and theatre, and turbochargers tend to dull both. Their additional grunt isn’t required either, thanks to the electric powertrain. As wild as the engine is the cockpit, complete with analogue instrumentation inspired by luxury watches and a fixed-hub steering wheel. There are also no permanent screens. The logic is flawless: the big-screen race is a zero-sum game and, by definition, the digital cannot be timeless. Mate Rimac: ‘We wanted to create something that wouldn’t date even though we are trapped in the technology of our time.’ The instruments comprise more than 600 parts (some in titanium; others in gemstones…), weigh just 700g (less than half that of their digital equivalent, Mate insists) and work with the kind of eerie precision that comes of tolerances as fine as 5 microns. The speedometer’s mechatronic assembly alone comprises 250 parts. ‘We wanted to keep the value in the car, and to countersteer the trend of the industry,’ explains Rimac. ‘In a digital world of more and more screens you all converge on the same thing.’ The Tourbillon certainly isn’t more of the same thing. A labour of love still in frenzied development, it’s the car Bugatti needed to build – and the car it simply couldn’t build while it remained an integral part of the VW Group.

15,Outgunned and outpaced: why Lamborghini’s V10 had to go,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lamborghini/replacing-v10/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"► Lamborghini’s legendary V10 is no more. Last seen in the outgoing , the wailing 10-cylinder has been dropped by the new Temerario and replaced with a hybrid V8 twin-turbo unit. Designated L411 internally, it uses two turbos and three Yasa e-motors for a solid step up on paper: power is 907bhp, it launches to 62mph in just 2.7 seconds and top speed is 213mph. But it screams one obvious question. ‘Why turbo?’ pre-empts Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer, Rouven Mohr at the UK launch of the Sant’Agata’s new baby. ‘We’re coming from a naturally-aspirated V10 that everyone loves and is from the emotional side – a very fantastic engine.’ We agree. The V10 was so much more than just headline figures, delivering one of the most emotive driving experiences around – and of the few without forced-induction to boot. In a world of more hybrids and turbocharged engines, it was a privilege to drive, rewarding you the more you chased its sonorous redline. Replacing it wasn’t taken lightly, and the V8 twin-turbo Lamborghini chose was the product of an intensive search for a successor. Whatever replaced the V10 had to achieve two key goals: First, to bring more power to compete with the increasingly powerful competition. And next, to create a similarly emotive experience to go with them. ‘There was a V8 turbo and there was also V6 turbo – or there was a new naturally-aspirated V10,’ says Mohr of the options. ‘The turbo choice was quite clear, mainly driven by the performance level that the segment has reached,’ he adds. ‘If you look at especially the last five years in this segment, the power increase is quite significant.’ The Gallardo launched with around 500bhp and the with 600bhp – but that pales in comparison to the 900 plus horses the Temerario packs in. The goalposts have moved, and Lamborghini’s engineers needed a new weapon to aim at them. ‘We had to find a solution to close the gap, and to overtake,’ Mohr admits. Introducing an all-new naturally aspirated V10 was unfeasible for two key reasons: product positioning and durability. To account for power losses due to emission laws, Lamborghini engineers would have had to develop a fresh V10 with a significantly increased displacement – ultimately putting it too close to the 6.5-litre V12 in the Revuelto flagship. Increasing the rev limit was the only another solution – but that too came with a drawback: ‘You’d have to rev 12000rpm or something like that,’ says Mohr. ‘On the production scale of [the Temerario] it’s simply not possible. You can do it for a hypercar – or if you want to produce 500 cars. But for this kind of volume, it’s not an option.’ Sticking with forced-induction was the most logical approach, but after that it seems Sant’Agata’s engineers were focused on the spirit and emotion at the heart of its new supercar. There was a choice between a V6 and a V8, and while the V6 would’ve likely provided enough power – you only need to look at hypercars like the and Mercedes-AMG One – Mohr and his team picked the V8: ‘A V6 would be too big a step to go to from the V10,’ he reasons. ‘And on top, from the pure emotional potential, the V8 with a flat crankshaft, has bigger potential from the pure emotional sound.’ A V8 twin-turbo delivered everything in terms of performance – but it lacked the character and spirit of what had come to before. ‘It was another V8 twin-turbo on top of the already existing 10,500 twin-turbos that you have on the planet,’ Mohr admits. Efficient, balanced – and a bit boring – it was obvious solution to the problem, but needed more to follow the Huracan’s V10. ‘We needed a little bit roughness in the engine,’ admits Mohr.  ‘This is provided with a flat crankshaft, because we have automatically some vibrations in the car that we want to have.’ With an extra edge on the noise department, Mohr’s team next looked at response and engagement. Filling the gap left by the 10-cylinder wouldn’t be easy – unless the Lamborghini had a unique party piece compared to its competitors: ‘We said, “okay, what if we would do an engine that revs up to 10,000rpm because so far, no one did it,” Mohr tells us – noting that the super-limited AMG One’s V6 doesn’t really compare to the Temerario’s use case: ‘This engine was really designed on a white sheet of paper,’ explains Mohr. ‘There is not any component carrying over from another engine – or even from the LMDh engine’ To achieve super-linear response across the entire 10,000rpm rev range, Lamborghini had to fit huge turbochargers, which came with their own problem. ‘This is only possible if you have the electrified components, because otherwise the engine is dead in the mid rev region – especially from the lagginess.’ Enter the final part of the equation, three Yasa e-Motors – two on the front axle – and specifically one  sandwiched between the engine and eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The latter motors removes turbo lag entirely, and all three add to the 789bhp and 538lb ft of torque from the V8 alone. ‘We combined the best things of a naturally-aspirated engine,’ Mohr says. ‘The best things of a turbo and [hybrid tech]. If you mix up these things, you end up with some very unique behaviour.’ That’s one phrase for it: the result is an engine that has the mid-range boost of a forced-induction engine combined the reward for revving to the redline a naturally-aspirated engine brings. Throw in a crankshaft designed for racing character rather than outright performance, and L411 is as close as you can get to the V10 of before.

16,"Quadrifoglio models 'should roar,' says Alfa Romeo executive",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/future-of-quadrifoglio/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"Alfa Romeo has some challenging years ahead. The brand has embarked on the Sisyphean task of convincing its petrol-swilling customers that electric motors can be interesting and, crucially, that it’s hottest won’t lose any of their charm if they’re forced to surrender their V6 engines. But Alfa’s efforts haven’t yet amounted to much, as the public response to the notion of an electric Quadrifoglio has been scathing. Alfa drivers want Alfa engines, not electric motors. The same sentiments are being expressed by fans of other performance car brands – and they’re forcing manufacturers to make some serious changes to their electrification plans. In March 2025, for example, by announcing it was ‘evaluating’ a new, petrol-powered SUV to compensate for the Macan EV’s disappointingly slow sales. by replacing the brand’s thundering V8s with plug-in hybrid four-cylinder powertrains. Alfa has finally cottoned onto the trend – and it’s set about saving its V6 engine from the executioner. I had the company’s current plans for the future of Quadrifoglio explained to me by Cristiano Fiorio, head of the Alfa Romeo’s marketing and communication department. He told me: ‘everyone expresses the fact that they want an Alfa Romeo with a Quadrifoglio. This is pretty clear […] because Quadrifoglio is the pinnacle of the brand – and we will continue to have Quadrifoglio forever. That’s a no brainer.’ But then, Fiorio dropped a bomb. He said: ‘Personally, . I see a Quadrifoglio which has the sound of a real engine. As of now. Maybe in five years things will change. But as of now, the Quadrifoglio to me – to us – . ‘That is something that is expressed by fans – by customers – because the penetration of Quadrifoglio in many markets is very interesting. So, we will have to continue to give to clients what they want.’ I then pressed Fiorio for details on whether Alfa Romeo’s current 2.9-litre V6 engine could be updated to comply with Euro 7 emissions standards and beyond, thus extending its usable life into the (seen winter testing below) and next Giulia’s production cycles. He furrowed his brow and chucked me an exasperated expression before saying: ‘if I tell you yes or no, I am telling you exactly which engine we’ll have in Giulia and Stelvio – but I tell you that you said something that is not far from our thoughts. ‘At the end of the day, if you express a high powertrain version for the Giulia and Stelvio which – by the way – are big cars, I would not see two, three, four cylinders.’ Then, through a wry smile, he said: ‘I don’t know. Maybe it’s easier with six cylinders.’ Plus, Fiorio hinted that it’s technically possible to drop Alfa’s 2.9-litre V6 into the STLA Large architecture that’ll sit under the new Stelvio (above) and Giulia. ‘The platform was developed to be a multi energy. So, there is zero problem to adapting the platform to kind of engine. It was developed to not to stick only with electrification. There is no problem at all.’ He made it clear that he doesn’t like how complicated modern cars are – and he said he’s going to address that with the new Stelvio and Giulia. ‘The cars today have too much,’ he said. ‘In general, cars have too much. Too many buttons, too much technology. ‘Why? Because, of course, the development of technology helps a lot – and when it helps to save lives, I love it. It’s more than fine. But then, the cars have to be driven and I want the pleasure of driving, not the pleasure of playing a video game or having an infotainment in the car to look at movies. That, I don’t think at all is the purpose of our brand. ‘The purpose of our brand is to give to customers cars that are nice to drive – and when you want to drive and you want to feel the pleasure of driving, they respond to your needs. If you have to understand the technology before driving, that cannot be an Alfa Romeo.’ I’ve been worried about Alfa Romeo’s prospects under Stellantis since the merger, especially given the group’s fixation on homogeneity and electrification. But my chat with Fiorio has restored my faith. If he gets his own way, the next Giulia might just dish out the same thrashing to the BMW M5 as its predecessor handed to the M3. Here’s hoping.

17,"‘Smart has always wanted to go big,’ says European CEO",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/smart/dirk-adelmann/,Jake Groves,2025-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"Think the new is an unholy size for something wearing the Smart badge? Turns out it has always been the plan to expand the model range and, indeed, the size of Smart’s cars – according to Dirk Adelmann, CEO of Smart Europe. Adelmann is a Mercedes-Benz Group lifer, and has been involved in the Smart brand from its roots by helping to launch the brand into new markets when he joined the company in 2003. He’s also been in his current role as CEO since Smart was revitalised into the brand it is now, so it makes sense that he knows his stuff about what makes Smart and its customers tick. ‘We’ve never defined Smart as small,’ he says, ‘and we have always said a Smart can come in many shapes and forms. ‘When we had a product offensive in 2005, which included the Roadster, and … we also had the ForMore,’ says Adelmann. ‘That was already developed and ready to launch but then restructuring happened.’ The ForMore (pictured above in concept form) was designed as a high-riding compact SUV, complete with the Smart design language, that was meant to expand the brand’s model line-up in Europe. The aim was for it to capitalise on the increasingly attractive SUV market – as well as introduce more Smart models in the B and C segments. Reports say the ForMore was meant to utilise the same architecture as the of the era to enable all-wheel drive and bigger power outputs. ‘We always wanted to go into these segments with an SUV shape,’ says Adelmann, ‘because it made a lot of sense. Finally, with #5, we can go there and with the right technology.’ This development has come about by leveraging both of Smart’s joint venture partners, Mercedes-Benz (which Adelmann calls the ‘German mother’) as well as Geely. All of Smart’s current cars run on Geely platforms for economies of scale; the and use SEA2 that’s shared with the and the , while the #5 uses PMA, an architecture used by the . ‘But this, for us, isn’t the end of the line. We’ve now successfully launched three cars in new segments for Smart using odd numbers, and we have reserved the even ones in between for something non-SUV,’ adds Adelmann. ‘From that you can deduct that we are planning more than just SUVs. ‘We aren’t an SUV company, we’re an EV company – and the platform that we are now on [with #5] would enable an even bigger car,’ says Adelmann. ‘But if we were talking about smaller sizes, there is a limit. But with Geely and Mercedes behind you, you can imagine a lot.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017. With a decade of car news and reviews writing under his belt, he became CAR's Deputy News Editor in 2020 and then News Editor in 2025. Jake's day-to-day role includes co-ordinating CAR's news content across its print, digital and social media channels. When he's not out interviewing an executive, driving a new car for review or on a photoshoot for a CAR feature, he's usually found geeking out on the latest video game, buying yet another pair of wildly-coloured trainers or figuring out where he can put another car-shaped Lego set in his already-full house."
18,New MG S5 EV revealed: a small electric SUV that's big on value,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/s5-ev/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-03-25,Car Magazine UK,"► You’re looking at the new MG S5 EV, yet another new challenger in the increasingly busy B-segment SUV market and the fifth EV from the brand. It’ll ride on the same Modular Scalable Platform as the incredibly successful 4 hatchback and MG bosses will be hoping for similar success: the hatchback has sold 42,000 units in the UK since its launch back in September 2022, and it’s now the third best-selling EV in private retail. Yes, and for good reason. The B-segment electric SUV is booming right now, and everyone from Skoda and Fiat to Kia and BYD is looking for a piece of the action. ‘You know, this segment is about 30% of the UK car market,’ said David Allison, MG UK’s head of Product and Planning at a preview event earlier this year. ‘It’s a great time for us to be launching a new model in it.’ ‘It seems that everyone is launching this type of car at once,’ he adds. We’d agree, there’s been a flurry of in 2025, with everything from the to the Grande Panda and launching this year. That means more choice for consumers, but more of a headache for the brands competing. ‘It’s a segment of the market which fits really well for battery electric cars,’ Allison tells us. ‘It’s been on a massive rise.’  Measuring 4476mm by 1849 by 1621mm the S5 EV is a touch larger and higher than the MG 4 and offers 453-litres of boot space to the hatchback’s 363-litres. The styling of the MG S5 EV is equally conservative, largely sticking to the MG 4’s inoffensive looks, albeit stretched over a slightly larger frame. It gets a split grille to echo MG’s flagship Cyberster EV, as well as integrated low beams which seem to be all the rage now. At the rear you’ll find 17- or 18-inch alloys, a roof bar and full-width light bar at the rear. There’s not a great deal to notice design-wise on the S5 EV, and it’s equally inoffensive through the air, clocking an efficient Cd of just 0.27. It’ll be available in six colours including Dynamic Red, Piccadilly Blue – and four other monochrome shades. ‘We’re taking a really, really good base for the car, putting a slightly more versatile body style on top of it, updating the interior and bringing a bit more modern technology into it, because the pace of technology and EVs changes so quickly.’ The S5 EV will come in three variants: the SE Standard Range, the SE Long Range, and the Trophy Long Range which tops the line up. The Standard Range uses a 49kWh battery for a range of 211 miles, while the larger battery used in both the SE Long Range and Trophy Long Range will last for 298 miles. Charging speed is 120kW for the two 49kWh models and a slightly faster for the 139kW for the larger battery models. When paired with a 170kW motor on the rear axle, the larger battery models can hit 62mph im a solid 6.3 seconds. Prices are £28,495 for the entry-level SE Standard Range car, with a £2500 hike for the SE Long Range car at £30,995. There’s then a further £2500 bump over the Long Range car to the £33,495 Trophy, though that gives you several extra options including heated front seats, a leather-style interior, an electric tail gate and a 360-degree camera. ‘We find that by combining the highest spec with the longest battery, that tends to be the sweet spot,’ says MG’s Allison when I ask him about which trims he think will sell the best. ‘So bigger wheels, privacy, glass, half leather, trim, heated seats, heated steering wheel, electric tailgate. There’s quite a lot of equipment in there, and on a monthly payment, it’s not a massive increase for what people would be looking to pay.’ It’s a pattern MG has seen throughout its EV range, and the S5 EV looks to repeat the trend. Inside MG says the S5 EV is a step over its previous cars and we’d agee – although the difference is slight. There are two screens, a 12.8-inch panel for the infotainment and 10.25-inch one for the cockpit dials. Both appeared sharp when we had a poke around at the car’s reveal. Equally proficient was the infotainment which zipped through menus nicely. We’d expect the same performance on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but we didn’t get to try TikTok or YouTube, which now come pre-baked into the system. MG says parts of this interior will make it into its next round of EVs, which is not a bad thing. Elsewhere, you’ll find slightly softer materials in the two-tone interior and physical buttons for climate control. The S5 EV gets seven airbags as well as the latest version of MG Pilot, the brands adaptive cruise control system. Alongside you’ll find the usual ADAS stuff such as a forward collision warning, rear cross traffic alert and other bits. There’s also an MG Pilot Custom setting which enables you to quickly and easily turn off the various legally required bongs, warnings and beeps that the S5 EV and every other new car is required to have. MG first hopes that existing 4 or ZS EV owners will be interested in the larger, more modern S5 EV – but is eyeing up the competition too. ‘We’ve spent the last four or five years stealing someone else’s customer, and that’s what we fully intend to do in the future as well,’ he says. ‘If you look at this, this segment, you look at something like a Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq, or a Hyundai Kona. All really, really great cars, you know, very, very stiff competition. But I think with the platform that this sits on with the equipment, and certainly with the price point, I think we should be able to compete with them.’ The price point will be key, as that’s where MG sees the biggest opportunity – and with private retail sales second only to Tesla from 2019 to 2024, it’s probably onto something. ‘With the Trophy, we’re finishing with the longest range, the most level of equipment, where most of our competitors started with the smaller batteries and the and the lowest ranges,’ Allison tells us. ‘And it’s a strategy that’s worked really well for us.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

19,Audi's A5 e-hybrid PHEVs claim up to 67 miles of e-range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/a5/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-03-25,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has confirmed the specs and UK prices for its plug-in hybrid A5 models, that will join the range in the summer of 2025. These new ‘e-hybrid’ models are available to order from 7 May 2025, promising up to 67 miles of e-range. For reference, the A5 is an all-new petrol- and diesel-powered compact executive car, built on a brand-new combustion-only platform. At a time when most manufacturers have stepped away from fossil fuel saloons to focus on their , it’s positively radical. The new Audi A5 replaces the A4 in the brand’s line-up, becoming a fresh rival for the and . That’s some tough competition, but Audi hopes to set itself apart from its peers with its fancy new 48-volt mild hybrid technology, some clever infotainment tech and a new 3.0-litre V6 engine for the range-topping S5. However, with progress comes casualties. By converting the A5 into a sensible, practical family hatchback (or estate), Audi has had to sacrifice the old A5 Cabriolet and Coupe. Audi isn’t too fussed, though – the brand told us they were relatively small sellers. Orders are now open for the new Audi A5, with prices starting from £41,950 for the hatchback and £43,850 for the Avant estate. It comfortably undercuts the starting price of both the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes C-Class, likely aiding its appeal. There’s a choice of Sport, S line and Edition 1 trim levels across the A5 line-up, with the S5 only available in a top-spec Edition 1 guise. Sport trim starts from £41,950, with standard features including a 14.5-inch touchscreen, large digital instrument cluster and adaptive cruise control. S line versions are expected to be the most popular, and start from £44,100. They’re distinguished by the trademark sportier bodykit, larger 19-inch wheels and sports seats. At the top of the tree sits the Edition 1, commanding a £5,000 price increase to start from £49,100. There are plenty of extras included, though, such as 20-inch trims, Matrix LED headlights and an additional touchscreen for the front-seat passenger. Want a PHEV? Those e-hybrid models are priced from £48,950 for the saloon, and £50,850 for the Avant estate. For the time being the sportier S5 is only available in the Edition 1 trim, costing from £68,700 for the hatchback and £70,600 for the Avant, making it a more expensive alternative to a BMW M440i or Mercedes-AMG C43. How the tables turn. Extra kit for the S5 (over the A5) includes Nappa leather upholstery, ventilated and massaging front seats and a Bang & Olufsen sound system. Orders for the new Audi A5 and A5 Avant are now open, with first UK deliveries expected in November. From launch, buyers will be able to choose from four newly developed engines. Entry-level models are available with two petrol units, both based on the same turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit. One produces 148bhp, while the other has 201bhp. Both units send drive to the front wheels via a double-clutch automatic gearbox as standard, although the latter unit can be optionally specified with quattro all-wheel drive. Above that is – rather unexpectedly – a 2.0-litre diesel engine. It’s a development of the VW Group’s familiar EA288 unit (which is found in everything from the to the ), and it produces a healthy 201bhp and 295 lb ft of torque. It’s available with the same gearbox and drivetrain options as the 201bhp petrol engine. After that come the plug-in hybrid models, which are now named ‘e-hybrid’ – not TFSIe like former Audi PHEVs. The powertrain used here develops a total of 249bhp via a 2.0-litre petrol engine, an electric motor and 25.9kWh battery pack. Audi claims a 5.9sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 155mph, and says you can get a maximum of 67 miles of electric range if you’re careful. At the top of the A5 range is the sporty S5. It features by a turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 engine with 362bhp and 406lb ft of torque. It’s only available with quattro all-wheel drive. This all sounds rather conventional – but Audi has an ace up its sleeve. The diesel and V6 engines are teamed with its new MHEV Plus system. This is a more advanced version of the 48-volt mild hybrid technology we’re used to seeing in pretty every car on sale. It has a bigger 1.76kWh battery pack, a more intelligent power management system and two electric motor generators. There’s one mounted in the usual place amongst the engine’s ancillaries, and one yoked to the back of the gearbox. This second motor is more efficient at harvesting electricity when decelerating – and it can power the car all on its own at speeds of up to 18mph. If you want to learn more about the system, check out our dedicated . There are also two plug-in hybrid models in the works, but we won’t see those until 2025. They’re based on Audi’s 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and will have outputs of 295bhp and 335bhp. Both will also have a maximum electric driving range of more than 100km (62 miles) and battery capacities greater than 20kWh. Audi has also tried to make the A5 better to drive than the old A4. It gave the new car stiffer front suspension mounts, a redesigned front axle, a new progressive steering system and new tyres. The brand has also paid closer attention to the calibration of its driving modes, dialling in a wider difference between comfort and sport modes. Unlike any previous Audi, that’s for sure. The infotainment system, for example, is a stark departure from the brand’s previous generation combustion cars. Like BMW, Audi has designed a new dual-screen setup that combines a digital gauge cluster and central touchscreen under one giant piece of curved glass. The former display measures 11.9 inches across, while the latter sizes up at 14.5 inches. Audi also offers an extra 10.9-inch display for the passenger side of the dash as an optional extra, which can be used for helpful things such as setting nav instructions, or selfish things like watching YouTube. Plus, you can use the screen on the move without distracting the driver thanks to a clever polarised filter. We’ve poked around the car in the studio and, we have to say, Audi’s new infotainment system is very impressive. It doesn’t feel quite as polished as BMW’s system, but it’s definitely ahead of Mercedes’ technology. The graphics are crystal clear and the processors are lightning fast, so there’s very little lag when swapping between screens. We thought the menu design already looks a little dated, though – to our eyes, the fonts and layouts are too similar to the outgoing Q5. It’s roomy, too. The new A5 is 67mm longer and 13mm wider than the old A4 – and its wheelbase is 80mm longer than its predecessor. That means there’s a lot more space inside for passengers. We sent a six-foot staffer to the car’s preview event, and he had a solid four inches of knee room and enough foot space to tap dance in. The rear seats are surprisingly comfortable, too. They’re more heavily bolstered than your average compact executive saloon and they have a very low hip-point which means your thighs are well supported. They’re also slightly staggered against the front seats, affording those in the back a clearer view out of the windscreen. Yeah. You get 445 litres of boot space in the standard A5 and 476 litres of space in the Avant. That’s quite a bit less than the 480 litres you get in the BMW 3 Series saloon, but the Audi’s boot has a hatchback rather than a traditional boot lid, which means it’s easier to load luggage into the space. Disappointingly, Audi has confirmed that boot space in outright litres drops to 361 litres for the Avant e-hybrid – likely by removing much of the under-floor space. At the preview event for the A5, Audi wheeled out its light designer to walk us through all the weird and wonderful things the brand has achieved with its head and taillights. Much like and Countryman, the Audi A5 has a range of configurable lighting signatures that can be tweaked from inside the car. The A5’s daytime running lights and taillights are made up of loads of little OLED crystals, which can be ignited and extinguished to create a range of patterns. There are eight choices for both the front and rear lights. The most unusual pattern is a gently flickering design for the taillights. At a distance, the design looks like a solid stream of light but, as you draw closer, you notice each crystal is slowly fading in and out of phase. Audi also tells us the design is powered by an algorithm that ensures the same pattern is never repeated. Rather ironically, considering the Audi driver stereotype, there’s also a dedicated safety-focused pattern for the taillights that will flash if the car behind is following too closely.

20,C’est un retour! Peugeot officially confirms return of GTi,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/peugeot/gti/,Jake Groves,2025-03-25,Car Magazine UK,"It’s official: Peugeot’s GTi cars are making a comeback. After the sporty Peugeot sub-brand has remained dormant for years, CEO Alain Favey has confirmed the name will return. The first new GTi model will be the e-208, after Favey confirmed rumours that a performance version using the old-school name will be coming soon in talks with automotive media. During these talks, Favey says that ‘driving pleasure will always be part of our DNA.’ It’s been a mission for Favey to reignite the GTi name since his appointment in February 2025. Only a few weeks into his tenure, Favey told the media during the brand’s annual E-Lion press conference: ‘I am very eager to connect the Peugeot brand and what it stands for to its past. ‘We will look back at the heritage of the brand and we will see to what extent it can be adapted to the modern world,’ he added. Performance cars from Peugeot have been few and far between in recent years, with the last GTi model being (pictured above) that was discontinued in 2019. The Peugeot Sport Engineered sub-brand effectively took over from GTi, shining a light on electrified performance with its links to Peugeot’s motorsport efforts with some lurid green trinketry. But the PSE sub-brand arguably never got off to a flying start, with its only model to wear such branding being a . We know that the E-CMP platform that underpins the 208 has more performance capacity, with the likes of Alfa Romeo with its and Abarth with the proving that ‘performance’ cars from Stellantis can be more than just a power boost. The e-208 GTi will likely run along the same lines, including better tyres and brakes as well as some additional performance technology designed to make the EV fun to drive. While there is no further comment or intel regarding when we’ll see the e-208 GTi, it is likely we could get our first glimpse of an e-208 GTi at the 2025 Le Mans endurance race.

21,Volante! Aston Martin's Vanquish super-GT loses its roof,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/vanquish/,Jake Groves,2025-03-25,Car Magazine UK,"One of the greatest names in Aston Martin’s modern history has returned, and has been applied to a serious bit of kit. This is the new Vanquish, designed as the third chapter of Aston Martin’s revamped sports car line-up alongside the and . After the coupe was unveiled in September 2024, the Brit supercar brand has just unveiled its Volante convertible. Aston Martin has started from the ground up with the new Vanquish, engineering a new version of its V12, a new architecture and introducing the brand’s newest infotainment and driving tech to the super GT. Rest assured, Aston Martin fans, this isn’t just a DB car that’s been breathed on like the . ‘I just think it’s one of the best names in the business, and you know where you stand with it,’ says Aston Martin head of brand and product strategy, Alex Long. ‘With DBS it was basically a DB11… S. There’s no sub-explanation here.’ The name also makes a comeback after the original plan was to use it for the brand’s cancelled mid-engined supercar, first previewed by a concept back in 2019. In this day and age, and whether some of us like it or not, it’s on-trend to electrify completely or, at least, hybridise. But here, with Aston Martin, the team and its engineers have made a case for continuing the use of the V12 – just as Ferrari has with the equally un-electrified 12Cilindri. ‘It took some convincing within the business to put money in the V12 cup and to say we’re keeping it at the top of the product range,’ adds Long, ‘because the other way to ease a business case is to say that we can add some volume via a middle car, but we feel we’ve got the performance envelope right here.’ And that V12 happens to be the most powerful one fitted to an Aston Martin production car. This 5.2-litre engine isn’t the same as the one in the DB12 – a new block, strengthened conrods, reprofiled camshafts and new turbochargers all feature. And those new turbos include a ‘boost reserve’ function, which effectively increases boost pressure than what is usually needed by balancing the waste gate with the intake pressure and throttle inputs; when you go for full acceleration, the throttle snaps open and the excess pressure and fuel rush through the engine. ‘With every new car we bring, we want to be at the top of the category for power,’ says Long. And Aston Martin really has; the rear-driven Vanquish develops 824bhp and 738lb ft, good for a 3.3sec 0-62mph time (for the coupe, 3.4sec for the Volante) and a top speed of 214mph. That top speed also makes the Vanquish the fastest Aston Martin production car. The DBS Superleggera that preceded it was also wildly powerful. And a bit of a handful. Which is something Aston Martin’s engineers have looked to minimise this time around. So, as well as a super-long wheelbase – 80mm longer than the DBS – the new architecture is 75 per cent stiffer than a DBS 770 Ultimate due to new crossmembers and tougher engine bracing. That does add weight – the Vanquish is 1774kg dry, 200kg more than the 12Cilindri – but Aston Martin’s engineers have sought to correct that. The tougher bracing ‘gives you benefits when it comes to steering feel,’ says Simon Newton, Aston Martin’s director of vehicle performance. ‘When you load up the entire tyre contact patch as you steer, what you’re actually feeling is the front of the car bending in the right way. That extra stiffness really helps.’ Bilstein DTX dampers also standard, with Aston Martin giving the ones here their own calibration, and Pirelli P Zero 4 tyres are standard for the 21-inch forged alloy wheels, for example. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard, too. Like Ferrari, Aston Martin has also gone down the digital route. An electronic differential features on the driven wheels – like the DB12 and Vantage – and the brand’s ‘adaptive slip controller’ includes varying steps of slackening the traction control. ‘Having that e-diff is what allows us to have a longer car [than the Vantage or DB12] that brings the benefits of high-speed stability, but we’re able to make something more agile than the outgoing model,’ adds Newton. ‘You can set the car up to be more agile and reactive at lower speeds than the previous car, then really lock it down higher up.’ The whole car’s design is instantly familiar, with many of the brand’s common design cues interwoven with some fantastically intricate details. Like DB12 and Vantage, particular effort has been made not to introduce any aerodynamic design cues that look like they’ve been added on. Aston’s trad (and massive) grille arrangement is a bit more basking shark here with its sharp, piercing top lip and the car’s sculptured wheelarches give the whole car a muscular feel. But yes, arguably the biggest visual step-change is that backside. It’s a blend of Valkyrie-inspired rear lights, upward flowing rear lip spoiler and a floating panel nicknamed the shield. Aston Martin’s designers, led by Miles Nurnberger, wanted to great a bit more visual drama, with the panel able to be painted or left in bare carbonfibre. Oh, and for the Volante model, its fabric roof with its K-fold mechanism can open in 14 seconds and raise in 16 seconds at speeds up to 31mph. Inside, a lot of Aston Martin’s modern controls and new infotainment are applied inside – albeit in a different arrangement to DB12 and Vantage, as Nurnberger and his team look to create a little more differentiation between each of Aston Martin’s cars. The Vanquish includes something Nurnberger calls the ‘chrome stitch’ – a thin metal strip that’s designed to couple together different elements of the dashboard. Oh, and this Vanquish is strictly a two-seater unlike previous flagship Aston Martin grand tourers. Instead, each car can be had with a bespoke luggage set that perfectly matches the interior. You can, but you’ll need a lot of dosh. Aston Martin is only making 1000 per year – and that includes coupe and Volante convertible models – making the Vanquish a more rare car than the DBS Superleggera ever was. Prices are well north of £350k. And that’s before you get to the Q specifications – something Aston Martin is looking to increase the amount of special versions with the new Vanquish.

22,MG Cyber GTS: logical coupe still not confirmed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/cyber-gts/,Jake Groves,2025-03-27,Car Magazine UK,"MG revealed the Cyber GTS concept at the – but we’ve not seen or heard anything about it since then. That’s why I asked MG UK’s head of product planning David Allison, about the hardtop counterpart to the going to production. Can you blame me? ‘If you look at that type of car and you and you look at the cars that have a convertible and a coupe body style in the same range, the coupe always sells far more than the convertible,’ he told me at the reveal of the new MGS 5 EV. ‘I think if it was something that we wanted to do to try and sell a few more cars, then it would be the obvious next step, if you like, for that car, but it’s not in the portfolio plan right now.’ So, not the best news. MG is still not confirming the Cyber GTS, but it’s a viable product commercial. MG has always maintained the Cyberster is about brand-building and excitement more than sales, with the current car pushing just over 300 sales since its release in September 2024. ‘From a pure sales point of view, it’s not important at all,’ said Allison. ‘It’s just for a brand like ours that has 100 years worth of history, I’ve always felt that’s something we should be celebrating. It just gives us that, that little bit of point of difference that some of the new brands coming from China can’t do – we can do stuff like that.’ But the Cyber GTS would have the nod from the brand marketing bods and the bean counters too. What’s the hold up MG? Keep reading for everything else you need to know about the Cyber GTS. MG is very keen to point out that this is still just a concept – even if the brand is taking a prototype model up the famous hillclimb during the Festival of Speed. ‘We are trying to bring the MG brand more into the future,’ said SAIC Global Design Vice President, Jozef Kaban (pictured above, left). ‘You can’t just make retro cars, copy or improve them – you have to always define something new.’ Even so, MG is keen to impress some of its now 100-year history a little more than it has before during its time as a brand under the Chinese SAIC automotive giant. So much so that the Cyber GTS is designed to be a nod to the MGC GTS Sebring – a racing car that took on the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1968 and achieved MG’s highest ever factory result. The Cyber GTS sits low to the ground, with its stretching bonnet and bluff rear end. Plenty of the Cyberster’s design cues have been carried over, with MG’s team saying the platform underpinning its electric roadster is capable of having a hardtop model, too. In fact, unlike the Cyberster, the Cyber GTS concept is defined as a 2+2. ‘And it is a real 2+2,’ says Carl Gotham, MG’s Advanced Design Director who’s also responsible for crafting the wild EXE181 show car. ‘There is a package there, and the study is there – it’s not just for show.’ And, given it’s defined as a concept car, the Cyber GTS is shown just as an exterior model and without any performance specifications. MG’s team say the fooprint hasn’t changed, although the GTS stands a little taller, implying that – if it were to make production – it would likely be offered with the Cyberster’s 335bhp single rear e-motor or the high-performance 503bhp twin-motor setup. Even so, MG also reminded us that it would be 60 years of the MGB GT in 2025, which would be an apt time to unveil a new coupe sports car.

23,Skoda's Elroq to get hotter with new vRS version,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/elroq/,Ted Welford,2025-03-28,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda is expanding its EV line-up with the new Elroq, and has just confirmed a vRS version. The new Elroq slots beneath the in its range and, at least for now before the Epiq arrives, is Skoda’s smallest EV. After the original reveal, Skoda has confirmed that a vRS version will launch on 3 April at Milan Fashion Week. We’ll find out more about the spicy new model next week but, for now, Skoda has previewed the new model with a teaser video in the brand’s Hyper Green colour scheme. Naturally, the vRS model will come with its own body kit, bespoke wheels that look very similar to those seen on the latest models and more power. Technical specifications aren’t confirmed yet, but the MEB platform is capable of more than 330bhp. Want to know more about the regular Elroq? Keep reading… Skoda first showed off its new ‘Modern Solid’ design language’ with its back in 2022, and the Elroq is its first car to carry that through to production. The front is particularly striking and different to everything else Skoda currently sells with no ‘grille’ as such but a closed frontal area with a new ‘four eyes’ light signature. The firm calls this its ‘Tech-Deck Face’ but acknowledges ‘familiar Skoda lines’, with the radar and cameras for the driver assistance hidden behind it, making the front end seem much tidier. The Elroq is also the first car with ‘SKODA’ lettering on both the bonnet and steering wheel. But for all the fancy new design at the front, the rear is surprisingly plain, looking just like a shrunken Enyaq. The Skoda Elroq is larger in all dimensions than the petrol and diesel-powered Karoq, which Skoda says it’s aiming to achieve ‘price parity’ with in many markets. In the UK, a 1.5-litre petrol Karoq is said to be within £200 of an entry-level Elroq when the two cars are on sale at the same time. It was initially thought the Elroq would replace the Karoq, which is now seven years into its lifecycle, but Skoda says changing market conditions mean the petrol car isn’t going anywhere for the time being. Plenty of interior space is a hallmark of just about every Skoda and the Elroq aims to be no different. The boot has a capacity of 470 litres, extending to 1580 litres with the rear seats folded. Skoda has introduced additional ‘Simply Clever’ features, including a storage net for a charging cable under the parcel shelf, which can also be used to divide the boot’s load area, and additional storage boxes for rear passengers where the transmission tunnel would usually be. Elsewhere in the interior, a large 13-inch touchscreen running Skoda’s latest software is included, with new shortcut buttons aiming to address previous shortcomings with the Enyaq. Choice is set to be key to the Elroq’s appeal, with a range of different battery sizes and electric motors available. Like the Enyaq, and other cars built around the MEB platform, the Elroq is rear-wheel-drive, with an all-wheel-drive model yet to be confirmed in the UK. Unveiling a new car in the public eye on a boat in front of Prague Castle is always going to be a bold strategy! New Škoda Elroq seems impressive. Range of up to 360 miles, very spacious and priced from £31,500 (for the smaller battery). Not sold on the front just yet, though… The ‘50’ model kicks off proceedings, using a 52kWh battery and 171bhp motor allowing for a 230-mile range. The mid-level Elroq is the 60, which is equipped with a 59kWh battery and more powerful 201bhp electric motor. The range from the 60 is ‘more than 250 miles’, according to Skoda, and is predicted to be the best-seller. At the top of the line-up is the 85 model, which features a 79kWh battery (the same as most Enyaqs), which enables a claimed electric range of 360 miles – a particularly impressive figure for an SUV of this size, though is slightly behind the 379-mile EV range of the . The 85 also uses a much more powerful 282bhp motor. The maximum charging speed of the Elroq depends on which version you go for, but regardless of battery size, it equates to the same 10 to 80 per cent charge in 25 minutes. Skoda is offering the Elroq in four trim levels – SE, SE L, Edition and SportLine – the latter being unusual for Skoda as it’s available straight after the launch. Prices start from an attractive £31,500 for the SE, which comes with part artificial leather upholstery, climate control, a reversing camera, blind spot monitoring and a 13-inch touchscreen. Upgrade to the SE L and this gains a heated seats and a heated steering wheel, paddles on the steering wheel to control the regenerative braking and satellite navigation, which is available from £33,250. The Edition is available from £34,450 and comes with large 19-inch alloy wheels and a dark chrome styling pack. Further features include adaptive cruise control, keyless entry and wirelsss phone charging. The flagship SportLine will predominantly be bought for its styling, with extras including 20-inch black wheels, a black styling pack and microsuede sports seats, though you also get an electric boot and sports suspension in the case of the 85 model. UK orders for the Elroq open on October 18, with first deliveries expected in March 2025. The Elroq forms part of a bold electric car offensive for Skoda. While it introduced the Enyaq back in 2024, there’s been somewhat of a lull ever since. That changes with the Elroq, which will be followed up with the – a city-aimed electric crossover that will serve as the twin to the Next up in 2025 is a heavy update for the Enyaq and its Coupe sibling, followed in 2026 by an as-yet-unnamed electric Skoda estate car and a large electric SUV of a similar size to the Kodiaq, which will be the production version of the Vision 7S concept car.

24,Håkan Samuelsson steps in to lead Volvo again after Jim Rowan resigns,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/hakan-samuelsson/,Jake Groves,2025-03-31,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo’s new CEO is actually its old one, as the brand parachutes in former boss Håkan Samuelsson to run the company after Jim Rowan’s surprise resignation. Samuelsson will serve a two-year term as president and CEO of Volvo Cars. Samuelsson had become part of the furniture at Volvo, serving on the Volvo Cars board from 2010, as well as being CEO from 2012 to 2022. His temporary new appointment is seen as an effort to ‘ensure stability’ at Volvo while the brand looks for a long-term successor. As well as his short time as CEO from now until 2027, it will be proposed that Samuelsson becomes a member of the Volvo Cars board once again. ‘Håkan led Volvo Cars through one of its most transformative and value-creating decades, revitalising the brand, expanding into new markets and successfully executing its IPO’ says Eric Li, chairman of the board. ‘We’re very pleased to welcome him back.’ As well as launching Volvo’s IPO, Samuelsson arguably led one of the largest developments of growth for the brand, introducing an entirely new family of successful cars like the and the 60 and 90 series, as well as the popular . He also led the brand to develop and engineer a range of plug-in hybrids arguably earlier than most brands. Rowan, who was the brand’s CEO from 2022, will step down on 31 March 2025. When he was appointed, he was seen as an outside choice, having led technology and electronics companies – but not cars. At the time, the appointment was seen as equally refreshing as it was risky, with Rowan leading the revitalisation of the brand with new all-electric models like the , and recently revealed . That said, Rowan’s tenure has seen mixed results for Volvo. While the brand has seen sales growth and success in some markets, the EX90 was dogged by production delays. While opening the brand up to a wider pool of customers, the EX30 has also been plagued with difficult-to-use user interface that arguably go against the Volvo brand’s message of safety and simplicity. Volvo has also had to row back from its plans to go electric-only – given the plateauing of demand for EVs in markets like Europe – and scale back its Care by Volvo subscription plan in some markets due to a lack of demand. Li added that Håkan’s appointment was because he had ‘a rare combination of industrial depth, strategic clarity and proven leadership,’ which almost seems like a slight at Rowan’s leadership. ‘I have deep respect for the challenges ahead and look forward to working with our talented team to sharpen our competitiveness and meet the demands of key markets, says Samuelsson upon his appointment. ‘It has been a pleasure to lead Volvo Cars,’ says Rowan. ‘Together we’ve made significant progress in building a fast-growing, trusted brand and launched some of the industry’s most advanced and safety-orientated products.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

25,Seat and Cupra boss Wayne Griffiths resigns,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/cupra/wayne-griffiths-ceo-resigns/,Ted Welford,2025-03-31,Car Magazine UK,"Seat and boss Wayne Griffiths has suddenly stepped down from the company after almost five years at the helm, according to a statement from the Spanish carmaker. In a statement, Seat said Griffiths had ‘decided to leave the company at his own request on March 31 to pursue new challenges.’ Manchester-born Griffiths became CEO of and Cupra in October 2020, taking the top job after leading the firms’ sales and marketing teams since 2016. Before then he held several executive positions at Audi. Volkswagen boss , who also serves as Seat and Cupra’s charman of the board, said: ‘Wayne Griffiths has done a great job in building the Cupra brand and restructuring the company. His understanding of the brand is remarkable. He is, in the best sense, a true car guy. We thank him for his excellent contribution and wish him all the best for the future.’ While launched in late 2018 as a standalone brand, Cupra came to fruition late in 2020 with the introduction of the coupe-crossover, launched at a similar time when Griffiths became CEO. Since then he has overseen the launch of the , and , with the firm gearing up to reveal the as a small electric hot hatchback at September’s Munich motor show. Seat as a whole has lead the development for the Volkswagen Group’s smallest EVs, including the , also due later this year. Griffiths’ shock departure comes just a few weeks after he made some interesting remarks when asked if he would continue in his position past 2030, when Cupra is planning to launch in the US, saying he was ‘all in’ until the end of his career. Speaking to journalists at Seat and Cupra’s annual media conference earlier in March, Griffiths said: ‘I’ve always said this company is my destiny, I’m all in until the end of my career. How much of that I can decide or how much of that is decided for me, you never know when you’re at the top of a company. ‘But for me personally, this is my dream job, I don’t have any other plans and as long as we’re successful and we deliver then we will continue and I’d love to be around when we launch the Cupra brand in the US. Less than that is making sure we make the decisions to make Cupra, Seat and this company successful in the next decade, that depends on me and that’s what I’m going to focus my attention on doing.’ Seat has confirmed that Markus Haupt, current production and logistics boss at the firm, will be taking over as interim leader while a successor is found. There is no word on whether Griffiths has accepted a new job, or if he is staying within the Volkswagen Group, which he has worked for since 1989.

26,Insteroid: the pumped-up Inster Hyundai built just because it could,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/insteroid-concept/,Jake Groves,2025-04-01,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai’s beefed up its cutesy city car to create this: the Insteroid. Described as a ‘bolder statement, harnessing unrestrained creativity to deepen the emotional connection with the Hyundai brand,’ it reimagines the perky new Inster electric car as some kind of raging muscle freak binging on energy drinks. It’s ‘pure fun’, according to Simon Loasby, senior vice president and head of Hyundai’s design centre, and it’s meant to really pull and stretch what Hyundai can create with such a small car. ‘The design presentation for this was probably the easiest of my career,’ Nicola Danza, exterior design manager for Hyundai Europe, tells CAR. ‘It was so cool from the first sketches that when they were shown to the CEO, he just said ‘build it’ and walked back out of the room.’ Hyundai has very clearly taken some inspiration from the , which effectively looked like a mutated, rally-spec Inster in itself. The Insteroid, though, is a ‘different beast’ according to Danza – not least because the Insteroid only moves slowly for manoeuvring. That said, the Insteroid still features an extremely wide track, super fat tyres with ‘track-optimised’ wheels and a rear wing so big you could do your ironing on it. Those enormous wheelarches feature integrated vents that release pressure in the wheel wells, too. All of this is exaggerated because the Insteroid has more than its fair share of design influence taken from gaming and the of today. ‘We need to think of the next generation, and we cannot be designing SUVs all the time – young people still want small cars’ says Danza. ‘We wanted to make this almost like a poster car for the kids.’ Inside, Hyundai’s designers are keen to point that it does still use the bare space of a regular Inster, but is almost race-spec. As well as a proper roll cage, bucket seats and a pared back design with a massive drift handbrake, the Insteroid comes with a ‘message grid’ that allows drivers to display messages when driving. The cockpit also features a ‘3D-knit’ fabric material made from recycled yarn. It also sounds like Hyundai’s nicked some of the RN24’s technology, too, as the Insteroid features a drift mode – perfect to go with that drift handbrake then. Hyundai’s not forgotten about sound either, saying the Insteroid ‘produces a unique sound, leaving an unforgettable impression.’ Various animations and graphics brighten up the wild cabin, and the Insteroid even features speakers directed outward so the car can be used as a massive roving audio platform. Of course, this is all just for show. Hyundai has no plans to make a wild Inster – at least one to this degree – and it is effectively a design study and one for the European design team to take the lead on. Even so, at least it proves that Hyundai still likes to do things for the hell of it. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

27,"Omoda 9 lands in the UK: £45k, 443bhp and ready to disrupt the SUV market",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/omoda/9/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-02,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Omoda 9, the second car from the brand to be released in the UK and its new flagship. Designed to sit well above the already released and E5 – with an Omoda 7 due later to fill the gap – the Omoda 9 is the culmination of the Chinese brand’s ethos. ‘[The 9] has to heighten that feeling of fashion and style, but also still stay core to that Omoda value of “value in everything”,’ said Oliver Lowe, product manager at Jaecoo and Omoda UK. ‘The Omoda 7 that’s coming in towards the end of the year sits perfectly between the Omoda 9 and the Omoda 5, in terms of not only its price positioning and the way it is styled – but also the value for money package that we’ll offer.’ The Omoda 9 looks just as safe and conservative as other products from the Chery Automobile group. Look at the pictures above and below and you’ll see a smart-looking SUV that’s inoffensive if not anonymous. Omoda says its designers have based the 9 on the golden ratio – but keener-eyed folk will detect a bit of Lexus and JLR in there, too… Like the before it, the Omoda 9 does its talking on the spec sheet, with a £44,990 asking price that’ll attract price-sensitive consumers from all over the place. ‘Historically, this isn’t a huge segment in terms of volumes,’ explains Lowe. ‘But we’re at a price point from the segment below.’ ‘We really think we’re going to be able to pull people from upper segments, people that are looking to reduce the price of their car – but also pull people who have been shopping for a C-segment SUV into this D- and E-segment SUV sizing.’ Omoda is after anyone’s business and has everything from second-hand Porsche Macan owners to Lexus RX buyers in its sights. ‘The F-Pace and Velar, we see as big competitors,’ Lowe continues. ‘We know that the fit and finish of the [Omoda 9] is really high, the material quality is really good and the features we’re offering are premium.’ ‘When they come to experience us, they won’t necessarily be expecting that from a car at that price point – or even a car coming from China, let’s be frank.’ In addition to safe looks and aggressive pricing, Omoda is banking on its ‘everything-as-standard,’ approach to seal the deal. Like the Jaecoo 7 before it, the Omoda 9 promises a decent quality packed with all the technology you’d expect from a premium car in 2025. Front and centre is a huge 24.6-inch panel with two screens, there’s a cooled wireless charging pad and ambient lighting. The Omoda 9 also comes equipped with a 14-speaker Sony surround system, as well as heated and ventilated seats in the front and rear. You also get a huge sunroof; 1.3 metres long in this case. The Omoda 9 will use a Super Hybrid System (SHS) more powerful than that in the Jaecoo 7. It comprises of a 1.5-litre engine, dual electric motors and a 34.46kWh battery. Altogether, it’s capable of pushing out 443bhp and 516lb ft of torque for a speedy 0-62mph sprint of just 4.9 seconds. But interestingly, that’s the only powertrain choice Omoda 9 buyers will get, and the reasons are three-fold: ‘We think that the drivetrain really fits the model concept,’ says Lowe. ‘The car is very dynamic, but it’s also very smooth and calm to drive.’ ‘In other markets it’s available in a 2.0-litre turbo, which doesn’t fit the UK market landscape in terms of customer demand,’ Lowe reveals. ‘And in terms of CO2, we want to be selling plug in hybrids where we can.’ Finally, the huge demand of the Jaecoo 7 SHS model above the other variants convinced Chery that the 9 should be offered in hybrid alone. Order books are open now, so customers can register their interest in one of the brand’s 73 dealers in the UK (100 are planned by the end of the year). Omoda is also offering a seven year/100,000 mile warranty with no milage limit for the first three years. There’ll also be an eight-year warranty on the battery. Deliveries begin in June.

28,Major car manufacturers fined £460m over forming car-recycling cartel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/recycling-scandal/,Ted Welford,2025-04-02,Car Magazine UK,"Fifteen leading car manufacturers have been fined a combined £460m for colluding and forming a ‘cartel’ to withhold car recycling information on their vehicles and reduce subsequent competition. Parallel investigations by the European Commission and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found key car makers such as Volkswagen, Stellantis and Jaguar Land Rover had formed a ‘cartel’ and ‘illegally agreed’ not to advertise if their cars went above the minimum recycling requirement of 85 per cent. Other firms involved include BMW, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan/Renault and Toyota. Similarly, the three-year investigation found carmakers (except for Renault) worked together to not share the percentage of material that could be recycled, recovered or reused in their new cars, meaning there was no competition between them. It’s a practice the European Commission and CMA deem illegal because customers were unable to compare the green credentials of the cars they were buying, which could have persuaded their buying decision. Most manufacturers took part in this ‘cartel’ between May 2002 and September 2017, with Jaguar Land Rover joining in September 2008. Automotive trade bodies, the Society of Motor  Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) have also been fined for helping to facilitate this illegal car recycling activity, including chairing meetings and intervening when manufacturers had acted outside the agreed terms of the group. Elsewhere, eight manufacturers, including BMW, Ford and Toyota, have also been fined for what the investigations refers to as a ‘buyers’ cartel’, whereby they agreed between themselves not to pay external companies to handle the end-of-life vehicle recycling, believing they could profit from dismantling their cars. It’s a service that carmakers must offer customers for recycling their old or written-off vehicles, and meant that companies providing this service on behalf of car makers were unable to negotiate at all with the car manufacturers. Mercedes, while involved in the illegal cartel, has managed to avoid fines altogether as it exposed the group to the Commission and CMA’s investigation and therefore escapes penalty as part of the authorities’ ‘leniency policy’. A reduction in fines was also granted to Stellantis, Mitsubishi and the SMMT for approaching the CMA for leniency during the investigation and for their cooperation. In total, manufacturers were fined €458 (£383m) by the European Commission and £78m by the CMA. Volkswagen faces the largest financial penalty, with a fine of €107m (£89m) imposed by the Commission and £15m by the CMA. In a statement, a Volkswagen Group spokesperson said: “Volkswagen Group UK (VWG) notes today’s decision of the UK Competition and Markets Authority. VWG has cooperated fully with the CMA throughout its investigation and remains committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance.” Renault and Nissan also face huge fines of €81m (£68m) and £10m respectively, Ford’s fine of £19m was the largest imposed by the CMA in the UK. All manufacturers and trade bodies have now agreed to pay the CMA the fines, with all funds required to be paid by June 2. Though the European Commission and CMA’s investigations ran in parallel, firms such as Honda, Hyundai and Kia, Mazda, Suzuki and Volvo only face EU fines and not in the UK.

The brand has unveiled its facelifted car at the 2025 Seoul Mobility Show, showing a simpler and meaner design. ‘Honestly? We look at this and think: why didn’t we do this design in the first place [over the outgoing Ioniq 6]?’ says Simon Loasby, senior vice president and head of Hyundai’s design centre. ‘Time helps you sometimes, and sometimes you carry baggage.’ Anyway, we weren’t kidding about the 6’s increased sleekness. The design has been given a general de-creasing, with fewer cuts and bulges down the sides and on the rear end. The car is also a bit frownier, with shallow new headlights inspired by those seen on the . It’s all in the aim of adding a little simplicity to a car that was rather busy to look at. ‘Some of the best products in the world are simple,’ Loasby tells CAR. ‘We talked to our aerodynamics guys and we asked how we could simplify the rear spoiler.’ The end result was a cleaner tailgate arrangement with a bigger single ducktail spoiler. ‘And who doesn’t like a big ducktail?’ asks Loasby. Launching with the facelift is the new N Line spec, coloured in red. The bumpers are more aggressive front and back, and there are bespoke wheel designs. So, as well as being sleeker and simpler, Hyundai’s made the Ioniq 6 angrier – and more like cars like the and Sonata available in markets besides Europe. The same level of nip/tuck-ness that’s been applied to the exterior continues inside. Hyundai says the cockpit still feels quite cocooning, with a new steering wheel and a tidier dashboard layout. Oh, and . We knew that already, given we’ve , but this is the first time the brand has confirmed it. And… that’s about it. Performance specs, for example, haven’t been confirmed yet – but the line-up (beyond the addition of the N Line model) is unlikely to change too much from the outgoing model.

30,Genesis X Gran Coupe and Convertible concepts are for Malibu elite,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/x-gran-coupe-convertible/,Jake Groves,2025-04-03,Car Magazine UK,"Genesis is twisting and stretching its into new shapes, resulting in these two new concepts: the X Gran Coupe and X Gran Convertible. The two concept cars have made their public debut at the 2025 Seoul Mobility Show. If you’re thinking like us, this feels like yet another new concept car from a brand that’s starting to feel like it needs some new production cars instead. Genesis knows this, and promises the next decade will bring some. ‘In the 10 years since our launch, Genesis has been dedicated to delivering its unique values to more than 1.3 million customers worldwide,” says head of Genesis, Mike Song. ‘We aim to seize this opportunity as a launchpad for a new decade, showcasing models that embody Genesis’ pursuit of high-performance technology and future luxury design.’ The X Gran Coupe and Convertible, then, are very Ronseal: one is a grandiose two-door coupe, while the other is a glamorous convertible. Both are finished in some pretty wild colour schemes inside and out, feature four full seats and come with some enormous wheels. Genesis says the interior of the Coupe is inspired by Mediterranean olives, with olive wood used in the dashboard, and an upholstery palette that wouldn’t look out of place on an antipasti board. The Convertible, meanwhile, is inspired by the deep hues of red wine. And, despite these being concept cars, they look remarkably ready for production. Whether that’ll actually happen, though, doesn’t seem likely. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

31,All-new NEXO proves Hyundai’s not giving up on hydrogen,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/nexo/,Jake Groves,2025-04-03,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has just unveiled its all-new NEXO hydrogen fuel cell car at the 2025 Seoul Mobility Show. The new SUV features a wild and radical design that looks like someone has reinvigorated the Pontiac Aztek – and almost entirely copies that of revealed in November 2024. This is Hyundai’s second generation NEXO model, and its third-generation hydrogen fuel cell production car after the ix35 Fuel Cell model. And, while certain other brands either turn their back on hydrogen or give it the cold shoulder (like Toyota, which now seems to be focusing more on HGVs for hydrogen fuel cell use), this shows Hyundai is committing to the fuel type. The look is based on Hyundai’s ‘Art of Steel’ design philosophy, with the brand saying that such an ethos shows ‘the resilience and versatility of steel deliver tension and strength, with the resulting shapes a form of art.’ It’s definitely a bold design, with quite boxy and deliberate details and a particularly interesting C-pillar – and entirely different compared to . The new NEXO is longer, wider and taller than the outgoing model, with Hyundai claiming a chunky 993 litres of total luggage volume – which, we presume, includes the seats being folded down. The interior feels familiarly Hyundai given recent model reveals, with tech like generative AI in the infotainment’s voice assistant, vehicle to load technology and a specific fuel cell route planner in the nav that maps fuelling stations. Echoing trends in the car industry, Hyundai’s also included a huge head-up display that reacts to data in the road. It’s a proper production car with specs and everything, too. It’s longer than a but shorter than a . The hydrogen fuel cell power plant consists of 162 litres of storage for hydrogen fuel, a 2.64kWh battery pack and a 201bhp electric motor driving the front wheels. That makes the NEXO capable of a 7.8sec 0-62mph sprint and will top out at 111mph. As for driving range, Hyundai is targeting a max of 435 miles from full to zero. Naturally, the debate as to how useful hydrogen fuel cells are remains a strong one. Hyundai’s efforts to create a new-generation NEXO is part of a wider plan to offer a various powertrains for all uses, with the brand saying it ‘continues to expand FCEV infrastructure.’  Even so, there is a quiet acknowledgement that the NEXO will remain a niche for private buyers, and will likely be offered to fleets and businesses that can use the infrastructure around them. Hyundai confirms the new Nexo will go on sale towards the end of 2025, and will launch in Europe in 2026. For the UK, Hyundai aims to sell the NEXO at a similar price to the outgoing one – around £65k. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

32,Electric Skoda Elroq vRS is the brand's fastest car yet,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/elroq-vrs/,Graham King,2025-04-03,Car Magazine UK,"There was a time when it would seem ridiculous that the fastest thing in a car manufacturer’s range would be a mid-size SUV, but such is the world electrification has created. Case in point: the newly revealed electric Skoda Elroq vRS is the fastest production Skoda ever, whipping from 0-62mph in just 5.4 seconds. For comparison, the latest Octavia vRS takes a leisurely 6.4 seconds. It’s to be expected. Mid-size electric SUVs are rapidly becoming the default option for many car buyers, some of whom still want a sporty looking car with a rapid turn of pace. Given Skoda’s habit of vRS-ing most of its cars, it was inevitable the really rather good Elroq would receive the treatment. Two electric motors power the Elroq vRS – one each for the front and rear wheels. Together they produce 335bhp and an unspecified, probably fairly significant amount of torque. That 5.4 second 0-62mph time is the result; top speed is 111mph. The chassis is suitably uprated to cope with the extra power. The car sits on sports suspension that’s 15mm lower at the front and 10mm lower at the rear. The steering is retuned as well, and the drive modes include a traction mode that takes advantage of the all-wheel drive set up. DCC adaptive suspension is available as an option. With it, the standard driving modes are reconfigured for “even better comfort,” says Skoda, and individual mode allows the driver to cycle through 15 damper configurations. The Elroq vRS is perhaps the most pugnacious looking sporty Skoda since the first Fabia vRS – the diesel one. It’s made distinct from other Elroqs by deeper front and rear bumpers, a prominent rear spoiler, black trim details and vRS badges on the front wings. The grille – which Skoda calls Tech-Deck Face because it houses a load of sensors – is illuminated and puts on a lightshow when the car is locked and unlocked. Various vRS-specific wheel designs up to 21in in size are available. Inside, the seats are covered in Suedia microfibre cloth and the steering wheel in perforated leather, both with lime green stitching. Carbonfibre-effect trim adorns the dashboard and doors and there are aluminium pedals. Standard features include a 5in digital cockpit and 13in infotainment display, electrically adjustable massaging driver’s seat with memory, Canton stereo and wireless phone charging. Matrix LED headlights are also standard and there’s the usual phalanx of driver assists including adaptive cruise control and lane assist, traffic jam assist and blind spot detection. There’s even remote park assist, which allows the driver to park the car while stood next to it, via the MySkoda app. The system can even learn up to five parking scenarios and automatically drive itself into position. The vRS has the biggest battery in the Elroq range, with a capacity of 84kWh (79kWh usable). Skoda states a range of 340 miles on the WLTP cycle, 20 miles down on the regular Elroq 85. The vRS can recharge at a rate of 185kW, at which a 10 to 80% charge is possible in 26 minutes. Using an 11kW AC charger, getting from 0 to 100% takes eight hours. Exact UK specifications and pricing will be announced later in April. Deliveries are expected to start in summer 2025.

33,Ineos vs the world,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ineos/biomass/,Colin Overland,2025-04-03,Car Magazine UK,"► Its cars may be highly traditional, but the way Ineos Automotive operates doesn’t conform to the habits of longer-established car makers. Outspoken CEO Lynn Calder isn’t afraid to call out politicians for their flip-flopping on electrification and is critical of other car makers for trying to railroad customers into cars they don’t want. And now she’s hit out at the EU’s response to US President Donald Trump’s plans for import tariffs. The company, owned by petrochemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, said in a statement: ‘We are outraged that the tariff situation with the US has been neglected by the EU. President Trump has been very clear on his intention to implement tariffs on the auto industry. He has been asking for fairness and reciprocity and yet European leaders have not come to the table to negotiate a better solution. ‘The US government has also been clear about the consequences of non-engagement. This should be a surprise to no one in the EU, and it could and should have been averted.’ Cars built in the EU and sold in the US will be hit with a 25 per cent tariff, due to start on 2 April. The and Quartermaster pick-up are built at Hambach in France, a former Mercedes factory. Calder added: ‘This is what happens when politicians sit on their hands. As a growing EU-based automobile brand, we are vulnerable to tariffs, and we need our politicians to support our business, our jobs and our economies. We need urgent and direct political intervention on tariffs. ‘We will give whatever support we can to our political leaders to keep the playing field even for small, competitive brands such as Grenadier. But we must see action from EU politicians: only they are in a position to address the issue. Fortunately, we have been planning for tariffs but there is only so much we can do to protect US customers from price rises.’ Half its sales last year were in the US, and Ineos has high hopes of significantly increasing that in 2025 as it opens more retailers across the nation. It’s now in more than 50 countries, with Mexico and China among them, so its eggs are in many baskets, but the US is too big a deal in the off-road world to surrender lightly. She’s also unhappy with the EU, and various other politicians, for their lack of clarity and consistency on ways to reduce harmful emissions. Having revealed the look of the Fusilier – a smaller, more modern-looking 4×4, with a choice of electric or range-extender powertrain – last year, Ineos has now put that on the back burner. ‘There are some discussions going on in the EU about what exactly will be banned. We don’t want to spend any more money until we know what the landscape looks like. I’m hopeful. But at the moment we’re going to concentrate on the platform that we’ve actually built. There’s so much we can do with that.’ The Grenadier, currently offered only with non-electrified diesel and petrol sixes, will in a couple of years evolve to mild-hybrid powertrains from BMW. But the long-term future is unclear, with sales of new hybrids as well as pure-combustion cars currently set to be banned within a decade. ‘If we can’t get that clarity, then we’ve got other markets. I don’t want that to be the case. UK, Germany, France, Austria – these are our heartland countries for a British company with Austrian and German engineering and components, manufactured in France – how sad to be not be bringing our cars into those markets. That’s not the plan. But we would really like governments to recognise that what they might like ideologically is not happening. Tell us where you want to get to from a future emissions reduction perspective and let us – the whole industry – come with a menu of options to get to that CO2 level.’ She added: ‘My other complaint is that they just seem to think they can make these decisions at the last minute and the automotive industry can just click their fingers. As agile as we’ve said we are, it doesn’t really work that way.’ In a jibe at other car makers, who were having to reintroduce combustion engines to meet demand from EV-averse buyers, she said: ‘What we’re seeing at the moment is what happens when you forget that if people don’t want something you can’t force it on them.’ Two years ago, Ineos showed a prototype hydrogen fuel cell version of the Grenadier, but that has also been put on pause, as the number of hydrogen filling opportunities in the UK and elsewhere has started to reduce. Although the Ineos group of companies is involved in hydrogen, Ineos Automotive can’t currently see it becoming an option for car drivers. For all her frustration with politicians, Calder remains committed to net zero as a target. That’s why Ineos has invested €15m in a biomass plant at the Hambach factory. It will take care of 78 per cent of the giant plant’s heating, and in so doing reduce the CO2 emissions by 8800 tonnes.It uses local woodchips – up to 14,000 tonnes a year, sustainably sourced. The chips are burnt in two boilers, connected to a heat pump. Waste ash, with a high nitrate content, will be used as fertilisers by local farmers.

The show acts as a trade expo for all things automotive, technology and mobility with (naturally) Hyundai Group being front and centre. Of course, a pretty sizeable amount of the floor space is taken up by Hyundai Group. As well as the car brands Hyundai, Kia and Genesis all featuring the biggest stands at the expo, Hyundai’s heavy machinery also had its own spot. That then leads to tuners attending the show with their own versions. A particular highlight was CN Motors, which transforms cars like the Kia Carnival MPV and (more relevantly for Europe) the Hyundai Santa Fe into super taxis with lounging recliners in the second row and wood floors. Plenty of 21 century themes were being explored, too, with guests being able to talk to AI assistants and even spot Boston Dynamics’ robots wandering around. Both, in my view, have a slightly off-putting Uncanny Valley feeling when interacting with them, though. Keep reading for our quick debrief of the most important new cars at this year’s show. As BYD’s reach extends out of China, it’s installing a presence in other countries. Nothing new was really revealed, but the show featured its latest Seal models as well as the and U9 supercar. A double-whammy of near-production concept cars that gave Genesis’ design team the change to play around with the shape and structure of the brand’s large G90 executive saloon. Eye-popping colour combos have been inspired by Mediterranean olives and cabernet sauvignon. A sleeker and less busy design for Hyundai’s ‘streamliner’ EV, which senior vice president and Hyundai design centre boss says is the ‘one we should have done.’ The new look is distilled and neater, and makes a different use of that ducktail rear end. An N-Line spec also launches. Not physically at the show, but the first official confirmation that it’s coming was right here. The new 6 N will be officially unveiled at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, benefiting from the same performance engineering as the 5 N. Expect a widebody stance, optional rear wing choices and the potential for loads of smiles. An Inster that’s been injected with all sorts and is designed to be ‘a poster car’ for the of today. Over-exaggerated details include an enormous front splitter and a rear wing so big you can do your ironing on it. It’s just a bit of fun for Hyundai’s European design team, so don’t expect some Inster N interpretation anytime soon. Hyundai is committing to the hydrogen passenger car, even if other brands go quiet on developing the FCEVs of the next generation. Technically, this NEXO is the first production car with inspiration from the Vision N 74, and debuts Hyundai’s new ‘Art of Steel’ design language that’ll be on future cars, too. The home launch of the brand’s push into commercial vehicles and family-friendly minibuses. We’ve already seen the new PV5 a few times, launching as an electric van and MPV that Kia says is very flexible. Mini has a reasonable presence in Korea, given the kitch-ness of its design and the fact its cars are smaller than most others in the market – perfect for younger Seoul dwellers. Here, the latest John Cooper Works models launched. Given the high-end clientele in Korea that love to be chauffeured around sprawling Seoul, the ultra-luxe Merc sub-brand was out in force with its wares. A Korean market launch for the updated G, with a stand almost entirely dedicated to the launch of the latest model. Both and were on show, with a cool demo stand of a G-Class covered in mud… on one side. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

35,Thor's hammer: Zenvo's new 1850bhp V12 road-car engine is ready for action,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/zenvo/aurora/,"Piers Ward,",2025-04-04,Car Magazine UK,"The first of Zenvo’s new 6.6-litre V12 engines has been hand assembled and will shortly commence testing. The bespoke V12, which the Danish company calls ‘Mjølner’ – yes, as in Thor’s hammer – will form the heart of the new Zenvo Aurora supercar range. The firm also just happens to claim it will be the most powerful V12 ever fitted to a road car, with the top spec version promising a mammoth 1850bhp. Wondering how on earth that can possibly work in a road car? Well, keep reading for full details of both Aurora variants and extensive interview highlights from Zenvo’s key personnel. You probably won’t be surprised to learn that the V12 doesn’t make all that power all by itself. Developed with Mahle Powertrain based in Northampton – F1-central in the UK – it is, however, a dedicated road-going design, deliberately avoiding what Zenvo calls the ‘compromises’ of being motorsport derived. The engine concept is modular – meaning V6 and V8 variants could be developed over time – but most importantly it has future-gazing legislation requirements firmly in mind. Using the Mahle Jet Ignition system, it will meet proposed Euro7 emission standards, for example. Given the costs involved in creating its own powerplant from the ground up like this, Zenvo is expecting to get at least a couple of decades out of its investment. The results so far are a planned 9,800rpm redline and 1250bhp from the engine alone, which inhales air via four turbochargers. That’s already quite a silly number, but even the most basic (absolutely not the right word) rear-wheel drive application announced so far will include a 200bhp electric motor as part of a hybrid system – meaning minimum output in the Aurora of 1450bhp. The 1850bhp version will gain two additional electric motors, one for each of the front wheels. And this is actually for the more road-friendly model. Mahle Powertrain has been working on its Jet Ignition concept for over a decade. In very simple terms, it replaces the conventional sparkplug with a pre-chamber ignition assembly. While this adds more complexity, it also allows for a faster and more precise ignition process inside the main combustion chamber – without resorting to a second igniter. This enables a significantly extended knock limit, higher compression ratios, increased performance and ‘ultra-lean’ running. Once the mixture is initially ignited in the pre-chamber – which does use a conventional spark plug – the partially combusted result is then jetted into the main combustion chamber via a number of small ‘orifices’ to ignite the main charge. The performance and efficiency improvements come from the way the jets of hot gas are able to penetrate deeper into the combustion chamber. And because there are between four and eight jets, depending on the application, main ignition takes place at multiple sites, ‘resulting in rapid and stable combustion’. Conventional port and direct injection can be used, while Passive and Active variants enable the application exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) or a secondary low-flow direct injection system in the pre-chamber, respectively. The latter is again more complicated but also allows for ultra-lean burn with stability and even greater efficiency. Mahle’s tech demonstrations so far have shown brake thermal efficiency (BTE – the ratio between the power output of the engine and the energy in the fuel consumed) of over 40 per cent, with a future target of over 45 per cent. A conventional petrol engine typically has a BTE of 20-30 per cent. The result is the promise of ‘diesel-like’ efficiency and substantially reduced CO2 emissions. In the ultra-lean phase, NOx emissions have been shown to fall by 99 per cent. If the proves nothing else, it’s that there’s no limit to the number of hypercars the world can sustain. Pagani, GMA, Koenigsegg and Czinger are the relative newbies; Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Lotus and Bugatti the legacy brands they all aspire to. Danish manufacturer Zenvo also wants to join the fun, hosting the European debut of its new Zenvo Aurora at the 2024 Festival, following its initial unveiling at The Quail during the 2023 . But chairman and chief commercial officer, Jens Sverdrup, is aware of the scale facing it in terms of those rivals. ‘People are buying our car now. We have good customers, respectable people. But the customers we don’t have are the brand guys, the ones who buy Bugattis and others on the strength of the brand. We have car guys. They’re buying the car and the technology and the engineering. ‘I always say the Aurora is €2.6 million [around £2.2m]. It’s actually a €3.6 million [around £3m] car but we’re not charging for the brand. If you’re Aston Martin or similar, you can easily charge a million extra. This [the Aurora] is no less of a product, no smaller a programme than the .’ The Aurora will be available in two flavours when it launches in late 2026 – the Agil for track use and the Tur for touring. And although both do without the preceding ’s mad rear wing, both still have aero at their heart. The Agil in particular looks as if the wind tunnel development work was at the heart of the design process. Sverdrup told us that ‘we use aero going through the car rather than over it. It’s based on functionalism. Every part has a purpose and we’ve used the carbon fibre monocoque as part of the design.’ The Agil is a striking car in the flesh, with enough scoops and hollowed out sections to rival F1 cars at their most extreme. The Tur is more conventional, but by turning the quad-turbo, 6.6-litre V12 hybrid up to 11, it gets more power than the Agil at 1850bhp. This in a car with a claimed dry weight of less than 1450kg. Zenvo has had to box clever with both in order to make the project feasible. Modularity is key, from the chassis to the engines. ‘They’re my babies. At the base of it was this idea of modularity, a modular platform so we can do many more models out of the platform, such as a junior hypercar, because it’s all carbon subframes. ‘Even the engines are [modular]. We are able to make V8s and V6s from the V12 because no matter how you spin it, it’s crazy crazy money to develop a V12 for a small company like ours. We have to make this last for another 20 years, at least.’ It’s a sensible strategy, as you might expect from the sensible Danes. Even the clients’ deposits go into an Escrow account so Zenvo can’t burn them on current R&D spend. Sverdrup admits it’s a tightrope at times, but he seems to have a clear-eyed vision as to how to ensure Zenvo doesn’t become another automotive vapourware project. He has the experience and the right team around him – Sverdrup himself has worked at similar brands like Czinger, BAC and Koenigsegg while Jon Gunner, ex of Aston Martin Q, is now on board as CTO – to hopefully ensure it’s a success. More choice for more billionaires. Not quite, according to Zenvo’s head of design, Christian Brandt. At The Quail he told us: ‘when we talked to clients and asked them if they would be interested in an electric hypercar, the answer was a very definitive ‘no.’ And so we asked them whether they’d like a V6, V8 or V12, something like 90 per cent of them said V12.’ And what a V12 it is. The Aurora’s 6.6-litre 12-cylinder engine has been developed by MAHLE Powertrain and includes four turbochargers. As for power, Zenvo says it produces 1250bhp on its own and (good news, eco-conscious billionaires) it’s even Euro7-compliant. On top of that, the Aurora features a 200bhp e-motor on the rear axle, meaning a total of 1450bhp is available. That powertrain configuration is for the Agil version (pictured in red) – the more hardcore, lightweight and track-ready variant of the Aurora. However, the new supercar also features a Tur (Danish for ‘Touring’) model pictured in blue, which includes two more e-motors driving power to each of the front wheels for a total system power of 1850bhp. Zenvo says the Agil model is capable of a 0-62mph sprint in around 2.5sec and 0-125mph is possible in around 4.6 sec, as is a top speed of 227bhp. As for the Tur, that additional e-grunt means a 0-62mph sprint is possible in around 2.3sec and Zenvo even says it can manage 0-248mph in 17sec, topping out at an estimated 280mph. That would make the Zenvo Aurora among the fastest cars in the world. And those eye-popping performance numbers are backed up by some serious engineering. The Aurora uses pushrod front and rear double wishbone suspension, active aerodynamics (including an air brake on the Agil model), an electronic differential, carbon ceramic brakes and 20/21-inch front/rear magnesium centre-lock wheels. Just 50 of each specification will be made. With some difficulty, and a hell of a lot of digital systems, according to Brandt. ‘It was definitely a challenge. We realised that there was a reason why a Formula One car looks the way it does, or the way a Le Mans car looks the way it does,’ he says. ‘But we identified a number of design cues that we recognised as Zenvo design DNA, and we were fighting to keep those elements visible or intact in the design and seeing if the aero guys could make it work.’ Brandt adds that he and the design team tried as hard as they could to stay away from what he describes as ‘monolithic’ car design in which aerodynamic details are simply bolted onto a basic shape: ‘as a designer from Denmark, you’re constantly beaten with the phrase ‘form follows function,’ so that was the deal basically – to see if we could create a car that was aerodynamically performing. ‘When the [Aston Martin] came out, their approach of doing all of the underbody aero flowing around the car – that was a huge inspiration for us,’ says Brandt, ‘and when it comes to the exterior design of the car, we actually started to look a little outside of the car sector looking at things like high-speed motorbikes, or track day cars like or – that sort of deconstructed approach to the hypercar.’ Naturally all of that focus on aerodynamic efficiency has meant some serious stats have been spat out of all of the digital software helping to create the Aurora. ‘The data is still in the computer, and it’s before we get the real car on the road and start doing testing, but the numbers say it creates up to 880kg of downforce at 250km/h (155mph), which is around 100kg more than the does at the same speed. And that’s with a drag coefficient that’s even less than the Senna.’ Not really, no. Extensive use of carbonfibre means the Agil model has a dry weight of less than 1300kg, with the tri-motor Tur model clocking in at less than 1450kg. So much work has been put into developing the carbonfibre structure that Zenvo plans on using it to its fullest. ‘You could argue that the most expensive parts of the development were the monocoque and the engine,’ says Brandt. ‘Being a small manufacturer, we can’t just trash that in six years time or something – we’ve developed in a modular way where we can use it again for future projects.’ ‘Well we have talked about doing a junior hypercar,’ says Brandt, ‘which is our vision for the next car. Higher volume, lower price, that kind of thing. ‘And then there’s the question of the powertrain. We say people want engines now, but you can see there are movements in the industry towards electric so that may change. But overall, my hope and my future fight is to make sure Zenvo doesn’t turn into a company that all of a sudden starts making an electric SUV, for example! Especially for special cars of this class, I still think there’s a future for the combustion engine.’ CAR magazine's deputy editor has a penchant for automotive adventure and trading in quirky, often-unreliable old cars.

36,UK government softens ZEV mandate in response to Trump tariffs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/zev-mandate/,Ryan Gilmore,2025-04-07,Car Magazine UK,"The government has relaxed details in the Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) mandate in response to US president Donald Trump’s swingeing tariffs on car makers – meaning that manufacturers have more leeway in the switchover to electric vehicles. It means that car makers are less likely to face fines for non-compliance and there’s more wriggle room for them to balance the delivery of electric vehicles in different years to avoid fines. The fine for non-compliance is reduced from £15,000 to £12,000 and the government is pledging to invest £2.3 billion towards ‘tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure,’ according to prime minister Keir Starmer. The key changes to the ZEV mandate announced overnight are: Starmer added: ‘ Today I am announcing bold changes to the way we support our car industry. This will help ensure home-grown firms can export British cars built by British workers around the world and the industry can look forward with confidence, as well as back with pride. And it will boost growth that puts money in working people’s pockets, the first priority of our Plan for Change.’ The British government has watered down the ZEV mandate after a public consultation – and it comes just days after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all cars sold in the US that are not made there. ‘The government has rightly listened to industry and recognised the intense pressure manufacturers are under. Industry remains committed to decarbonising road transport but the ZEV mandate targets are incredibly challenging, especially with a paucity of consumer demand and geopolitical upheaval. Growing EV demand to the levels needed still requires equally bold fiscal incentives, however, to give motorists full confidence to switch. We await full details of the regulatory amendments but, given the potentially severe headwinds facing manufacturers following the introduction of US tariffs, greater action will almost certainly be needed to safeguard our industry’s competitiveness. UK-US negotiations must continue at pace, while the long-awaited industrial and trade strategies should prioritise automotive and be delivered at speed.’ ‘The good news is that the government has listened and made material changes. There has been a general recognition that existing targets were proving unrealistic and a relaxation was needed that accounted for real world market conditions. Moves such as allowing hybrid cars and diesel vans to stay on sale until 2035 will provide a degree of breathing space for manufacturers, as will the greater flexibility around production caps and car and van credits. Notably, it does feel as though the particular difficulties the new electric van market is facing have been recognised. Overall, we’re giving these moves a cautious welcome.’ The mandate was introduced in 2024 and set a pathway to full electrification of all new car sales in the UK. The ZEV mandate was designed to increase incrementally each year, with a 22% target for 2024, rising to 28% in 2025. The ramifications of the ZEV mandate are already being felt. It was cited by Stellantis as a reason for announcing and by Ford for cutting 800 jobs in the UK. Nissan is the latest in a long line of manufacturers calling for urgent support from the government. Guillaume Cartier, chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said ‘the Mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment.’ The criteria is simple, according to government definitions: a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) produces 0g/km of CO2 and has at least 120 miles of range, according to the WLTP test cycle. So that broadly means EVs, as they make up most of the market here, but hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like the also count.

37,Brit-designed concept imagines Corvette as fan-assisted electric hypercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/chevrolet/corvette-hypercar-concept/,Jake Groves,2025-04-07,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at an electric hypercar Corvette. Not only that; you’re looking at one that’s had all of its design done in the UK – not the States. You might recognise the name of the designer leading the UK-based team on the project: Julian Thomson, the designer of the original Lotus Elise, and whom spent several years at Jaguar Land Rover working with Ian Callum. Thomson and his UK team are based at GM’s new Advanced Design Centre in Leamington Spa. ‘We talk about brand experts here with , but when I did the Elise, we didn’t have brand experts,’ says Thomson. ‘We went back to basics and the legacy, and about what that company should be about. That’s what we do with design all the time – we’re thinking about what really is the essence of what the brand is and how we can take it forward into the future.’ While this car, we’re told, isn’t actually the next-generation Corvette, Thomson says: ‘there’s no doubt that Corvette is strong enough to do other things that stretch the brand.’ This Corvette concept is one of a series of design studies being created by GM Design teams all around the world. ‘As part of the Corvette creative study, we asked multiple studios to develop hypercar concepts, which we’ll see more of later this year,’ says GM Design head, Michael Simcoe. Explaining the reasoning for creating these concepts, Thomson adds: ‘it comes down to this thing about when you buy an exotic sports car – you want to be part of the tribe, and you want to know what’s going on. You want confidence in the car you’re buying that it’s good, and that the brand is going to get even better in the future.’ So, what’s special about this one, then? Well, on first glance, it doesn’t look that much like a conventional Corvette – but then you see some of the details. The split window, which is named Apex Vision, is a nod to the Corvette Stingray from the 60s and acts as a spine for the whole car. While the Corvette concept has been shaped using both digital tools and clay modelling, the vision is for such a car to be crafted using 3D printing – also known as additive manufacturing. The whole structure of the car is built in such a way, with the bodywork having also been designed to reduce the amount of panels. There are some techy specs, too. As well as race-spec pushrod suspension, this Corvette concept car is fan-assisted, helping to improve aero and keep the car glued to the road while travelling at high speeds. The flowing underbody is nicknamed Aero-Duality. We’ll see more concepts sprout from GM’s global design teams in the months to come.

38,Blackwall and Silvertown tunnel charges: London's latest vehicle charge is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/blackwall-silvertown-tunnel-charge/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-07,Car Magazine UK,"► The Blackwall tunnel is no longer free. From 7 April 2025, Transport for London has introduced new charges for the Blackwall tunnel and the newly-opened Silvertown tunnel. TFL says the new setup should improve air quality and ease congestions, but could also affect motorists commuting from South London more than others. The new charges come as part of a raft of changes made by TfL to better manage traffic around the the Thames crossing. The most significant is the opening of the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will also be able support bus services for easier, quicker cross-river traffic. The charges can be seen in the table below, but eagle-eyed viewers will notice when the peak times are and the directions they apply to. Significantly, peak times apply only to those travelling northbound in the morning before the working day, and southbound after the working day. That could mean a daily charge of £8 for vehicles south of the river who need to commute to the north, compared with a total charge of £3 for those doing the opposite journey. What’s more, these charges apply in addition to the congestion charge (for which EVs are exempt), meaning a trip into London could cost at least £23 for some ICE cars – and that’s assuming you’re in a ULEZ-compliant car. To pay for the new charge, you’ll need to visit the – though as you’d expect the TfL website is unable to handle the surge of new traffic, so it’s not working at the time of writing. Ironic, but somewhat predictable. TfL will charge you peak prices at all charging times for paying on your phone or online – but you get off-peak prices if you sign up to its Auto Pay service.  The TfL says if you drive through either tunnel during charging times, you will have until midnight on the third day after your journey to pay. Generous. The TfL is at least allowing discounts to selected residents and providing they meet certain conditions, they could be eligible for a 50 per cent discount. These discounts should apply for at least three years after the tunnel’s opening. You can find a list of which residents could be . For South Londoners, the M25 or the Rotherhithe or Limehouse Link tunnel may now be the cheapest, fastest ways to head north. The latter two tunnels are free, and the Dartford Crossing remains free for motorcycle and is just £2.50 for cars – but it’s even cheaper if you pre-pay. What do you think of the new charges?

39,Bargain Bentley? Expanded Continental GT range makes do with mere 671bhp hybrid,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bentley/continental-gt/,Jake Groves,2025-04-08,Car Magazine UK,"Bentley is boosting its and range with the introduction of a second hybrid powertrain and two new model variants. The new High Performance Hybrid system arrives as the entry-point to both ranges, joining the line-up below the Ultra Performance Hybrid that launched in the GT Speed to much acclaim in 2024. Entry-level is always a relative term, and in this case you’re hardly likely to feel shortchanged. Not only do the new still promise up to 53 miles of driving range, they’re also paired with the firm’s same melliferous 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8. And even in detuned state this results in a combined 671bhp and 686lb ft. Meanwhile, the addition of ‘core’ and Azure specifications mean buyers are no longer limited to the Speed (slightly gauche?) and Mulliner (jolly pricey, what?) variants that have exclusively made up the selection since the introduction of the fourth-generation Continental GT. All of which means the Bentley Continental is now more affordable. Sort of. That’s an excellent question – because even though opting for a new High Performance Hybrid will save you in the region of £35,000, once you’ve got stuck into the notoriously indulgent customisation options you’re never going to get out of the showroom without something of a financial hangover. Although perhaps if it’s a choice between getting to 62mph 0.5sec faster or adding on the Naim hi-fi (or whatever) you could at least apply some kind of rationalisation. Because while these new cars are 100bhp down on the Ultra Performance Hybrid versions, they’re faster and more powerful than the old W12 and will do 0-62mph in as little as 3.7 seconds. Which is probably quick enough in most circumstances. The heavier GTC convertible is a touch slower than the GT coupe, taking 3.9sec to go 0-62mph instead. It also has a slightly lower electric-only range of 51 miles per charge versus 53. The official CO2 figures are a faintly ludicrous 29 and 31g/km. These four-wheel drive machines continue to feature Bentley Active Chassis Technology, including Dynamic Ride, rear-wheel steering and an eLSD. Comfort, Bentley and Sport driving modes are available as required. The Bentley Continental GT core range (pictured here in silver) includes a gloss black finish to the matrix grille with chrome surround, matt black lower grilles and gloss black front splitter and rear diffuser. Specific ‘Harmony’ headlights are different to those fitted to the GT Speed – they have a cut crystal appearance and unique welcome sequence that also plays out in the red-finished rear lights. There’s also more exterior chrome. On the inside you get ‘straight fluted’ seats and the choice of bright or dark chrome trimmings. The Azure (pictured here in blue) goes down the chrome route, too, with the shiny finish also applied to the main grille’s vertical vanes. The 22-inch wheels are silver with ‘bright machined’ finishing. The cabin is upgraded with ‘Harmony’ 3D diamond quilting and ‘Wellness’ seats as standard. You get open-pore walnut trim and enhanced interior lighting – including a panoramic glass roof for the coupe. Convertible buyers get a complementary neck warmer system. Not quite. The basic price starts at £202,400 in the UK, and for all that the hybrid system is very impressive, it will still require quite a bit of fuel-station forecourt action – especially if you’re pressing on. Delightful that Bentley is reaching out to a wider audience though, ahead of the arrival of the smaller that’s scheduled to go on sale in 2026. Introduced in 2024, the range-topping plug-in hybrid Continental GT Speed coupe and GTC convertible – labelled Ultra Performance Hybrids – are the fastest and most powerful Bentley production models ever made. The brand says this is the fourth-generation Continental GT. Treat this like a major overhaul of its predecessor with a whole load of new technology introduced, and a major heart transplant undertaken. Bentley’s grand tourer is designed to be a thumping haymaker of a car, offering ferocious power and luxury. Hence why the heavily-revised Continental GT launched with the flagship Speed variant first: to ram that point home. ‘The Speed embodies the best of what the Conti GT is all about,’ Ian Hoban, Chief Product Strategy & Delivery Officer tells CAR; ‘the Continental GT is the core of the Bentley brand and the Speed is the core of the GT brand. We’ve got to be bold.’ And bold Crewe has been, reaching new heights of power and customisation not seen before for a non-special-edition Bentley. Bentley says the latest Speed is the brand’s ‘most powerful road-going model ever created.’ The base of it is a redesigned 584bhp 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 that now features twin single-scroll turbochargers – which are boostier and laggier than twin-scroll ones, as well as being more durable and less complicated – as e-power fills in the turbolag gaps. A single 188bhp electric motor is applied, housed within the transmission to ensure e-power is available and applied even during gearchanges, and a 25.9kWh battery pack is mounted behind the rear axle. Naturally, given the Continental GT shares a base architecture with the , Bentley’s nicked the new Porsche four-door’s battery pack wholesale. But this Ultra Performance Hybrid powertrain from Bentley is more powerful than the current (for now) flagship . Total system output for the Continental GT Speed is 771bhp and a mighty 738lb ft, good for propelling 2459kg-worth of plug-in hybrid Bentley coupe to 62mph in 3.2sec, to 100mph in 6.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 208mph. In an effort to properly test the GT Speed’s performance, Bentley ran tests through Ryfylke Tunnel in Norway. Not only did this provide the location for clocking that immense top speed, but Bentley logged that it took the GT Speed coupe just 33 seconds to reach it. The GTC convertible model logs a 0-62mph sprint in 3.4sec and a limited top speed of 177mph. Christophe Georges, Bentley’s global sales and marketing director, tells us that Bentley clientele are happy to buy a hybrid ‘so long as they can see a benefit.’ It also shows us another reason why the Speed needed to be first out of the gate: it had to move the game on, and clearly, from its predecessor that used the W12 engine. The fact that this new GT Speed is 11 per cent more powerful and has 19 per cent more torque is testament to that. It’s a bonus that Bentley claims this mighty GT is capable of up to 50 miles of electric-only range, and allows the GT Speed to surge silently on the road at up to 87mph. Charging takes around two and a half hours on an 11kW charger. Nope. The new GT is still armed to the teeth with physics-bending engineering, including the brand’s new ‘Performance Active Chassis.’ That bundles together all-wheel drive, an electronic limited-slip differential, rear-wheel steering, all-round torque vectoring, active anti-roll technology. Given the inherent Porsche DNA in the Conti GT’s architecture, Bentley has applied the new dual-valve dampers that launched on the Panamera and electric Macan into the dual-chamber air suspension. Bentley says using these means a wider bandwidth between cushy, plush comfort and harder, tauter sport suspension setups. Naturally, a lot of the design is very familiar – remember that the new-generation GT is a heavy overhaul of its predecessor, rather than a ground-up engineering project. Even so, some of the details have changed; the updated Conti GT now features single headlights – something Bentley says hasn’t been seen on a ‘mainstream, non-coachbuilt Bentley until the S2 of 1959’ – and the design of the clusters themselves echo the and . There are new wheel designs and, at the rear, Bentley says no rear spoiler is needed despite that ferocious 208mph top speed due to the shaping of the tailgate. Take a quick glance inside and you’ll probably think nowt’s changed and, in reality, the structure of the cockpit certainly hasn’t. But that’s far from a complaint, and Bentley has focused on improving the amount (and, indeed, the sophistication) of the technology offered. As well as a new-generation infotainment and digital instruments with a suite of new digital services, Bentley’s promising regular updates to the technology including ‘traffic light prediction’ technology first seen in Audis in very select locations.

40,Smart #5 Brabus arrives with stonking 636bhp and 400kW charging,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/smart/5/,Jake Groves,2025-04-08,Car Magazine UK,"Smart’s biggest car yet – the #5 – has arrived, ready for its launch in Europe. We first saw images of the #5 when it was unveiled in its specification in China, but CAR has been up close and personal with the Euro-spec model that’ll launch towards the end of 2025. That model line-up includes a range of versions, including a super-powerful Brabus variant just revealed as its performance flagship. ‘The roominess, the design and the technology… the whole package, for me, is the USP,’ says Dirk Adelmann, Smart’s European CEO. As he reveals to CAR that , the #5 represents ‘a lot of firsts for us.’ We’ve got a full debrief on the new #5, including details and performance specs for its ferocious Brabus model right here. ‘We have had 2.2 million ForTwo customers in Europe over the last 26 years, and they have grown up with the brand,’ says Adelmann. ‘We have people coming from having a Smart as the second car in the household with our German mother [i.e. Mercedes-Benz], so many of them see Smart as an extension. Now these people are looking for something in a larger segment for the family, and we couldn’t offer that until now.’ Xuan Zheng Goh, Smart’s head of product management, says: ‘What #5 does is bring us to a new audience. I guess lots of car companies say that kind of thing, but what that means in real terms is that the C/D segment SUV in Europe is the second, if not even the biggest market in Europe. Being in that space opens us up to a fairly big marketplace. ‘When you look at many ForTwo buyers, it was their first car in their early 20s,’ adds Goh, ‘so they’ve now moved on in terms of the stage of their life to one with more purchasing power. It makes sense that, if they love the brand, we can give them something that might even rekindle their youth.’ The new #5 looks almost exactly like the Concept #5 that came before it, with a boxy shape that’s been rounded off in the corners almost like a , and with unique headlight and rear light designs that stretch across the width of the car. Even so, we wouldn’t call it a looker. That said it’s full of quirky details – just like the and – including floating wheel covers and frameless doors and pop-out doorhandles. But, more than anything else, the whole design is intentionally meant to separate this from those smaller cars to avoid Russian Doll-ing Smart design. Five specifications have been revealed so far: Pro, Pro+, Premium, Pulse and the Summit special edition. The ones you see in the images are the Premium (in the sandy beige colour) and the limited-run Summit Edition with its fancy set of accessories and bespoke details. The more road-focused models feature their own bumper and wheel designs, with the Summit model benefiting from some chunkier detailing and unique wheels. Summit models also come with an electronic tow bar and a roof rack with step ladder, too. It evolves some of the formula set out by the #1 and #3. What you notice early on from climbing inside is the space and the materials. Xiao Tong, the #5’s project lead, says that 90 per cent of the interior is covered in soft materials designed to make it feel plush. What dominates, though, is the enormous set of displays that cover the dashboard. On Premium and above, that consists of a driver’s digital display as well as two 13-inch displays built into one panel. The displays run an entirely new generation of Smart’s operating system, designed to offer way more customisability than the already-detailed systems in the #1 and #3, but with a lot more common sense applied to the layouts and a smidge less distraction to boot. Depending on your spec, you can also benefit from an augmented-reality head-up display in the windscreen and a 20-speaker Sennheiser audio system that features a speaker that rises out of the dashboard when active. Oh, and if you’re interested, the #5’s animated mascot is a ‘snow lion’ – compared to the fox in the #1 and the cheetah in the #3. There is also oodles of space inside, with Smart particularly focusing on providing those in the second row with plenty of room; tall adults can sit behind tall adults with loads of space to spare. Smart claims a 630-litre boot area, which is good for this size in terms of total volume. But that number is a bit of a technicality as it’s the sum of the above boot floor area (which doesn’t look all that large) combined with a huge underfloor area. Plenty. The entry-level Pro model kicks the line-up off with a 76kWh LFP battery and a single e-motor on the rear axle developing 335bhp, which is good for a 6.9sec 0-62mph sprint and a claimed 288-mile range. DC charging is up to 150kWh. From then up, however, the #5 benefits from a 100kWh NMC battery pack that uses an 800-volt architecture. Pro+ and Premium get 358bhp (good for up to 366 miles claimed range), while Pulse and Summit’s all-wheel drive configuration boost power to 579bhp for a 4.9sec 0-62mph sprint and a possible 335-mile range. Every #5 with the 100kWh battery is capable of up to 400kW of DC charging, pushing past the considered norm for European fast charging. But of course. This one was revealed a little later, going public on 8 April after the Euro-spec #5 was revealed a few weeks before. Naturally, the Brabus version benefits from its own sporty bodykit and lots of red detailing. Smart’s team are particularly proud of the wheel design, linking the most potent #5 to plenty of Brabus-tuned Mercs, for example. Inside, the hot version is swathed in microfibre materials and more flashes of red – as well as more noise fakery while you’re driving. Just like the #1 and #3 Brabus, though, the main focus is the gut-punching level of performance available. Brabus versions still feature the same 100kWh battery pack that’s capable of being charged at up to 400kW. But the twin e-motors developing a total of 636bhp makes this the most powerful Smart by some margin, making the #5 Brabus capable of a 3.8sec 0-62mph time. Brabus being part of Smart’s product mix is crucial, says Euro boss Adelmann. When the #1 first launched, 60 per cent of pre-orders in Germany were Brabus models, and Smart is keen to keep up the partnership across Europe. ‘We’re not talking about this being a ‘Brabus Line’ either,’ says Adelmann,’ this is the full execution.’ But the snag with the #1 and #3 Brabus models is that the focus was on the power and the look, while details like tyres and brakes and suspension were left standard. Adelmann confirms that as well as those bespoke wheels, the tyre option is different over the standard car to help the Brabus handle its power. ‘Constantin [Buschmann, CEO of Brabus] and his team got a good look a this car, and they got involved very early. And I know that, maybe in a couple of years time, Constantin will have something even more Brabus-ised for us.’ The #5 is expected to go on sale towards the end of 2025 in the UK, with prices expected to start around the £45k mark for a basic Pro model.

41,‘Ten times better than our competition’ - BYD boss on Denza vs premium rivals,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/denza/stella-li/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-10,Car Magazine UK,"► Another day, another European brand launch. This time it’s Denza, a brand originally created by Daimler Group and , but now acting as a more premium arm of the latter. It’ll launch in Europe this year, with a UK launch slated for 2026. For those following BYD’s automotive empire, Denza will sit above the high-volume BYD range, but below its ultra luxurious offering. To complicate matters further, it’ll sit parallel to the BYD’s off-road-orientated Fangshengbao brand. Two cars are already planned; the , and a D9 MPV which we’ve seen in passing. There’ll be around six or seven cars in total, with two of those being off-roaders. ‘The Denza brand has European influence at its heart, and we are confident that buyers will find distinctive, unique appeal in the car’s mix of sophisticated, elegant design, strong performance and astounding technology,’ said executive vice president of BYD, Stella Li, speaking at the brand launch, which took place during Milan’s design week. ‘This model is a defining example of what Denza strives to achieve; this makes it the perfect choice to lead Denza into Europe.’ Denza wants to take the fight the German premium brands, and it believes it has perfect combination of style, technology and value to do so. The European style is taken care of by ex-Alfa, Lamborghini and Seat designer Wolfgang Eggers, and the result is a car that looks a lot like the in detailing and proportions. Interestingly, the Z9 is already available in China and exists as both a shooting brake and three-box saloon – but BYD’s data suggests the shooting brake will do better in Europe. Technology is also a key aspect, with Denza benefitting heavily from BYD’s advanced tech. Take the Z9 GT for example; it gets an e3 platform with BYD-blade cell and cell-to-body tech, and it also gets some Yangwang-style trick parts that allow it swing itself 360-degrees and crab walk into tight spaces. Denza wants to take on its German competitors in technology, comfort and value – not performance – but the Z9 GT is hardly slow: the BEV takes 3.4 seconds to hit 62mph from a standstill, and thanks to a 100kWh battery, 308bhp front motor and a pair of 322bhp rear motors (Chinese specs) it produces 952bhp. Combine those performance figures with a techy interior that boasts three screens and BYD believes it has the technology to ease clear of rivals: ‘This car is really ten times better than the competition,’ Li told CAR at the brand launch, ‘we have a lot of unique features the other legacy brands do not have.’ Value is the final part of the equation and remains something a weapon of the BYD group – despite Denza’s more premium positioning. CAR understands Denza will not overlap with BYD on price (the cheapest Denza will cost more than the most expensive BYD) but it’ll offer a punchy spec sheet compared to its premium competition. ‘We are confident that buyers will find distinctive, unique appeal in the car’s mix of sophisticated, elegant design, strong performance and astounding technology,’ said executive vice president of BYD, Stella Li when asked about the Z9 GT. ‘This model is a defining example of what Denza strives to achieve; this makes it the perfect choice to lead Denza into Europe.’ Any why not an SUV? Because ‘the Z9 GT is a good model to represent BYD technology, represent the design and all the unique technology we have for Denza brand,’ she added. Just the Z9 GT and D9 MPV are on the cards for now, though more cars were shown on a slide during the brand launch. Alongside the Z9, D9 and two Fangchengbao off-roaders (which CAR understands will be sold under the Denza umbrella), there was another car under wraps – which could be the recently revealed Yangwang U7. If true, that’d be because the Denza name works better with Western audiences than the somewhat awkward Yangwang moniker. If Denza’s technology is as good as it says (which we’ll find out when we drive the car) then it has a good chance of succeeding in Europe. And even if doesn’t overcome its premium competition, an aggressive pricing strategy could mean it’ll attract customers from the segment and budgets below – a similar proposition to Chinese brands like and . What’s more Denza benefits from BYD’s groundwork and learnings: ‘we need to pay extreme attention to the after sales service,’ Li told us. ‘We bring a very technologically [advanced] model, but then we’ll build up a very strong after-sales service,’ she continued. ‘When we launch into Denza, that’s more about premium. It’s very important, not only to tell the story, but also pay attention to the details – and the service we will do much better.’ To that end, Denza will land in Europe as a very separate entity to its parent brand: it’ll be sold in a separate network to BYD, with Li confirming that the brand will benefit from its own bespoke dealers, marketing and sales teams.

42,China and EU considering removal of EV tariffs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/china-ev-tariffs/,Jake Groves,2025-04-11,Car Magazine UK,"New reports suggest the EU and China are working to remove the tariffs set by the European Union last year. According to a new report from , those in the EU are now working to replace their existing tariff strategy for one that uses minimum prices for Chinese imported cars. And while it’s been used on other goods, if talks are successful this would be the first time such a strategy is used on passenger vehicles. Of course, the talks also come against a backdrop of financial instability driven by president Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs. Keep reading for the current situation in regards to the EU’s tariff policy. EU Member states have voted in favour of new tariffs to be applied to electric cars coming in from China. Updated duty rates from findings in August 2024 would see up to 36.3 per cent in additional taxes applied to electric cars from certain Chinese car makers. In a statement, the EU Commission says: ‘the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs. This represents another step towards the conclusion of the Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation. ‘In parallel, the EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution that would have to be fully WTO-compatible, adequate in addressing the injurious subsidisation established by the Commission’s investigation, monitorable and enforceable.’ that 10 member states including France and Italy voted for the tariffs. Meanwhile, five member states voted against the measures, including Germany, and 12 abstained including Spain and Sweden. The EU has been bristling against China’s increase in prevalence in Europe for a few years now, but it came to a head in September 2023. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an ‘anti-subsidy investigation’ into electric vehicles coming from China. ‘Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,’ said von der Leyen during her annual address in September 2023. ‘Prices are kept artificially low by huge state subsidies, and this is distorting our market.’ The European Commission then investigated the matter over several months, and . It had ‘provisionally concluded that the battery electric vehicle chain in China benefits from unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU battery-electric vehicle producers.’ The EU commission had announced provisional increases on tariffs to three major Chinese EV producers: BYD, Geely and SAIC. After those initial findings, deliberations within the EU Commission produced revised tariff figures in August 2024. Under these updated findings, BYD which sells cars directly here in Europe like the and , would be slapped with a 17.0 per cent tariff increase; Geely – which doesn’t directly sell cars in Europe but part-owns Volvo, Polestar and Lynk & Co, as well has a joint venture in new-generation Smart – would be hit with a 19.3 per cent tariff; and SAIC, which wholly owns MG Motor, would be targeted with a 36.3 per cent tariff increase. These tariffs are set to come into force on 4 July. On top of that, the EU Commission said that, under this prospective tariff increase, would apply to other EV makers. If those car makers ‘cooperated in the investigation,’ they’d be subject to a 21.3 per cent duty. If they didn’t, that duty would increase to 36.3 per cent. On top of those figures, Tesla doesn’t escape tariffs either given it produces cars in China. The EU Commission announced that it is applying an ‘individual duty rate’ as an exporter from China of nine per cent. The same could apply to ‘any other company producing in China,’ according to the prospective report produced in June 2024. The European Union sees China’s increasing influence on its market as a threat, so it looking for ways to protect European suppliers and producers of cars – particularly EVs. The EU Commission said that its investigation was also designed to ‘examine the likely consequences and impact of measures on importers, users and consumers of BEVs in the EU.’ EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in her 2023 annual address that ‘fairness in the global economy is so important because it protects lives and livelihoods – entire industries and communities depend on it.’ The United States is at it, too, as President Joe Biden hiked up tariffs on electric cars from China. In a statement by The White House, the US imposed a 100 per cent tariff rate on EVs ‘to protect American manufacturers from China’s unfair trade practices.’ The move was also designed to protect the US’s investments into developing its own EV manufacturing supply chain. Not great, obviously. According to Reuters, China has ‘repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate.’ The report also points out that China ‘doesn’t want to be embroiled in another tariff war, still stung by the US tariffs on its goods.’ That came after Chinese minister for commerce, Wang Wentao pointed out in that the investigation the EU Commission conducted ‘violated the rules of the World Trade Organisaion,’ and called the tariffs ‘a typical protectionist measure.’ There has been reaction outside the direct line of fire, too. Stefan Hartung, chairman of the board at Bosch, tells CAR: ‘the automotive industry is not a technical one, it’s a consumer one. In the end, consumers decide freely what car they buy.’ ‘I’m not a big fan of tariffs – they’re something that impede free trade. Tariffs lead to dangers if they’re increased – they drive inflation and interest rates and could lead to situations where things are done twice. That’s simply not efficient and goes against the efforts to fight climate change.’ ‘The introduction of tariffs and taxation are common considerations for any international business operation to navigate,’ an Xpeng spokesperson told CAR. ‘Regardless of tariff fluctuations, Xpeng remains dedicated to enhancing the appeal of our products and services through ongoing innovation and optimisation. We are committed to proactively maintaining market competitiveness while minimising any potential impact on our current and future customers.’ The automotive industry has also been busy with methods to potentially circumvent any changes in stance that the EU and China may have. BYD, for example, announced at the end of 2023 that it would build a plant in Hungary. The short answer is that, if these tariffs go through, the cost of cars coming into Europe will increase. How much that extends to the UK, given it’s not part of the EU single market post-Brexit, isn’t entirely confirmed but may still have an impact. For Europe, though, these tariffs could drastically change the prices of electric cars coming from China – provided they go ahead unchallenged or unaltered.

43,Audi's new A6 saloon injects a bit of 90s into its look,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/a6/,Jake Groves,2025-04-15,Car Magazine UK,"Audi’s new A6 model range is complete, as the covers come off the sleek new saloon. As always, the A6 saloon sits alongside the A6 Avant that was unveiled in March 2025. Naturally, the A6 is designed to compete with the and . For this generation, after some fumbling of names, there are also battery-electric models badged as A6 e-Tron. Interestingly, Audi decided to unveil the A6 Avant first. Europe loves the estate model; around 87 per cent of demand for the A6 Avant comes from Europe, with nine per cent in China and just four per cent for the rest of the world. Yes, the . That said, there is plenty of appetite for the saloon model in markets like China and North America. The design profile of this new A6 isn’t that much of a surprise, following other recent models revealed by Ingolstadt like the and . Interestingly, there’s a little more distinction from the than we predicted, with a subtly different front-end design and an entirely different rear light arrangement, for example. In fact, it’s the lighting that shows off the most differences. As well as unique signatures over its e-Tron counterpart, the A6 Avant comes with some quite overtly industrial-looking headlight lenses with exposed metal fins and mesh in them. Naturally, like those other recent Audi reveals, you can customise the light signatures front and rear – including one that’s perpetually animated. There’s also a machined look to the headlights, with exposed pieces of metal in the headlights that are designed to give a structural look to them. The saloon’s shape at the rear is very interesting, and reminds us of the C5-generation A6, almost as if Audi’s looking back through some design classics. The rounded-off tailgate is – like the Avant – furnished with Audi’s latest lighting tech. OLED lights can display graphics like warning triangles, or come with a clever (and permanently-animated) daytime running effect. While the exterior design may be something we somewhat expected, it’s the smoothness of the look that enables Audi to claim this as its most aerodynamic car with an engine. If you’ve read anything on the latest-generation A5, Q6 e-Tron or the A6 e-Tron then this’ll sound a bit like a broken record. Why? Because the new, combustion-powered A6 features largely the same interior as those other cars. Solid materials, lots of gloss black panelling for your haptic and touch-sensitive buttons and a MASSIVE panel named the Digital Stage that houses the instruments and central infotainment screen are all present and correct. Just like they are in those other cars. One of the people responsible for this is Mattijs van Tuijl, interior creative co-ordinator. ‘I’ve been working on these projects [i.e.: A5, Q6 e-Tron and A6] at the same time, and you want to create a family feel between them,’ he says. ‘Especially with the A6, though, we were keen not to overload with technology – it has to be there for a reason.’ The huge Android-based infotainment looks glossy and modern, with a useful homepage that will show your most used functions and a fixed touch panel bar at the bottom of the display for climate controls. We’d still prefer physical controls, and a lot less gloss black plastic, but there you go. With the A6, the driving position feels very adjustable with the ability to sit low and visibility feels better than a comparable 5-series Touring. Rear space is impressive, with reasonable headroom and good legroom even when sat behind a tall driver. Boot space isn’t that impressive for either bodystyle. In the saloon, Audi claims a 492-litre luggage area – smaller than a 5-series and E-Class, which is then lowered even moreso if you spec a model with the MHEV Plus system. For the Avant, Audi rates it to 503 litres from floor to parcel shelf – a chunk smaller than an E-Class Estate or 5-series Touring. For the UK market at launch, we’ll only get 2.0-litre four-cylinder engines – a shame when Europe benefits from a V6, too. The launch engines are the top tier engines available for the A5; a 201bhp TFSI petrol and a 201bhp TDI diesel. The front-wheel drive-only petrol sprints to 62mph in 8.3sec and tops out at 149mph. Choose the diesel and it’s fitted with quattro all-wheel drive and Audi’s MHEV Plus system that increases the electrification element to allow for low-speed driving with the engine off, and 22bhp of electric boost. After the initial launch of these combustion engines, expect a TFSIe plug-in hybrid model to join the range later. Want something Audi Sport flavoured? You’ll have to wait a bit for an S6 or an RS6. Both will use a fiery twin-turbo V6, with the latter benefitting from some potent electrical assistance. That’s as well as the . As for other engineering details, you have a choice of suspension options: standard, sport or air. Standard is fitted to Sport trim models, and Audi claims it’s designed to be ‘even more comfortable than its predecessor.’ Go for S line or Edition 1 trims and the spot setup is fitted by default. Want air springs? You’ll need to pay extra for that. Audi says the new A6 Avant goes on sale no in the UK, priced from £51,510 for a basic Sport model with the petrol engine, while a base diesel clocks in at £56,780. If you’re after a flagship Edition 1 model, you’re looking at a price north of £60k. We’ll have to hang on a smidge for saloon prices, but they’ll be a couple of grand cheaper.

44,Leapmotor’s plan to sacrifice Euro NCAP stars at the altar of user friendliness,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/leapmotor/safety-technology-plans/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-04-15,Car Magazine UK,"Drivers hate active safety technology. A found 25% of UK drivers who have lane assist don’t use it because they find it ‘actively annoying.’ Plus, 16% said they never use their car’s adaptive cruise control, while 15% report they avoid driver monitoring systems whenever possible. And I agree. It’s all annoying. The reason why almost every new car on sale has this tech, despite its widespread hatred, is simple. Manufacturers need this technology to get their cars through . Without it, they’d be penalised by the safety body, even if their cars did a fantastic job of protecting occupants in an accident. But what if manufacturers didn’t care what Euro NCAP thought and simply built their cars according to how their owners use them? It’d be refreshing, wouldn’t it? Well, that’s exactly what Leapmotor is considering for its upcoming electric vehicles. At the launch of the , I got chatting to Francesco Giacalone, head of Leapmotor’s European marketing department. He told me his customers aren’t using lane assist and speed assist, so the brand is considering making the technology not on by default every time the car is started. It’d be the driver’s decision whether to use the tech, not the car’s. ‘Euro NCAP ratings will not always be inexpensive and will not always be easy to achieve,’ he said. ‘So, probably, at that point in time, there could be the compromise whether to not reach the NCAP, but to [instead] provide the promise of the [Leapmotor] brand, which is to deliver . ‘And again, right now, if you look at the markets, the five-star NCAP is not so spread. It’s reasonable to expect that not all Leapmotor products will achieve that standard because, on B-SUV, it’s fairly difficult to reach that level of standards. ‘Maybe to sacrifice one star to deliver the right product to the customer, with the full content of useful and life-easing technology? That could be the right choice.’ Oh yeah, there’s nowt so certain. But Leapmotor’s prepared for the fallout. Plus, its scores shouldn’t take too much of a hit because it won’t completely remove the technology from its cars. It’ll just all be automatically off when you switch on the ignition. Giacalone agreed, saying: ‘Of course, we will not go to the extreme of the spectrum where we launch a car that has no active safety, and the passive safety is crap. All vehicles from Leapmotor are engineered with high-strength stainless steel on the side and the frame so the cabin is sturdy. ‘All those elements will be there. Just maybe, to achieve the five-star, you need some active safety which not all consumers equally appreciate. Then, either you make a compromise in that little last mile and probably that will cost you a star – that could be the case – but there’s no compromise on the broad security of the car.’ He closed his remarks on the topic by saying: ‘The message is that all the tech, hardware and software, is . So, if you want, we enable it.’ This is a huge shift in rhetoric from an industry so utterly obsessed with meeting safety regulations – and one I reckon consumers will welcome. Let’s hope the Leapmotor can be the catalyst for change. Luke is the Deputy Editor of our sister site Parkers, but he spends plenty of time writing news, reviews and features for CAR.

45,Cashing carbon credits and sharing EV tech: Leapmotor’s relationship with Stellantis,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/leapmotor/relationship-with-stellantis/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-04-16,Car Magazine UK,"In 2023, Stellantis bought a 21% stake in the Chinese company, Leapmotor. When the deal was struck, its reported purposes were quite simple. The biggest aim was to increase Leapmotor’s sales outside its home market, using Stellantis’s enormous dealer network. Stellantis achieved this by forming a new company called Leapmotor International. It owns 51% of that firm, thus giving it exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute Leapmotor cars outside of China. And it’s had a good start to the year. At the time of writing, you could buy a Leapmotor from 44 Stellantis dealers across the UK – but the firm has an aggressive expansion plan. Damien Dally, Leapmotor International’s UK brand director told me that’ll increase to 60 locations by early July and 80 locations by the end of the year. The reason why Stellantis is so keen to get Leapmotors into its showrooms is because of carbon credits. Damien explained: ‘Stellantis has got to hit these horrible things called ZEV targets. It needs to have a 28% BEV mix. Leapmotor will be an enabler within Stellantis to achieve that 28%, which means that Stellantis, effectively, can sell more ICE vehicles. So, actually, you know, it’s a good addition to the family at quite an interesting time.’ Stellantis is hoping EV agnostics with no brand loyalty will see Leapmotor’s advertising and be persuaded to make the switch because of the brand’s attractive starting prices and generous equipment levels. So, to capitalise on the opportunity, Stellantis is turbocharging Leapmotor’s UK roll out to make it as easy as possible for consumers to get their hands on the cars. In essence, Leapmotor is allowing Stellantis to play for time until it’s completely rolled out its next generation STLA platforms, helping it dodge fines and continue to turn a profit on its petrol vehicles in the process. This has been made even easier now the . I’ve sat opposite several Leapmotor executives now, from marketing to product development, and I’ve asked them all the same question. When will Stellantis start using Leapmotor platforms and powertrains to underpin its cars? I can see this being particularly attractive for Stellantis’s core small car brands such as Citroen, Fiat and Peugeot. Historically, these brands have had skin in the cheap city car game – but they’ve had to step out of the ring due to issues with affordability. Put simply, they can’t turn a profit on a cheap A-segment car. But Leapmotor could change that. The T03 is on sale now for £15,995. It’s the fourth-cheapest new car in the UK, sitting behind the , and . If Stellantis was to take the T03’s platform and build a new generation of dirt-cheap city cars on it, they’d knock Dacia off its perch overnight. And it seems to be something Leapmotor and Stellantis are considering, even if they’re not ready to confirm it yet. I quizzed Tianyue Zhong, Leapmotor’s Global Head of Product Planning, about whether Stellantis will use Leapmotor’s technology in its cars. He, rather indirectly, explained: ‘For me, we work for Leapmotor brand. So, all the models with the Leap badge – that’s our scope. So, I cannot really comment on this. They already started something because Leapmotor is already working closely [with Stellantis]. ‘One thing, our CEO of Leapmotor International, because of Leapmotor, he’s now also promoted as the COO of Stellantis China. So, that means he will integrate more resource with Leapmotor and Stellantis China, such as the R&D departments and other functions.’ Whatever the future holds for Leapmotor, we can be certain it won’t be combustion cars. Leapmotor has already hedged its bets on a range-extended version of the C10 – and Zhong disclosed there are more range extenders and potentially a few PHEVs in the works – but that’s as far as it’ll go. Leapmotor won’t take the same approach as Stellantis by building petrol and electric versions of the same car on the same platform. When quizzed on the topic, Zhong said: ‘Petrol no. Never. Because the reason is very easy. Once you have the range extender – or probably plug-in hybrid can be considered in the future – but once you have these hybrid cars, why would you go for petrol cars? ‘For a usual customer, like a normal customer, the EV experience is really much better than petrol cars. For not like a petrolhead or those car lovers – those who just want to drive from A to B – the EV experience is much better. And with so much advanced technology, and pricing that’s probably just comparable to petrol cars, why would you go to petrol cars?’ This simplicity, both in powertrain options and in specification, is core to Leapmotor’s identity. Damien said: ‘One thing we want to stick to is this one specification principle. We think we’re onto something with that. The position of making it really, really high spec. The position of having a sunroof as standard. It’s something we want to stick to. ‘The car industry has made a business out of this, hasn’t it? You see it on TV. XYZ brand – I’m not going to name any other brands – from £19,995. You walk into the showroom and go “hang on, I saw this on TV for £19,995, but that’s £28,000.” Oh yeah, but it’s got this, it’s got this, it’s got this. Whereas for us, it’s £15,995. Choose your colour. It’s got everything on it. ‘So, we’ll stick to this. It’s about value, guys. Value doesn’t mean cheap. It means I’m giving you a s**tload of content with really high perceived value. And this is important because I could give my 13-year-old son a nice Hewlett Packard laptop but, because it hasn’t got an illuminated fruit on the front, even though it’s cost me £500, it’s of no value to him.’ The next few years are certainly going to be very interesting – and I reckon the rest of the Stellantis brands have a reason to be worried. Roll on this time next year when we can get a proper picture of the sales reports.

Meet the X Gran Equator, a new off-road concept car for which ‘no stopping’ may well have been the headline of the brief. Its Genesis’ take on the overlander – the go anywhere machine. It’s the one you could in a straight line should you feel so inclined. Environmentalists be damned. But unlike most overlanders, clunky old Defenders and such, the X Gran Equator wants to take you there in style and comfort. Genesis says the exterior was inspired by reductive design principles – smooth and uncluttered, but also with the brand’s two-line headlights involved to ensure the X Gran Equator looks ‘as purposeful as it is striking.’ Yeah, yeah, that’s great but I’m more interested in the interior. I mean if you’re going to corrupt the innocence of an as yet untouched jungle tribe, might as well roll out the golden floor mats. Show ‘em what advanced civilisation’s been up to for the last couple thousand years. Notice the criss-crossed rear-seat stitching, the exquisite bygone-meets-modern dashboard with recessed clock dials for infotainment data. It’s so old-hat Bentley-fied English, I’d half expect the ghost of Paddy Ashdown to emerge from the glove box at the summit of Kilimanjaro just to break out the midday sherries. Equator sounds pretty self-explanatory… so it can get to the equator, right? There’s more to it than that. Genesis says its overlander concept car derives its name from an Arabian horse known as Equator – the ‘finest stallion in the world of Arabian horses’, with which the car shares characteristics of ‘balance, beauty and strength.’ Sigh… Genesis has been on a bit of a warpath of brand development in recent months. Last year it announced its intentions to go racing in the World Endurance Championship, which seemed a little far-fetched for a Hyundai luxury off-shoot but that’s the plan. We’ve even had a According to the brand, the X Gran Equator is indicative of its interest in exploring lifestyle-oriented cars as a future product direction. While sadly not yet confirmed for production, Genesis says X Gran Equator has been an exercise in showcasing future design potential, so watch this space.

47,Asian manufacturers dominate 2025's New York motor show despite lingering tariff troubles,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/new-york/2025/,James Dennison,2025-04-17,Car Magazine UK,"The 125 anniversary of the New York International Auto Show takes place under a cloud of uncertainty owing to global tariffs that have had major implications throughout the auto industry. Some manufacturers have suspended exports to the US while the situation resolves itself, while others are braving the 25% tariff. Down at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, however, the show must go on and several manufacturers have brought new metal to New York City in a show of defiance. CAR magazine is on the ground at this year’s event and we’ve rounded up all the most important car unveils. Keep reading for the full run-down of new car previews. Celebrating its 10 anniversary, Genesis arrives in New York with two new unveils that couldn’t be any more different. Named after the Arabian horse breed, the X Gran Equator is a striking off-road electric concept vehicle designed to preview a possible luxury SUV that would take on the Land Rover Defender. Any production version would likely not be due until the end of the decade, but the proportions of the X Gran Equator mark a notable shift away from Genesis’ current design language. With a long bonnet and narrow glasshouse, the general look harks back to American station wagons and would differ considerably to boxier SUV rivals. Proving the diversity of its automotive portofolio, Genesis has unveiled its World Endurance Championship hypercar entry for 2026 and beyond. The GMR-001 will use a V8 hybrid powertrain and make its 24hrs of Le Mans debut next year. The team will be led by ex-Renault F1 team principal Cyril Abiteboul and feature decorated German racing driving André Lotterer as well as 2 x IMSA champion Pipo Derani. All being well, a second car will run a parallel IMSA campaign in the 2027 season. Hyundai is having a comparatively quiet show – unlike sister companies Genesis and Kia – but still made time for an unveil of the updated Palisade SUV. Now available with a hybrid powertrain for the first time, the Palisade Hybrid SUV uses a 2.5-litre four-cylinder with two electric motors. There’s currently no plans to launch the vehicle in the UK. The EV3 wasn’t unveiled at the show, but on the Wednesday morning it was confirmed as the World Car of the Year 2025. Check out our review of it, here. Freshly unveiled in hatchback form (it’s already in the wild as a saloon) the K4 has been strongly tipped to replace the Ceed in the UK. And, with no more Ford Focus on sale, it’s got a clear run at the VW Golf in the medium sized hatchback market. Powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine, it comes with an eight-speed automatic gearbox and a cabin design similar to Kia’s EV range. The EV4 made its US debut at the New York show. Using the same 400v architecture as the EV3, it will use a 201bhp front-mounted motor and deliver a range of up to 391 miles in saloon form. Expect a UK launch in the second half of 2025. Subaru has been one of the big stories at the New York show with key new model unveils. The first of which is the Trailseeker EV – the brand’s first dedicated electric vehicle. Dual motors mean four-wheel drive and 375bhp in a package similarly sized to the combustion-engined Outback. UK deliveries are set to begin next year. The Solterra electric SUV has received a dramatic update with refreshed styling, more range and better performance. Range is expected to be in excess of 300 miles thanks to the new, larger 74.4kWh battery while a four-wheel drive powertrain helps deliver 0-62mph in less than 5 seconds. UK prices for this new version are yet to be announced. Toyota has unveiled two special edition versions of its most popular sports cars for the US market. The Supra MkV Final Edition gets bigger brakes, revised suspension, modified aero and several visual tweaks including matte black wheels. Meanwhile, the GR86 Yuzu Special Edition gets upgraded Brembo brakes, SACHS dampers and an exclusive Yuzu Yellow exterior colour.

48,Hyundai Staria: EV powertrain on the way,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/staria/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-17,Car Magazine UK,"MPVs are back – but not as we knew them. The Chinese and South Korean brands are showing more and more space-age people-movers – and some of them may actually come to the UK at some point. The Hyundai Staria is one of them – and new spy shots suggest it’ll be soon getting an electric powertrain in addition to the current hybrid. Although it already appears to be from the future, the Staria is due a facelift – and these pictures confirm it’ll also be going BEV. CAR understands the update will arrive in the usual markets next year, with the MPV packing in a 84kWh battery for a range of just over 200-miles. When it does arrive, it’ll be going up against familiar faces like the Mercedes V-Class and VW I.D Buzz, but it’ll also face new challenges from the and We’ll update this story when we know more. Remember the , Hyundai’s van-based MPV that was popular with large families looking for a value-for-money holdall? Well, this other-worldly offering is its replacement – that’s right, you’re looking open-mouthed at the Hyundai Staria. And no, these aren’t close-to-production concept-car images, either – these are the first official photos of the Staria in showroom spec. What with the and among others, Hyundai’s really on a roll right now. Up front, the Staria’s sloping nose is delightfully unadorned, topped by an LED light bar with low-slung headlamps, as per the new Tucson. Fripperies are few and far between, with higher-spec Starias garnished with tinted brass trim elements and LED headlamps clustered in jewel-like arrangement. Enveloping the passenger area is a smooth fuselage that manages to be both tall and upright without looking obviously boxy – note the low window-line to aid cabin airiness. Some markets will have space for up to 11 passengers, but the majority of Starias for Europe will be seven-seaters – more on that later. At the back is a colossal tailgate flanked by a pair of full-height LED lamp units. Hyundai’s yet to share a photo of the Staria’s dashboard, but expect a 10.25-in touchscreen for the multimedia functions, plenty of storage cubbies and a scalloped-out section on the passenger side to allow even more space. Access to the rear compartment is via a pair of sliding doors, with a pair of captain’s chairs in the middle, and a three-passenger bench in the rear row. Spec-up your Staria appropriately and that middle pair of seats can be upgraded to ones that revolve 180º or recline like those in the posh end of an airliner, including with integral legrests. Dreamy. Roof-mounted air-con vents sit in the rear strips of LED ambient lighting framing the interior with a choice of 64 relaxing colours – one in the eye for the and . Power for this space shuttle comes courtesy not of rocket fuel, but a 175bhp 2.2-litre diesel for European models – other markets also have a 268bhp 3.5-litre petrol. Given Hyundai’s investment and expertise in mild, self-charging and plug-in hybrid powertrains, in addition to its BEV and options, it seems curious that the Staria’s not available with at least one of those cleaner options from the outset, but an alternative to the diesel is close. It all sounds an appealing mix for ferrying large families about, so what’s the bad news? As it stands, there’s no confirmation that the Staria is coming to Britain. Hyundai UK wants it to, and it is being built in right-hand-drive form for other markets that drive on the left, so a 2022 introduction is possible.

49,Audi in F1: winner in waiting or big money mistake?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/formula-one-in-2026/,Edd Straw,2025-04-18,Car Magazine UK,"You can see why people are sceptical about Audi’s prospects in Formula 1, with some current teams confiding they’re not sure Audi will ever break through as an F1 frontrunner, despite its incredible Le Mans legacy. Rumours of wavering commitment have flared up periodically in Germany – most recently triggered by the news that Audi will shut its Brussels plant in February – but are consistently denied. It seems wrong, say the doubters, for Audi to be investing so much in F1 when its main business, making road cars, is going through a lean spell. But Audi is adamant it is committed to F1. The sport is booming, so the team’s value will only increase. Quitting now would be absurd unless there’s a buyer willing to spend a 10-digit sum. Audi’s F1 team isn’t a start-up. A deal was struck to acquire a controlling stake in Sauber in 2022. The name won’t change until 2026, but Audi has been quietly on the F1 grid for two-and-a-half seasons. Sauber uses Ferrari engines today, but in 2026 Audi’s power unit will arrive. Work is well advanced on the 1.6-litre turbo engine, built to new rules requiring a 50:50 split of hybrid and internal combustion energy. That project is based in Audi’s Competence Centre Motorsport in Neuburg an der Donau. As long ago as June 2024, engine project boss Adam Baker said its full power unit ‘is running dynamically on the test bench’. The driver line-up has now been confirmed, starting with Sauber in 2025, and in place for at least the next three years. Veteran Nico Hulkenberg joins from Haas, satisfying Audi’s desire for a German driver, with 20-year-old Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto bought out of a McLaren ‘development driver’ contract to partner him. Audi CEO Gernot Dollner was keen on a young driver, hence the ousting of 10-times GP winner Valtteri Bottas. The key personnel off the track are also now confirmed, after a rocky start. When the Audi/Sauber deal was struck Frederic Vasseur ran the team, but he left for Ferrari at the end of 2022, with Andreas Seidl, architect of Porsche’s Le Mans successes in the 2010s, already lined up to come in as CEO. A power struggle developed between Seidl and Audi’s Oliver Hoffmann, with both ousted in July. In their place came Mattia Binotto, Ferrari team boss in 2019-2022, who took up the dual role of chief operating officer and chief technical officer. In the summer of 2025, Jonathan Wheatley, a key architect of Red Bull’s success, joins as team principal. Sauber needs to sharpen up on track, as the team’s regression from sixth-best in F1 when the initial Audi deal was done to the worst right now is an indictment of the wasted time. The fact that number one driver target Carlos Sainz turned down a big money Audi deal to join struggling Williams is also pretty damning and feeds the scepticism.

50,Euro NCAP isn't working says Citroën CEO,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/citroen/euro-ncap/,Ted Welford,2025-04-21,Car Magazine UK,"► Stellantis and Euro NCAP do not currently see eye to eye on the question of safety. The independent safety organisation made a jab at the automotive group last year when the Jeep Avenger scored just three stars out of five. Euro NCAP’s secretary general Michiel van Ratingen said the Avenger’s results demonstrated a ‘clear lack of ambition’ at Stellantis and that ‘safety should not be where a manufacturer makes its savings’. It’s a pretty scathing remark. Thierry Koskas, Citroën CEO, has now responded in the same spirit, telling CAR he doesn’t think there needs to be another organisation, other than governments, checking the safety of new cars. ‘The requirements put in by Europe and by the different governments are already challenging enough and we think complying with the regulation is a good way to answer to the safety concern of the population. ‘I don’t need see why any government would need an additional body to decide what should be the right safety.’ The last Citroën to face NCAP was the C5X back in 2022. The new C3 and C3 Aircross have not been tested by the safety organisation. Koskas strongly denied that any corners had been cut when it came to safety and said Citroën fully supports ‘more and more demanding’ regulations. He also insisted the relatively low-cost new Smart Car platform that underpins the C3 and other Stellantis products was not compromised on safety. ‘We have a car that is very simple with few options – it’s not something that is detrimental to customers. They are requesting simple things, not many trims, not many options. This is something that makes the car cheaper to produce, there are less parts in the car.’ It’s in line with a shift in philosophy signalled back in 2021 by the Oli concept – less choice, less weight and less cost for both manufacturer and consumer. It all sounds very Dacia but Koskas rejects the idea that Citroën is to Stellantis what Dacia is to Renault. (Dacia has also had some run-ins with NCAP.) ‘We are not Dacia because we have more than 100 years of history, we have very strong values, we have iconic models, so I don’t want to be compared.’ Even so, Koskas is bullish about the relative merits of the C3 over the Sandero, as well as the C3 Aircross against the Duster when discussing the matter further. Customers may in fact be wooed away from Citroën by Chinese brands – including, potentially, Leapmotor, a name arriving in the UK this year with help from Stellantis, utilising the group’s showrooms and existing sales platforms. It’s a bold move, not least when Citroën is introducing its lower-cost electric cars, and fellow Stellantis brands Fiat and Vauxhall are doing similar with their Grande Panda and Frontera. But Koskas isn’t worried. ‘Whether they are there internally or externally, they are there anyway. This is a competition that exists and it’s possibly the biggest challenge we have. At the end of the day there is space for everyone.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
51,Renault builds a ‘supercar’: specs for new 5 Turbo 3E revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/5-turbo-3e/,Ted Welford,2025-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"You can now reserve Renault’s all-out 5 Turbo 3E. Reservations for the ‘mini-supercar’ opened today, with customers now able to make an appointment, and sign a reservation for one of the 1980 cars to be made. Still, there will be a decent amount of time to wait after that: customers will be contacted by dealer about the extensive customisation process next year, with finalising and actual ordering happening in the first half of 2027. As you’d expect from a £135,000 car there are a wealth of options available – from seats and door panels and exterior colours and liveries. If you’re prepared to pay, you’ll even be able to select which number of the car you get. Deliveries should begin later in 2027. Production-spec details of Renault’s hardcore, high-performance and super-exclusive 5 Turbo 3E have been revealed. Yes, that’s right – production-spec. Renault plans to really build this wild machine, confirming a 2027 delivery date. Renault calls it ‘more than just a restomod’ of the 5 Turbo, with some super serious ground-up engineering, cutting-edge tech and some help from Alpine engineers. As a refresher, Renault continues to pump the retro well for all its worth. Towards the end of 2024, Renault unveiled the Turbo 3E show car (different, mind you, from …) via an Amazon Prime documentary about how the French firm has turned around its fortunes. Effectively, it’s a proper retro redesign that echoes that of the original R5 Turbo. Renault’s team are billing it as a ‘mini supercar’ because of the performance, technology and bespoke-ness of the whole project. The entire car’s structure is hewn from carbonfibre, and Renault says each one of the 1980 examples being made are hugely customisable. Just like a supercar, then. For that, Renault Renault has confirmed some more specs since the initial reveal. The production model features an 800-volt electronic architecture for fast charging, which is tailor-made for the car. Because of that electrical setup, Renault claims up to 350kW DC charging for the 70kWh battery pack. Two in-wheel electric motors are included developing 533bhp in total, which are placed on the rear wheels for plenty of spicy performance. Because they’re in-wheel motors, Renault claims extreme torque (a laughable 3540lb ft), good for a 0-62mph sprint in less than 3.5sec and a top speed of 168mph. Renault also says the Turbo 3E production car claims a 248-mile range. Those e-motors also enable some mega powerslides – so much so that Renault is throwing in some drift-spec tech. Renault has given us a couple of details on the interior, too, which will feature a vertical drift handbrake for the lols. Reservations open towards the end of March, with the first production models being delivered in 2027. Prices aren’t confirmed, but this will easily a six-figure car.

52,"Mercedes Vision V concept unveiled: a futuristic, private lounge on wheels",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/vision-v-concept/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Vision V, a new electric concept that previews Mercedes’ next chapter in the van and people mover segment. Based on an all-new modular, scalable platform called Van Electric Architecture VAN.EA, it aims to combine the usual space you get in vans along with a heightened element of exclusivity and luxury. And yes, it’s also a strong hint at what the next V-Class will be like. ‘The Mercedes-Benz Vans have been iconic for decades. With the Vision V we take that heritage and transform it into a completely new context of highest luxury transportation,’ said Gorden Wagener, chief design officer at Mercedes. ‘This show car embodies the perfect harmony between luxury and van design, setting a new benchmark for the future.’ The Vision V is just a show car for now, but it’s a clear statement of intent for Mercedes’ van portfolio. In addition to the tech underneath – which we’ll hear more about in the future – the Vision V crucially steers the V-Class towards the ‘private lounge’ ethos we’re starting to see from competitors such as Lexus and even Xpeng. With that in mind, Mercedes’ designers have gone all-out in the concept, with the interior looking a sci-fi cocktail lounge. And amongst all the aluminium, Nappa leather translucent plastic and mirrors, the Vision V’s interior is packed with cutting-edge technology. Inside there’s a 4K, retractable 65-inch TV screen, with side windows that can become additional screens and ambient lightning that makes the screen feel bigger. At the same time, it’s paired with a 42-speaker Dolby Atmos certified system for all encompassing sound. Mercedes says the tech is a capable of delivering seven user modes: entertainment, relax, gaming, work, shopping, discover and karaoke, with each bit of technology working to create a cocoon of entertainment or peace – depending on the needs of the passengers. Privacy glass with configurable opacity also lets more or less light in depending on the mode Of course, the driver and front passenger aren’t left out, so they get a triple screen Superscreen dash that runs from pillar to pillar. Using a custom UX, it’s capable of delivering surround-style navigational among other things. The exterior treatment of the concept is equally bold, with the Vision V taking in bits of EQS and Mercedes’ other concept cars. At the front we get a stuck-on grille as shown on several EQ models, a glowing Mercedes badge, as well an incredibly sculpted headlight array. At the rear Mercedes the Vision V gets an O-shaped brake light, again echoing some of Mercedes’ other recent concepts. The whole thing rolls on huge 24-inch wheels, with integrated lights. The Vision V isn’t available to buy and exists only in concept form, but the production V-class it previews should break cover next year.

53,AUDI E5: Ingolstadt's China-only electric SUV is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/china-e5/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"Last year : a joint venture between Audi and SAIC designed solely to keep pace with the trends and demands of the Chinese car market. Now we’ve got at the E5 Sportback, the car that will launch AUDI to the world – but only be sold in China. Revealed over at Auto Shanghai, it’s a handsome that bears little resemblance to the Ingolstadt side of the family tree. ‘With our new China-only brand AUDI, we are continuing to push boundaries’ said Gernot Döllner, chairman of the board of management of AUDI AG. ‘The E5 Sportback offers the very best qualities of Audi, reimagined for and tailored to customers in China.’ ‘The AUDI E5 Sportback is our first model based on the Advanced Digitized Platform, and it delivers on our brand promise: the best of both worlds,’ said Fermín Soneira CEO of the Audi and SAIC project. ‘Audi’s DNA and engineering excellence is blended with China’s digital ecosystem and innovations, specifically tailored for our tech-savvy customers.’ It’s a fastback measuring 4881m long, 1959mm wide and 1478mm tall. Underneath it’ll use AUDI’s (not Audi’s) new modular platform called the Advanced Digitized Platform. Created with China in mind, it offers better scope for over-the-air updates and fits in neatly with the country’s already huge NEV (new energy vehicle) supply chain. As you’d expect, it uses 800-volt circuitry for faster charging, too. There’ll be a 100kWh batter and four electric powertrains on offer with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, and power levels coming in at 295bhp, 402bhp, 570bhp and a range-topping 776bhp. The flagship motor will hit 0-62mph in just 3.4 seconds while range will stretch up to 478 miles, though this is presumably CLTC – which is all it needs to be given the car is on sale in China only. The E5 gets all the tech it needs to compete in the incredibly tooled-up Chinese market. With that in mind, it gets all-wheel steering and adaptive air suspension on the handling side but also gets an assisted driving system that includes a LiDAR, three wave radars, twelve ultrasonic sensors, eleven cameras and several multi-modal sensing units. Inside, you’ll find digital mirrors flanking a huge 27-inch pillar-to-pillar 4K display. Powered by one of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8295 automotive chipsets, it promises to be quick to use – partly because of touch gestures and persistent menu items. The Audi E5 will enter the market in summer 2025 – once again emphasising the quick pace of the Chinese market – with two more electric AUDI models due in 2026 and 2027.

54,Say yes to the ES? Lexus’ new saloon arrives with hybrid and EV power,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lexus/es/,Jake Groves,2025-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"Lexus has unveiled its next-generation ES saloon in China, as the luxury brand hopes to capitalise more on the world’s biggest car market. The new ES has been revealed at Auto Shanghai 2025 and will feature hybrid and EV models when it goes on sale in Europe in early 2026. ‘Lexus is a global brand,’ Lexus Europe boss, Pascal Ruch, tells CAR. ‘We sell around 850,000 cars worldwide, with around 12 to 14 per cent of that in Europe – which is decent. But that means, in other regions, we sell much more. In other regions [like China], bigger cars are something that are still well liked. ‘Our approach will be where some cars are specific to the Chinese market… to India… to the US… some for us [in Europe]. While we [i.e. Lexus in Europe] might not be the driver in the development of that car, we can still offer it.’ So the new ES, then, is heavily focused on appealing to China. Lexus says it’s aim is to ‘make luxury personal,’ and shows its ES off with a super clean look. It’s a larger car in every direction than , with Lexus pointing to the car’s 80mm longer wheelbase meaning more room inside. The interior itself is clean and neat – arguably a departure of what we consider to be a modern Lexus interior – with a high centre console, soft materials and large central screen. This generation of ES uses the TNGA-K platform – the same architecture used by plenty of Toyota and Lexus models like the as well as the and . For this new ES, though, Lexus says the platform has been redesigned. TNGA-K also enables hybrid and battery-electric powertrain options. For Europe, we’ll have the choice of an ES 300h hybrid developing 198bhp, as well as two electric models: ES 350e with 221bhp and the twin-motor ES 500e with 338bhp. We’ll have to hang on to find out more details on the European-spec ES. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

55,Volkswagen goes all-in on China with three bold new concepts,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/auto-shanghai-2025-concepts/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"► Volkswagen has revealed three concepts at Auto Shanghai as it doubles down on its ‘In China, for China’ strategy. Called the Aura, the Era and the Evo, each concept represents a collaboration between VW and a different Chinese manufacturer. The Aura is produced by FAW-Volkswagen, the Era by SAIC Volkswagen and the Evo by Volkswagen Anhui, but all preview the future direction for Chinese VWs: a focus on new energy vehicles (NEVs) and technology such as Level 2++ autonomous driving and AI. ‘The three concept vehicles are the visible outcome of our ‘In China, for China’ strategy,’ said Thomas Schäfer, VW CEO. ‘We have thus made all the necessary preparations to remain in pole position among foreign automakers in China.’ The ID.Era is full-size SUV from SAIC Volkswagen with a range-extender powertrain (NEV means anything electrified in China) and three rows of seats. It’ll do 435 miles thanks to the fuel-powered generator alone and a further 186 miles from an integrated battery. Put it all together and you’re looking at a range of over 600 miles CLTC. The ID. Evo is another full-size SUV, but this using all electric power with a focus on younger, fashion-conscious buyers. With that in mind it’s funky and has a focus on tech – particularly around over-the-air software updates. What’s more, it uses 800v technology for better efficiency and faster charging. The ID.Aura comes from FAW-Volkswagen and prioritises technology above all else. It uses the new Compact Main Platform (CMP) and promises to use AI to improve its self-technology. Its UI also emulates that of a smartphone, to make more youthful technology-savvy customers to feel right at home. On the outside, it’s a notchback – combining the affordability and dynamics of a hatchback, with the room and boot space of a larger car. All three models will make it to production in some guise, and VW is targeting a roll out before 2028 for all three: ‘We picked up ‘China speed’ with our new development centre in Hefei. Our goal is to develop our models within 34 months at most,’ said Thomas Ulbrich, CEO of Volkswagen China Technology Centre (VCTC). Just like Audi’s AUDI brand, Volkswagen is teaming up with Chinese brands to create models that meet the needs of the Chinese market – as well as the pace. With that in mind, these three concepts are the first of many: ‘Over the next three years, we will bring out more than 20 state-of-the-art NEVs alone with forward-looking technologies to cater to all our different customers in China,’ said Stefan Mecha, CEO of Volkswagen passenger cars brand for China. ‘With our “In China, for China” strategy we will now realize our full potential and demonstrate our innovative strength at local level.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
56,Hunting Pumas: new Jaecoo 5 arrives with Evoque-ative look,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jaecoo/5/,Jake Groves,2025-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Jaecoo, the new brand from China that’s recently launched in the UK, has just unveiled its next car at Auto Shanghai 2025. This is the 5, a new battery-electric crossover that’ll stand in a field of all the other battery-electric crossovers already on sale. It’s designed to take on all sorts of rivals from around the world, including the likes of the , and even the new . So, what’s Jaecoo’s party piece? As it turns out, it’s seemingly making the 5 look like a – albeit seen from a distance. Like the larger , the 5 shares some design details like shallow rectangular headlights, a large rectangular grille and relatively clean surfaces. But the shape is very like JLR’s baby Rangie, including the two-tone roof line and rear end. Inside, it’s all relatively conventional. There are shades of Ford Explorer and BYD Atto 3 in the overall look, with a large central portrait screen that flows up from a high centre console. The singular image of the interior we have includes a car with white leather upholstery. Performance specs? Er, well, besides a targeted range of around 250 miles… that’s about all the info we have. However, given Jaecoo is another brand within the Chery group that runs alongside Omoda, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the Jaecoo 5 shares a lot in common under the bodywork with the . That means a single 201bhp e-motor, a circa-seven-second 0-62mph sprint time and a charging speed of around 80kW. Jaecoo has, however, confirmed that the new 5 will come to the UK, with the first deliveries coming in August 2025.

57,Denza Z concept: BYD's luxury brand goes sporty,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/denza/z-concept-sports-car/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Denza has revealed its new first-ever concept sports car just weeks after its official launch in Europe. Revealed at Auto Shanghai it’s the first foray into performance for , though not the first for BYD overall – its off-shoot makes the huge U8, but also the jumping, eye-wateringly quick U9. Called the Z, Denza says it has a ‘Pure Emotion’ aesthetic with styling features such as a ‘Quantum Pulse’ face and Light Blade waistline. Take a glance though, and there’s clear notes of Lotus Emira, Lamborghini Gallardo – and potentially even a bit of Alpine A110. Not the worst company, mind. Either way, it’s very different to those cars underneath, and uses a mixture of new features alongside those from the we’ve already driven. The standout feature is a fully self-developed chassis-by-wire system, which uses software and sensors to control everything from the steering, braking ,powertrain and the suspension. Called DiSus-M, the suspension can adapt each corner of the car depending on road conditions. It’ll essentially scan the road ahead and then instantaneously firm up the suspension as required – a bit like Rolls-Royce’s Magic Carpet system. The Z’s steer-by-wire system has also been developed in-house and uses no mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and front axle. And because this is a concept car, it folds up too. Finally, the Z also uses the same e3 platform as the Z9 GT – a key part of Denza’s brand offering. That means it gets a three-motor independent drive powertrain and rear-wheel, dual-motor independent steering. In real terms, that means it’ll be incredibly powerful, possibly available as a hybrid, and have party tricks such as the ability to crab walk and ‘swing’ itself into tighter car parking spaces. How useful those features are, though, remains to be seen. The e3 platform also benefits from Vehicle Motion Control which is essentially ESC and Cell-to-Body integration, which provides a stiffer, more compact skateboard chassis on which to build. The Z is just a concept car for now, with Denza unable to comment on a production-spec car. Throw in the fact Denza isn’t bringing every car of its worldwide range to Europe, and we wouldn’t bet on seeing the Z on UK roads. Still, it’s good brand building for BYD’s luxury arm.

58,New Range Rover Electric unveiled + we’ve been for a ride in it!,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/range-rover/range-rover-electric/,James Dennison,2025-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"Range Rover has gone electric. It’s been a long-time coming, but the British brand has finally made an EV version of its flagship SUV. In a year when even Ferrari is set to announce its first electric vehicle, Range Rover’s latest model comes not a moment too soon and looks set to build on the 140,000 (including Sport) models shifted each year. As well as gathering key early details, we’ve also been for a passenger ride in a prototype version of the Range Rover Electric and seen what it can do during winter testing in Northern Sweden. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the new Range Rover Electric. ‘It’s a Range Rover first, EV second.’ That’s the internal party line, anyway. According to Thomas Müller, JLR’s product engineering boss, the EV version doesn’t replace anything—it complements it. ‘The customers should choose the best powertrain for a Range Rover that he or she wants to drive’. However, both Müller and Vehicle Engineering Director Matt Becker claim it’s their top pick from the lineup. Why? Because the electric powertrain’s smoothness and serenity match the luxury character more naturally than a thumping V8 ever could. Range Rover isn’t planning an all-out migration to battery power just yet, though. With 80% of current buyers living in regions facing imminent combustion bans, the Range Rover Electric is an addition, not a revolution. And yes, petrol and diesel versions are sticking around. In classic Range Rover fashion, the Electric version doesn’t look like it’s trying too hard. Visually, it’s 99% identical to its ICE siblings, right down to the MLA platform and production line in Solihull. Müller puts it plainly: ‘People buy Range Rover because it’s a Range Rover. They won’t buy it just because, first of all, it’s electric.’ The most noticeable styling difference is likely to be around the front grille where the differences in cooling requirements between EV and ICE means a revised design is possible. However, it’s worth noting that on our prototype car a 3D printed placeholder was used before the design is finalised. We joined Becker at JLR’s winter testing facility for a sideways jaunt across a snow-packed handling circuit, and despite its expected 2.8-tonne kerb weight, the Range Rover Electric (on all-season tyres) acquitted itself admirably. The centre of gravity is a good 50–60mm lower than the V8 Range Rover, meaning it can run with softer anti-roll bars and remain composed. Dual-rate springs, revised damper valving, and anticipatory software all keep it flat and balanced—even during the heavy acceleration granted by 627lb ft of torque. Range Rover is tight-lipped on the final spec, but we know a few tasty figures: 542bhp, 117kWh usable battery, 300-mile range, 0–62mph in around 4.5 seconds. Expect a starting price similar to the V8 at around £170,000. Underneath, two electric motors (having four would be less efficient, heavier and not as effective) drive both axles, using clever torque vectoring logic to manage grip. JLR’s Integrated Traction Management (ITM) can respond to slip in 50 milliseconds—around 100x faster than a traditional system. We saw this in action up a steep slope where the right-hand side wheels were on ice and the left-hand side on tarmac. Despite having almost zero grip on one side, the car was able to claw its way up, managing traction across all four wheels. Admittedly, a petrol Range Rover could deliver similar end results, but the ease of use and control granted by faster responding electric drive units was hugely impressive. In summary, early impressions suggest Range Rover has done a fine job taking its halo model into the age of electric. The execution appears well thought out and the engineers are right in that the level of serenity and quiet (afforded by the EV powertrain) does work beautifully with the car’s luxurious character. If the price tag is indeed around the £170k mark, customers will however have a straight choice – V8 petrol or full EV. And in that respect, our only concern would be whether the electric powertrain feels special enough to warrant its price tag. After all, it’s easy to sell the benefits of a V8 over a regular engine, but much more of a task to differentiate a premium EV powertrain.

59,A clean Slate: new American brand launches simple EV truck for £15k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/slate-truck/,Jake Groves,2025-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"Introducing Slate: the new automotive brand that’s just launched in the US with its first vehicle – a super cheap, super customisable electric truck. The new brand, which is a start-up that’s been backed by the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has gone public with its new EV that’s designed to bring things back to basics. Its look is thoroughly retro, with clean surfaces and functional design details. Its size is retro, too, with Slate saying its base truck is more akin to something like a pick-up from the 1980s, rather than the behemoths we see on the road today. Slate’s CEO, Chris Barman, is also pushing affordability with the brand’s new truck. ‘The definition of what’s affordable is broken,’ he says, adding that the ‘radical truck platform is so customisable that it can transform from a two-seat pick-up to a five-seat SUV.’ And it can – albeit with something Slate is calling a ‘flat-pack accessory SUV kit.’ Better get your Allen keys out. That also allows for an immense amount of customisation, with Slate dreaming up a range of kits and looks from the base platform. It really is designed to be as simple as possible, with details like steel wheels, manual roll-down windows and physical switchgear inside are all included. As for infotainment, Slate simply provides a mount for your phone. The truck is all-electric, with a right-sized battery for the platform – a 52.7kWh pack with a 201bhp electric motor on the rear axle. Slate says this model is targeting a 150-mile range. If that’s not enough, a larger 84.3kWh pack will be offered, nudging peak range up to 240 miles. Slate will make its trucks in America – which will certainly – and says that the entry price for the truck will come under $20,000 after federal incentives. That’s £15k to us in the UK.

60,Sayonara to the zen garden of the car world,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lexus/goodbye-to-lexus-ls/,Stephen Bayley,2025-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"► To understand Lexus, start with Sony. Only people old enough to remember The Beatles’ first LP will recall that ‘Made in Japan’ was once a stigma, not a guarantee of quality and refinement. Sony changed that. Its founder, Akio Morita, had vision and guile. Just when Western Electric declared there were no commercial uses for the transistor its labs had invented, Morita found that, indeed, there were. Rather profitable ones, in fact. Additionally, he had the wit to know that Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo was difficult for Western tongues and ears, so he invented the name Sony, happily suggesting both ‘sound’ and an affectionate name for a male child. And he eradicated Japan’s reputation for shoddy products by committing to ingenious, continuously innovative technology and sophisticated design which set a world standard. Refusing to discount, he said: ‘We are selling diamonds.’ Never mind that it has now more or less abandoned hardware to concentrate on cinema and gaming, ‘Sony’ remains an eponym for premium-priced excellence. This is where Toyota wanted to be. Lexus came into existence in 1989, soon after the Toyota Corolla had become the best-selling car of all time. The ambition was now to build not just the world’s most popular car, but the world’s best car. But, unlike VW, its predecessor in that popularity role, the Corolla did not represent any form of ambition in technology, design or driving experience. It was a blameless, therefore emphatically dull, little car whose chief attribute was reliability. Cars perform bravura tricks in the theatre of our imaginations, but very few people let their imaginations wander into concepts of service intervals and MTBF (mean time between failures). Desire is the thing. Toyota wanted to engineer desire with a glamorous large car. No one wanted a big Corolla, so Toyota invented a premium brand. The name Lexus simultaneously suggests the concepts of the ‘regal’ and ‘luxury’ which, I suppose it’s fair to say, is what many large-car buyers want. The original Lexus LS had a shape explicitly inspired by the W126 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, especially in matters of proportion and the curves around the C-pillar and the nose profile. Originality in aesthetics was not in the plan, although the LS was a far more advanced proposition than Toyota’s existing large car, the Century. This is the one you still see in Tokyo with lace antimacassars on the back seat and a driver with white gloves. Its appearance resembled a full-size American car of the early ’60s. But the Rekasasu, as it was known in Japan, could make claims of its own. The goal of serenity had been a target for the engineers. Perhaps they had a Zen tea-room in mind. Unusual quality too. It was claimed that the electrical connectors were gold because that metal’s conductivity was specially high. There was more from Toyota’s busy Department of Myth-Making. People said there was a Lexus test-track somewhere in Japan where the surface rose by exactly 1cm in the course of a kilometre to replicate the curvature of the earth. Precision was king, even if that king was not fully dressed. I drove an early LS and was astonished to the point of blinking by the powertrain. Noise and vibration were almost imperceptible. You could hardly tell if the engine was running. Pressing the accelerator produced a nearly silent rush of well-mannered energy as if a million synchronised angels were giving you a shove in the back along an endless channel of greased roller-bearings. And it wafted along as though those same angels had commandeered a leather-upholstered waterbed. Of course, switches and secondary controls were superlative with no lost motion and disciplined graphics. The stereo was by Nakamichi, the caviar of audio. And now the LS has been withdrawn from sale in the UK, leaving Lexus with a range dominated by five SUVs, as humdrum in their way as the Corolla used to be. Fact is, they were always Toyotas. Another fact is: only three Lexus LSs were sold in the UK in 2024. What we are seeing here is not just a failed experiment by Toyota, but a larger story of the endgame of the three-volume format. The story of Lexus is a threnody for the saloon, a car type belonging to the age of cufflinks. Individual customers for large saloons no longer exist in significant numbers: they are bought mostly by chauffeur businesses. Lexus has a brand problem too. The thing with brands is that they cannot be created just like that. You have to wait. Brands are a promise. They are a bit like religion since they require belief. Nurture your product for long enough and it will eventually acquire the positive associations and pleasing expectations that define ‘brand values’. The LS was not nurtured and then found itself on the wrong side of history. In this sense, Lexus has failed. Once it was selling diamonds, but no longer. Sony is out of the game it started, so too is Lexus."
61,Petrol & Pride: a new car enthusiast event for queer community planned for 25 July,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/petrol-and-pride/,Jake Groves,2025-04-28,Car Magazine UK,"Petrol & Pride, a new car event on the horizon, is designed to celebrate car culture and queer culture for both members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies alike. The new enthusiast meet-up is the first of its kind, and is planned for 12:00 midday on Friday 25 July at the British Motor Museum – conspicuously in Gaydon. … etc. will be based in the grounds and car park of the museum, with the aim for enthusiasts and allies of the queer community to share their passion for cars by showing theirs off. As well as meeting new car enthusiasts, the event is hosting a competition for the best Pride-themed cars, which will make up a display in the car park. A prize will also be awarded for the most colourful car. ‘Many car companies have been working hard to promote and demonstrate inclusion and belonging in their workspaces, despite and because of the external challenges facing us,’ an event spokesperson tells CAR. ‘However why we are doing this is being increasingly questioned in the news. Some of our colleagues are feeling unsure, which just means we have to work harder.’ The event is ‘for all car enthusiasts that are members or allies of the LGTBTQIA+ community – and there are lots of us – to show our collective love for and pride in both our cars and each other,’ says the spokesperson. ‘We hope it will be a great afternoon out with the most colourful and eclectic collection of cars yet assembled in the UK.  And lots of new friends made, too.’ As well as the car meet, event-goers will benefit from free museum entry and the chance to grab a bite to to eat via some of the paid-for food vendors that will be on site. Interested? Event organisers say it’s best to register your attendance in advance as soon as you can, otherwise entry will not be free.

62,Citroen’s new C5 Aircross is an electrified sofa on wheels,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/c5-aircross/,Jake Groves,2025-04-29,Car Magazine UK,"Citroen’s new C5 Aircross has arrived. The brand’s biggest SUV has been thoroughly overhauled for a new generation, introducing all-new tech on a new platform and a choice if electrified power options. Unsurprisingly, a lot of the production car’s design comes from the concept that was shown at the 2024 Paris motor show, even including the green colour the car launches in. That said, Citroen has told us that the green won’t actually launch with the real production car, so you’ll have to wait a bit if you’re interested. Still, though, the new Aircross SUV is a step in a new direction for Citroen design, looking to move the brand’s look away from squishy and cuddly and more angular and techy. Citroen is going for big sofa energy inside, making sure all of its Advanced Comfort bits and pieces are front and centre. The ‘zen lounge’ aesthetic ( , Citroen…) includes the brand’s super soft seating. As well as the seats, Citroen has equipped its Advanced Comfort suspension, too, with hydraulic bump stops over physical ones for better bump absorption. As for the cockpit itself, the C5 Aircross features a high centre console with wireless charging pads and cupholders, as well as the new ‘cascade’ infotainment screen. Citroen claims that it’s the largest ever fitted to a Stellantis car (not necessarily a good thing, Citroen…) with fixed sections for things like climate control and customisable areas for the bits you use the most. On top of that, Citroen also includes a 10-inch instrument display for the driver, and a head-up display. As for family space, Citroen says the wheelbase of the new C5 Aircross allows the same knee room as those afforded in the back of , and 51mm longer than that of the outgoing C5 Aircross. The new C5 Aircross uses the same STLA Medium platform as cars like the latest and . That effectively allows Citroen – like Vauxhall and Peugeot – to hedge its bets when it comes to powertrain choice. That means the new C5 Aircoss comes with a mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid options, as well as multiple battery-electric choices. First up, and representing the entry-level option, is the C5 Aircross Hybrid 145. This model has a 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine mated to a small e-motor and 0.9kWh battery pack located under the front seats. Power is fed to a six-speed dual-clutch transmission to the front wheels. Next up is the Plug-in Hybrid 195. Here, a 1.6-litre turbo is mated to a much beefier electric motor – one making 123bhp – integrated into the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, as well as a 21kWh battery pack. Here, Citroen claims up to 53 miles of engine-off battery range. Two battery-electric models top the range, named 210 Standard Range and 230 Extended Range. The 210 model has a 73kWh battery pack and a 281bhp e-motor, with Citroen claiming a 323-mile electric range. The more powerful 230 version has a 97kWh battery and claims a 422-mile e-range. A couple of points worth knowing about the EV versions, though. First off, a heat pump – very handy for regulating battery temperature, increasing range – is still optional on any spec below Max. Our advice is also to perhaps wait until 2026 to buy an EV version; from then, electric C5 Aircross models will come with faster AC charging (11kW over 7kW, optionally upgradeable to 22kW) and will come with vehicle-to-load technology that can power devices. Citroen says the C5 Aircross will go on sale after the summer, and is expected to launch in the UK in the winter of 2025. Prices aren’t confirmed yet, but they’re expected to be competitive compared to the likes of cars like the , and .

90,Why car makers think drive-by-wire is the future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/drive-by-wire/,Jake Groves,2025-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"What do cars like the , a and most of Ferrari’s line-up have in common? They’re all production cars that use ‘drive-by-wire’ technology – engineering and software that enables control of a car’s movement without the need for a physical engineering. The technology area has seen an increased amount of focus recently, with many car makers investing millions in research and development – or are working with suppliers that are doing the very same – to figure out how best to apply the technology to its cars. Drive-by-wire technologies have multiple applications and, it seems, appeals to car brands of all types – from ones that make performance cars to luxury ones, as well as those focusing their efforts on future automation. Hence why Tesla’s beastly pickup comes pre-built with steer-by-wire tech, while Lexus is offering it as part of its performance-focused RZ F-Sport model. Bosch, meanwhile, is engineering its own proprietary by-wire technologies and is testing them on the road, with CEO Stefan Hartung telling CAR: ‘by-wire technology is a complexity management tool, because it takes that complexity away.’ Fellow German supplier to the automotive industry, ThyssenKrupp, is also heavily investigating by-wire functions and says the tech is ‘on the verge of a breakthrough.’ Ferrari is a whole leap further forward – using brake-by-wire tech in the , , and – and almost all new cars equipped with automatic gearboxes use shift-by-wire tech. The main identifying factor of drive-by-wire technology is that it removes most of the physical engineering usually associated with controlling a car. Think components like steering columns and the systems they’re connected to, hydraulics and lines for braking and throttle systems and so on. Steering and braking systems, for example, are instead connected digitally via wiring, processors and software. Removing physical components allows for two benefits straight away: a reduction in weight and opportunities for better packaging. Many automotive engineers agree that the weight loss is relatively negligible, however, with the opportunity to package interiors better becoming a much more useful opportunity for engineers and car designers. This use comes into focus more when designing electric cars and vehicles with more automation, enabling more spacious interiors complete with steering wheels that fold away into the dashboard when a car is driving autonomously. A car with a physical steering rack, by comparison, wouldn’t be able to do that so adeptly. Christoph Starzynski, head of vehicle development at Mercedes-Benz adds: ‘From a packaging perspective, you don’t need a right-hand drive or left-hand drive version of your components, so from a pure manufacturing complexity perspective that’s an advantage.’ Car makers also see this as a benefit when it comes to engaging with the car’s infotainment. ‘In combination with Level 3 conditionally automated driving, [steer-by-wire] will enable an even more immersive entertainment experience in the medium term,’ says Mercedes tech boss Markus Schäfer. ‘That’s because the flat steering wheel provides a better view of the display when streaming your favourite show, for example.’ And that neatly takes us on to our next point: the reduction or customisation of driving effort. Some car makers that are actively pursuing the use of the technology, already have it available or produces cars with its pre-installed are more likely to use a yoke-shaped steering wheel. As well as improving the view of the car’s interior screens, many steer-by-wire systems are calibrated to reduce the amount of turning of a steering wheel required, where a full turn of the wheels requires little actual steering effort. Reducing effort and providing more precise control is exactly why Ferrari has its own brake-by-wire technology in cars like the SF90, 296 and 12Cilindri. ‘The technology allows us the pedal feel that we want when using the same hardware, meaning we can fit in a GT car, a sports car or anything else,’ says Ferrari vehicle dynamics project lead, Jacopo Canestri. ‘We can break the rules of a standard system with servos because you have leverage in that system; to send more power to the brakes you need more stroke. With by-wire, we can choose less stroke but still have the power we want.’ Francesco Comand, a Ferrari development driver, agrees: ‘it gives us complete freedom at the calibration phase. I believe that this technology, together with ABS Evo in our cars, are two of the most important innovations in braking since carbon ceramics.’ As well as reducing effort, some car makers are investigating its customisability. Ben Payne, vice president of design at Lotus, says steer-by-wire technology can enable a level of personalisation not possible with conventional systems. ‘Because it’s all software driven, you can tune the ratios, the speeds, the feedback… everything,’ he says. ‘You can go from town driving where it’s super light and giving you just enough feedback to track driving with minimal lock for that proper race car feel.’ Given there are cars that already feature steer-by-wire or brake-by-wire that are on sale now, we’re already inclined to say yes. Even so, the technology has taken years to be refined to the point it is now, with some cars having it in the past and failing to take full advantage. Infiniti, for example, and it was widely panned for its poor calibrations. More recently, though, CAR has been privy to testing emerging ‘by-wire’ technologies. For example, three years before it made official production, we were one of the first to test . The system was designed to reduce the effort required for low-speed manoeuvres and eliminate any vibrations drivers would normally get through the steering wheel. We’ve also had some seat time in several Bosch development mules, testing both steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire technologies. Bosch has been developing a customisable steer-by-wire system that changes the amount of steering effort based on what drive mode you’re in. It’s also engineered a brake-by-wire setup that uses a fixed pressure pad instead of a conventional pedal; it’s a slightly weird setup, but one we got used to quickly as it presented a level of braking precision and response we’d not experienced before. One of the biggest areas of concern is cybersecurity. Naturally, given the car’s fundamental controls are being handed over to software and digital platforms, that can present the opportunity for someone to potentially hack into a car and control it remotely. Data from analytics provider Upstream, secured by the Institute of the Motor Industry, points to rapid increases in automotive cyberattacks in 2023: around 35 per cent of attacks focused on telematics data and apps, but 14 per cent targeted electronic control units in cars – devices that will be needed to control by-wire systems – and it’s a growing metric. ‘We are extremely, repeat… sensitive to subjects like cybersecurity and confidentiality and making sure the user remains in control,’ Pascal Ruch, head of Lexus Europe, tells CAR. ‘One thing you can really believe us on is that there will never be any kind of compromise there, and we will ensure zero risk.’ There is also, of course, the disadvantage of simply not having that physical connection. While there are many failsafes and dependencies in by-wire systems that can give the user peace of mind, some engineers still see it as a risk in certain circumstances. Engineers in Toyota’s Gazoo Racing divison, for example, don’t see any benefit in using a by-wire system; ‘one of our priorities is to keep the connection in a high-performance vehicle,’ says GR engineer Hiroyuki Yamada. More than anything else, though, there is the simple point of whether it’s all that necessary. ‘From a customer’s perspective, there are some advantages for by-wire technology and we’re participating in this kind of technical development,’ says Starzynski, ‘but only time will tell us when the customer is actually ready for it. That is always the question.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

63,Citroen ‘doesn’t need’ and ‘doesn’t know how to sell’ big luxury cars anymore,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/citroen/d-segment/,Jake Groves,2025-04-29,Car Magazine UK,"Citroen’s global CEO, Thierry Koskas, has confirmed there is no intention to replace , which was designed to be its flagship car. The Citroen C5 X sits in what’s classed as the ‘D-segment’ of the car market, which means it goes up agsinst plenty of premium rivals like the , , and . However, executives at Citroen have said that it will no longer occupy that space due to slow sales, with taking the mantle as the French brand’s largest and plushest car. For reference, the C5 Aircross is classed as a C-segment SUV. ‘This kind of car, the C5 X, was not a success for us,’ says Caroline Malleus, Citroen’s product and strategy director. ‘We see that people in this segment are looking for more luxuries and premium brands, so this is not a targeted segment [for Citroen] anymore.’ Koskas agrees, saying: ‘The C5 Aircross is supposed to be our flagship at the end of the day, which means I don’t think that Citroen has much to do with the D-segment where we are with C5 X. It’s not selling too badly in the countries where we sell it, but it’s such a tight segment – as soon as you enter the D-segment, you go along with the premium brands [i.e. Mercedes, Audi, BMW etc.]. Mainstream brands in the D-segment are very much anecdotal.’ ‘With C5 Aircross, it’s probably the most advanced and best car we have, it’s packed with technology, super comfortable,’ Koskas adds. ‘I don’t need something bigger, and I’m not sure how to sell something bigger. It’s a good idea to stop with this big baby [i.e. the C5 Aircross].’ In fact, Citroen is already in the process of winding up C5 X production. Citroen UK has confirmed in a statement that ‘right-hand drive production of the Citroën C5 X will conclude at the end of May 2025. Existing orders will be fulfilled, and stock will remain available while supplies last. ‘Citroën already offers a range of seven electric passenger vehicles in the UK, with five available for less than £30,000, and later this year, Citroën will launch New C5 Aircross and New ë-C5 Aircross as the brand’s flagship models in the UK, offering electrification, comfort, and practicality at an affordable price. More exciting products and services launches will follow, reinforcing Citroën’s commitment to innovation and accessibility.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

64,The new Renault Trafic - a funky electric van that isn't from a Chinese start up,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/trafic-estafette-goelette/,Tom Webster,2025-04-29,Car Magazine UK,"The Renault Trafic range is heading in two opposite directions, with this all-new set to go on sale alongside the existing diesel model. The all-new Trafic E-Tech is just part of the story, though, as Renault is also releasing two other interpretations of its medium-sized van using the same platform. These are called the Estafette and the Goelette and all three have made their global debut at the 2025 CV Show at the NEC in Birmingham. They share the same basis, cabin and battery, with different versions planned to launch in the coming year. The Trafic will continue in the same mould as the ICE version, and will be purely a van to start off with. It will be sold as a panel van and a crew van to start off with, and there will be two lengths and one height on offer. The Goelette might have a different name, but it is basically a Trafic with a different back. So if you want a more spacious box body, a dropside or a chassis-cab model to turn into, say, a fridge van then it will be a Goelette rather than a Trafic, even though the two are identical from the B-pillar forwards. Finally there is the Estafette, which is a much taller and funkier looking van that is aimed squarely at the urban delivery market with a door in the bulkhead that allows the driver to walk through from the cabin to the loading area. This is the model that was previewed at the 2024 IAA commercial vehicle show in Hannover. The Trafic, and its siblings, all sit on the same skateboard-style platform, which allows for flexibility and so many versions of the vehicle. There will be two lengths of Trafic E-Tech – the L1 is 4.87m and the L2 comes in at 5.27m – but only the one height to start off with. It sits 1.9m tall, in order to slot under the average urban car park restrictions. It’s 1.9m wide, which means it is fractionally shorter and narrower than the diesel Trafic, and it comes with a slightly smaller loading bay as a result – the shorter one is 5.1m3 while the longer is 5.8m3, which is the same as the smaller version of the current Trafic. The other handy dimension is the turning circle, which is the same as the Renault Clio’s at 10.3m. Design wise, it gets a few smart features and some geared at practicality. The illuminated Renault logo is a first for one of the brand’s commercial vehicles for example, while the lower half features plenty of black cladding to better deal with building-site bumps. This will be standard to start off with but expect there to be some colour packs in the future to allow you to get your bumpers in the same shade as the rest of the vehicle. The Goelette might have a different name but it is basically a Trafic, albeit an entry-level one. IT takes its name from a model sold for a decade from 1956, which was also designed to be easy to convert. The cabin and front end are identical in layout and design to the Trafic, and there will be several versions offered to start off with. This will include two sizes of box van, a crew cab with space for six and a chassis cab, which will allow buyers to put their own stamp on it. There will be more versions to follow too. The Estafette is very much a different van, though, standing much taller at 2.6m high. It’s the same length and width as the longer Trafic, though, at 5.27m long and 1.92m wide. The height means that it can offer a loading bay with 9.2m3 of interior room. It also uses that height to provide a door in the bulkhead between the cabin and the loading area that will allow a 1.9m tall driver to step through without stooping. This aids security and speed at delivery drop offs, as the driver can pick up smaller parcels without having to exit the vehicle. Renault has also designed the sliding side door so it can be operated using the driver’s elbow, allowing it to be operated while they have their hands full for example. The other bespoke features are the single-piece roller rear door, which lets the driver park closer to obstacles at the rear and still get in and out of the back, and running boards on either side. All three vehicles share the same three-piece windscreens that allow for greater visibility and a horizontal tube-style interior dashboard. There are closed storage areas and open ones on the top of the dash. They also feature a pair of digital displays, one being a 10.0-inch instrument cluster and the other a 12.0-inch infotainment screen that is angled towards the driver. As well as getting smartphone mirroring, it will also feature a commercial-vehicle-optimised satellite navigation system that should guide you away from lower height barriers or weight-restricted bridges. There will also be a dedicated software operating system, designed by Ampere. Companies putting their own conversions on the back of the Goelette will be able to integrate their operating systems into this – allowing you to control the temperature in a fridge van for example. It will also allow for regular and remote updates over the van’s life. In theory this will allow Renault to upgrade the vehicle over time, which will help protect the used values. All three versions are set to go on sale in the second half of 2026. With that launch date so far off it is too soon for precise pricing, but Renault says it will be ‘competitive.’ Given the Master E-Tech is priced similarly to its smaller rivals, this bodes well.

65,"Sharper, louder, lighter: the Ferrari 296 Speciale is for driving purists",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/296-speciale/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-04-29,Car Magazine UK,"► You’re looking at the 296 Speciale, a limited-run Ferrari aimed squarely at driving purists. Like the 458 Speciale or the Pista before it, the Speciale isn’t just about horsepower or headline stats – it’s about creating something even more agile, tactile, and importantly emotional for Ferrari Clienti. That’s not to say it isn’t fast: power is up to 866bhp, 0-62mph dispatched in just 2.8 seconds, and weight is down by 60kg. It’s the most powerful rear-wheel production Ferrari ever. ‘This special series derived from this donor car is not just an exercise where we put a few additional horsepower that we are doing, or we just reduce a little bit the weight that we are doing,’ said chief marketing and commercial officer, Enrico Galliera at the car’s launch. ‘We start creating a new concept. So, there is a reason for a client to buy this car, even if they already own the donor car.’ ‘Our book of strategy is very small, and it’s synthesised in this sentence: Different Ferrari for different Ferraristi,’ he continued. The 296 Speciale is ‘for pilots or for someone that knows how to drive, but while reaching a very high peak of emotion.’ Ferrari’s engineers have meticulously reworked the 296 in three key areas: power, weight and aero. The Speciale’s hybridised 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged V6 remains, but new software calibration boosts torque delivery during upshifts, allowing quicker, crisper gear changes.  Engine sound has been enhanced with a less restrictive exhaust system. So the 296 has a significantly louder engine note, with a richer bark both on acceleration and downshifts. Acoustic ducts have also been doubled to pipe even more natural engine sound directly into the cabin. Lightness was also a major focus. Ferrari has taken the regular 296 and subjected it to a diet of carbon-fibre. There’s more in the cabin, including a single-piece new door panel and a simplified transmission tunnel. Nine kilograms are shed from the engine alone, titanium springs, a carbon-fibre interior, an optional titanium exhaust and various optional bits of optional lightweight bodywork bring weight down further. Tick all the optional boxes, as most Ferrari Clienti will, and the Speciale will weigh just 1410kg – or 1460kg for the Aperta. At the rear FXX K-style vertical winglets combine with a revised active aero spoiler that is quicker to react than before. Up front, the Speciale benefits from less obvious aerodynamic features first seen on the 296 Challenge and GT3 cars. There’s a new front bumper, underbody and new diffuser, all of which work to reduce drag, increase aero grip and in some cases improving cooling. Brake performance is also improved by F80-style ducts that deliver air directly to the callipers. The 296 Speciale also gets an improved version of Ferrari’s ABS Evo system, allowing it to brake from 124mph to a standstill in just 106 metres. An uprated suspension with Multimatic dampers and titanium springs borrowed from the GT3 car keeps the car flat in extreme cornering and squat in heavy braking and acceleration. Made for a select few and available to even fewer, the Speciale won’t be made in limited numbers but will be available for a very limited time. The Coupe will be available to buy for active clients only (those who have bought a new or used car within the last five years), and the Aperta adds further hoops to jump through – along with a higher asking price to match them. Ferrari is making the Speciale available in an exclusive Verde Nürburgring too, following the recent trend for green cars. Those lucky enough to qualify will pay €407,000 (£346,000) for the Coupe (deliveries Q1 2026) and €462,000 (£393,000) for the Aperta (deliveries Q2 2026). Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
66,Meet the four-cylinder BMW M2 racer you've never heard of,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m2-racing/,Graham King,2025-04-29,Car Magazine UK,"► This is BMW M Motorsport’s new entry-level, factory-built race car, the Racing. It’s the first rung on a ladder that could conceivably take a talented driver through GT4 and GT3 to Le Mans Hypercars. And it’s powered by a four-cylinder engine. Wait, what? The road-going M2 has a six-cylinder engine, so why does the racing version have two fewer pots? Believe it or not, racing drivers are extremely cost-conscious, especially at the level the BMW M2 Racing is pitched at. Having loads of power is all very well, but it necessitates heavy-duty running gear that bumps up the car’s purchase price and costs more to replace. Big power burns through fuel and tyres more quickly, as well. Add it all together and a six-cylinder M2 Racing would be financially unviable. With a significantly less powerful four-banger, much of the M2’s standard running gear can be retained. That reduces purchase and running costs to a level that won’t make your wallet explode. Within a motorsport context, at least. Racing’s never cheap. The engine is the same 2.0-litre turbocharged B48 unit found in the BMW 230, lightly breathed on to produce 313hp and 310lb/ft of torque. That’s channelled to the rear wheels via a seven-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox with BMW M Motorsport’s own software. The 0-62mph time isn’t quoted, but a top speed of 168mph is. At 1500kg, it’s hefty for a race car but over 200kg lighter than the M2 road car. The M2 Racing uses the same wide-arch bodyshell and bumpers as the road-going M2. It also uses many of the same brake and suspension components, though the discs, pads, shock absorbers and anti-roll bars have been replaced with race-grade items. Elsewhere, there’s a full FIA-spec rollcage, seat and fuel cell, lightweight roof panel, quick-release bonnet and boot, and a plumbed-in fire extinguisher. It rolls on 10×18-inch forged alloy wheels with Goodyear tyres. There are race-tuned drive modes and 10-stage ABS. It even has aircon. Uniquely in the world of factory race cars, the M2 Racing will be built on the Mexico production line alongside every other 2 Series model. The whole package is designed so that the car is friendly to novice drivers, but can still be really quick in experienced hands. BMW works GT3 driver Jens Klingmann has been involved in the car’s development. He said: “Our focus was on ensuring that the BMW M2 Racing, with its combination of intuitive and predictable drivability and strong performance, is exactly the right car for all users, from the inexperienced participant at a track day to an ambitious racer. I am very satisfied with the result and convinced that buyers will have a lot of fun with the car.” Pretty much anywhere that will accept a production-based, 2.0-litre turbo, rear-wheel-drive coupe. And that’s of series. BMW highlights the Nurburgring Endurance Series – including the Nurburgring 24 Hours – the Crevetic 24H Series, TC France, the Benelux-based Belcar series and the Dutch Supercar Challenge. In the UK, you could run it Britcar and GT Cup, plus loads of lower-level club racing series. Trackdays, hillclimbs and sprints are in the mix, as well. Indeed, there’s so much you could do with the M2 Racing that it’d be possible to race one somewhere in the UK every weekend from April to October. This is actually the fourth generation of 2 Series-based race car. The first three were based on the F22-gen 2 Series; the M235i Racing was launched in 2014 and followed by the M240i Racing and M2 CS Racing. Though there was a one-make series, endurance racing became the cars’ prime stomping ground; there’s even a dedicated class for them in the Nurburgring Endurance Series. The BMW M2 Racing costs 98,000 euros before options and taxes. Well, we said motorsport isn’t cheap. Still, go endurance racing and you can spread the cost across multiple drivers. And it’s less than half the price of the next-rung-up BMW M4 GT4 Evo. It’ll be available through selected BMW M Motorsport dealers who start taking orders in June for delivery ahead of the 2026 racing season.

67,Midlands topples Maranello: new Aston Martin DBX S has more power than a Purosangue,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/dbx-s/,Jake Groves,2025-04-30,Car Magazine UK,"The curious case of SUV one-upmanship continues as Aston Martin launches its new DBX S flagship. With 717bhp, the new all-out SUV manages to be ever-so-slightly more powerful than a . Aston Martin says the DBX S is the latest in a long line of S cars which started with the DB3 S in 1953. Tenuous link to history aside, the new performance SUV sounds like a tasty mix to take on the Ferrari. The power boost has been achieved by using -spec turbo upgrades including a larger compressor wheel diameter to squeeze out that extra shove over a – already an incredibly fast SUV, and one of our favourites. The new DBX S sprints to 62mph in 3.3 seconds and tops out at an unchanged 193mph. It’s not just power, though as the DBX S has gone on a diet. Aston says it’s shed up to a total of 47kg – with optional lightweight packages making up the most of that. Choosing the carbon seats, for example, shaves off 18kg while another 19kg can be removed by choosing the optional magnesium wheels. Carbonfibre body panels and a rear wing can remove 7kg, too. S models are spotted by vertically-stacked exhaust pipes, and you can spec a bespoke S livery that trims the lower edges of the car. The new DBX S model marks the start of new(ish) boss Adrian Hallmark’s intentions for Aston Martin to make more variants and editions of its cars. He says it ‘sends a powerful statement of intent about our ambitions not just for DBX, but for the Aston Martin brand.’ Fancy one? You can order it now, with the first deliveries coming towards the end of 2025. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

68,Michael Leiters steps down as McLaren Automotive boss as merger with Forseven finalises,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mclaren/michael-leiters/,Jake Groves,2025-04-30,Car Magazine UK,"Michael Leiters has stepped down as head of McLaren Automotive, as the supercar brand goes through some of the biggest structural changes in its history. Leiters’ departure has come into force with immediate effect. In case you missed it, McLaren Automotive has merged with automotive start-up Forseven into a new business named McLaren Group Holdings. The new company is the result of CYVN Holdings – an Abu Dhabi-based investment company – completing its acquisition of McLaren Automotive, as well as a non-controlling stake in McLaren Racing. Leiters led the Automotive division, having years of experience being the technical chief at Ferrari and managing enormous projects like the development of the Cayenne in his formative years in the industry. The merger will have significant and likely lasting effects on McLaren’s future product portfolio, given Forseven’s technology developments that will likely be integrated into future McLaren products. While we’re speculating, the change in management may have had something to do with Leiters’ departure. Even so, while Leiters has been at the helm, the supercar brand has developed a broader line-up of cars like the , , and . ‘I am honoured to have led McLaren Automotive over the past three years,’ says Leiters in a statement. ‘I am thankful having worked alongside such a dedicated and talented team. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved together and confident that the business is on a strong path for success. I wish all involved the very best in the future.’ New McLaren Group Holdings CEO Nick Collins will manage the Automotive division as well as his responsibilities at Group level. Collins has decades of experience in the industry, working for years at Ford of Europe, becoming executive director of vehicle programmes at JLR before being CEO of Forseven pre-merger. ‘We thank Michael for his leadership and tremendous contributions made during a pivotal time for McLaren Automotive,’ says Collins. ‘I wish him well in his personal and professional future.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

69,We test Hyundai’s cyberpunk X-ble Shoulder wearable robot tech,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/hyundai-x-ble/,Jake Groves,2025-05-01,Car Magazine UK,"‘ ’ sounds like some sort of B-movie sci-fi thriller you’d watch at a drive-in theatre. But engineers at Hyundai have crafted robotic technology that isn’t far off that, making such a thing no longer the imaginative ramblings of a science fiction novelist. This is the X-ble Shoulder, a wearable vest equipped with braces around your arms. It’s designed to support those in physically demanding jobs – and is just the start of a range of robotic inventions Hyundai is working on that goes far beyond cars. CAR was invited to become a test subject for the technology, and experience how it can work for those who really need it. Yes. First of all, the automotive giant owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics. If you’re not familiar with Boston Dynamics, that’s the company that makes those spooky, yellow four-legged robots that can act like dogs, carry packages and more. Boston Dynamics is also rather famous for those videos doing the rounds on social media of bipedal robots doing parkour to test how ambulatory they are. However, more recently, Hyundai has created its own robotics laboratory based in Seoul. The brand’s own efforts at its Robotics Lab range from automotive themed projects to service robots and wearable technology seen here and service robots. For example, the robotics lab itself already uses small service robots that ferry mail around the building. It’s also trialling a robotic device that plugs in your charger for you in a tightly packed bay parking space at an EV charging point; extremely useful for the disabled who increasingly feel overlooked regarding how charging stations are designed. An area of particular focus, though, is wearable robots. Correct. The X-ble Shoulder is one of three articles of wearable robotics that Hyundai plans to officially produce. The aim for the Shoulder model we’ve tested is to relieve the user from some of the stress of raising their arms regularly in physically demanding roles and ones that demand a lot of what’s defined as ‘overhead work’. Hyundai says that includes roles in construction, marine and automotive manufacturing, agriculture and logistics. Two versions of X-ble Shoulder are being produced. The basic one ‘is designed for tasks where the human posture continues to change,’ according to Hyundai, and offers up to 2.9kgf of assistive force. An ‘adjustable’ one is designed more for helping those who repeat the same movement, providing 3.7kgf – think of someone doing the same process for several hours while working in a car factory, for example. The tech itself is attached to a washable vest, and can be deconstructed easily for maintenance and cleaning. The structure is made from a carbon composite material, and uses something called a ‘non-powered torque generation structure’ that generates power from the wearer’s movements, and means it doesn’t need charging. Hyundai says the X-ble Shoulder ‘can augment the user’s upper arm muscle strength and reduce the burden on the upper musculoskeletal system,’ and is designed to enhance worker safety, reduce injuries and make the task at hand more comfortable. The engineering team claim X-ble Shoulder ‘can reduce shoulder load by up to 60 per cent, and anterior/lateral deltoid muscle strain by up to 30 per cent.’ This is the first bit of wearable tech out of a series of three that are being developed, with Hyundai planning it for imminent commercial sale after years of trials and testing. The second bit of tech is named X-ble Waist. That system is worn around your hips and is meant to augment your legs, relieving strain for those who regularly bend down or crouch in their job. SiHyun Joo, head of robotics & intelligence at Hyundai’s Robotics Lab, tells us: ‘the X-ble Waist is still at the research stage, while X-ble shoulder is ready for sales – they will start soon.’ The third is X-ble MEX, which is a much more elaborate leg brace set-up designed for the walking impaired. Hyundai says the aim of the MEX technology is to aid in the rehabilitation of those with mobility impairments, and with a MEX set already in use at the Seoul Asan Hospital. ‘While the Shoulder and Waist are designed for the worker and to help improve productivity, MEX is all about rehabilitation for patients,’ says SiHyun Joo. If you think the Shoulder kit is designed to help you lift something several times your weight like some sort of superhero, I’m afraid it doesn’t quite work like that. I’ll admit that was my expectation, too – but it didn’t help me lift an like it was a bag of crisps – bummer. You put it on just like wearing a gilet, which makes sense given it is basically a breathable vest with some mechanics strapped to it. Then you need to attach the arm braces, which are wrapped tightly around your biceps. Given there are no powered electronics, there’s no need to power it on or wait for it to activate – it’s live and reactive the moment it’s strapped to you. Initially, it’s a very surreal experience. The moment you move your arm, the assistance quickly responds. It’s not intrusive or overbearing, but you do know you have something attached to you and that it’s responding promptly to your movements. I performed a task that would represent what a real owner would do: working in a car repair shop, removing and attaching bolts to the underside of a Hyundai Ioniq 5. To that end, it didn’t mean I could relax my arms while the robotics propped them up. Instead, it provided support. Holding my arms up above my head for the job absolutely was made easier, with the X-ble tech providing just enough force to relieve the strain on my arms but still allow me to remain in control of my own movements. The overall intention is better wellbeing for the manual worker, reducing the prevalence of the associated health problems and injuries that can come from such work. Hyundai has also pointed to that highlights that wearable robots and ‘exoskeletons’ will grow from a $3.37bn business in 2025 to one that’s worth $13.52bn in five years. It does feel a bit -ish as a project, mind you. Bearing in mind that – in countries like Korea and Japan – ageing populations mean people are having to work longer. Technology like this can certainly ease the strain and keep people working longer – which certainly makes it a beneficial, albeit short-term, solution for businesses exactly like Hyundai Group that conveniently operates in sectors where tech like this would allow their workforce to remain productive for longer. That said, the Robotics Lab at Hyundai and Boston Dynamics are just two organisations that are pursuing a range of use cases for robotics. While some projects like automated taxis and delivery robots, may risk a loss of human workforce, others are designed to make life for humans easier. Treading that balance is going to become very significant in the years to come. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

70,Taking on the heavy mob: Kia's out for blood with its new PV5 electric van,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/pv5/,Tom Webster,2025-05-01,Car Magazine UK,"A Kia van? Yep, the manufacturer that has been turning out some class-leading electric cars is now going to take on the commercial vehicle industry and start making . This is the first of them, the Kia PV5, and it’s just made its UK debut in full production guise at the 2025 CV Show. Pricing starts from £27,645 (plus VAT) for the longer ‘L2/H1’ versions that are coming to market first and it includes lots of standard standard kit. This positions the PV5 as a great value choice, as well as one of the funkiest small van designs you can buy. The 247-mile driving range from the big battery variant isn’t too shabby, either. Based on a new E-GMP.S skateboard platform, this dedicated EV uses cell-to-pack battery tech for improved efficiency and allows a modular approach to the upper body. The S stands for Service, incidentally, as this evolution of Hyundai-Kia’s E-GMP underpinnings is exclusively for use by commercial vehicles. The first concept – that’s ‘Platform Beyond Vehicle, apparently Korean for ‘van’ – appeared at in 2024, and the models heading out to customers will share a lot with those initial versions. This means the funky S-shaped thin headlights that link up with the thin A-pillars, and sleek styling on the upper half of the body. It’s intriguing to see the new entrant’s design shaking up a traditionally very conservative sector. Though it’s also easy to mistake the PV5 for a larger van than it is, since it looks so different to other small vans such as the Citroen Berlingo and Renault Kangoo as a result. Van owners will be reassured by the core principles of the PV5, though, with the bottom half described as being a ‘robust, technical lower section.’ This is the area that will take the brunt of the hard life vans are subjected to. This includes a chunky set of black plastic wheelarches and bumpers with corner sections that can be independently replaced. Good news for those who suffer a bump on a building site, say. This is a front-wheel drive van, with a front-mounted electric motor and a choice of two battery pack sizes in the UK (a third, smaller 43.3kWh battery is not coming here). The standard range version packs 51.5kWh and a 119bhp (89kW) electric motor, achieving a WLTP rating of 181 miles per charge in Cargo form. The long range version has a 71.2kWh battery and a 161bhp (120kW) motor, and promises up to 247 miles WLTP. Both offer 184lb ft of torque, but as well as having a much greater driving range, the long range model is also significantly faster. It does 0-62mph in 12.5sec to the standard range’s 16.3sec – though it is notable that the times quoted are with a full payload. End of the day and job done, both will quirt you home through urban traffic pretty rapidly, we reckon. Speaking of payload – which is pretty important for small electric vans – the smaller battery gives you 790kg to play with while the larger battery is restricted to 690kg. That’s a competitive set of figures, further enhanced by the 4.4 cubic metre load volume. The pictures are slightly deceptive, we think, as in real life even the longer version of the PV5 is under 5m in length – shorter than a Berlingo XL – and there’s a smaller L1/H1 model coming as well. Boosting the amount of load space available still further, Kia will later add an L2/H2 High Roof derivative. The resulting 5.1 cubic metres of volume is greater than any mainstream rival small van. As per Kia, the PV5 has 400v charging – though capped at 150kW DC this is still enough to get 10-80 per cent topped up in under 30 minutes on the public network. AC wallbox charging at 7kW takes 7-10 hours for 10-100 per cent, with an 11kW connection dropping that to 5-7 hours. Kia’s gone for a modern modular interior concept that it refers to as ‘geometric’ in design. There’s a 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster plus a 12.9-inch central touchscreen, the latter running Android Automotive for app integration – a first for Kia – and plenty of storage. More unusually, there are at least five interior colours – including Navy Blue, two shades of brown and Iceberg Green – though we doubt all of them will make it to the UK options list. You will also be able to get ‘Kia AddGear’ accessories that will allow you to customise the interior even after the van has been purchased. Other neat features include an optional ‘L-track’ load restraint system (again maybe not for the UK) a walk-through bulkhead for two-seater Cargo models (ditto), and vehicle-to-load (V2L) power take-off that means you can use the drive batteries to power your tools. That is definitely coming to the UK, but will only be standard on the higher specification Plus trim level. The van won’t be the only PV5. Kia is also building a PV5 Passenger model. This features the same fundamental design as the van, but the latter has a more boxy profile, befitting its greater internal space. However, the PV5 Passenger shares the chunky protective elements on the lower half of the body while adding a huge amount of glassware on the sides of the vehicle, suggesting a light interior. Both have the same side sliding doors, but the rear doors are different. The passenger model gets a top-hinged opening that is handy for sheltering from the elements, while the van gets twin side-hinged back doors. The PV5 Passenger is fundamentally targeted at ride-sharing businesses, and apparently the design has had some input from Uber. Kia is now talking about a Prime variant aimed at private buyers, though, alongside a wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) and even a Light Camper. Five-seater PV5 Passengers will be available first, and Kia is talking about a 249-mile range and 0-62mph in 10.7sec from the 71.2kWh battery and 161bhp motor; the 51.5kWh / 119bhp powertrain will also be offered, promising 179 miles of driving range and 12.8sec 0-62mph. Top speed of all PV5s is electronically limited to 84mph. Seven-seater variants will follow later. The five-seater has a vast 1,320 litres of boot space, rising to 2,315 litres with the rear seats folded. Meanwhile, the Cargo model will spawn a (which we’ve recently caught testing). This will form the basis of a number of conversions including box vans and mobile fridges. A PV5 Crew van based on the Cargo will bring five seats and utility as well. Now that some UK pricing has been announced, the PV5 is certainly looking like a tempter – especially for anyone after their first electric van. The £27,645 cost of the core standard-range L2/H1 Cargo is subject to VAT, but also compatible with the higher-value – which will take £5,000 off the price at current rates. Kia is also promising attractive finance, and like all its vehicles, that money includes a seven-year / 100,000-mile warranty. Want the bigger battery? The long range PV5 Cargo costs from £30,145. What’s more, the basic Essential trim level is absolutely loaded with standard equipment, including two screen, automatic air-con, LED lights, front and rear parking sensors, reversing camera and stacks of safety kit. As mentioned, only the higher-spec Plus trim includes V2L, though, at a very reasonable extra cost of £910 (plus VAT). You also get wireless phone charging, heated front seats and steering wheel, and even more safety equipment. And if efficiency is your thing, only Plus variants get the option of a heat pump for an other £640 (plus VAT). Kia will sell the PV5 via a dedicated electric van dealer network – which is a smart move if it wants to be taken seriously by van buyers, as they require a different level of service with longer opening hours and appropriate courtesy vehicles. Roughly 60 locations are planned, and about 50 already confirmed. Not all of these will be at existing Kia dealer locations, so check before you travel if you want to see the PV5 in person when they start arriving in the UK late in 2025.

71,The best yet? Meet the 911 Carrera Coupe reimagined by Singer,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/singer-carrera/,Ben Miller,2025-05-02,Car Magazine UK,"The greatest 911? Tough call. But until today the answer was invariably that blended GT3 underpinnings with a cleaner, vaguely retro aesthetic. Unobtainable new and ferociously expensive now, the S/T is a beautiful little thug of a road racer. It’s also about as light as modern 911s get and uses a turbo-free 4.0-litre flat-six. Perfect, then, if a little big and digital in the modern style. Singer’s latest restoration service, the 911 Carrera Coupe reimagined by Singer Vehicle Design, looks set to change things – and most of us a new answer to the ultimate 911 question. Pitched somewhere between the modern and in remit, it too fuses a high-performance, analogue character with timeless 911 curves, sort of like Porsche’s S/T. It also uses a 4.0-litre flat-six with a six-speed manual ’box and ceramic brakes. And it too would be as mesmerising carving canyons as lapping Laguna. Only, being a restored 964, the Carrera Coupe service by Singer is both smaller and lighter than a 911 S/T, while offering scope for personalisation beyond Porsche can. And, sadly, Singer’s services are even more expensive. Every Singer commission is different, but a Carrera Coupe restoration will likely require a spare $1.5m/£1.12m, plus the donor 964 and taxes. Singer Vehicle Design exploded into the gearhead consciousness some 15 years ago with a restoration service retrospectively dubbed the Classic, essentially a type-964 911 pulled apart and rebuilt with a level of love, care and funding that allows for the very best of everything. In recent years, powered by the passion of main men Rob Dickinson (founder, executive chairman and creative director) and Maz Fawaz (chief strategy officer, with ex-Ford man Raj Nair now as CEO), Singer has gone supernova, upscaling its production facility (from authentic Californian hot rod shop to a vast facility with its own paint shop), establishing an ambitious engineering facility in the UK’s F1 belt and pulling together a dazzling collection of top-tier partners, including Williams, Brembo, Bosch and Red Bull technologies. Restlessly innovative, it took the flat-six engine to another level with the (all built) and services and introduced the ’70s 911 Turbo-inspired Classic Turbo as its main restoration offering, replacing the now closed-for-orders Classic. All of which meant that, for the first time, Singer found itself without a naturally-aspirated offering – a crying shame given the skills, technologies and engineering solutions it’d developed during the DLS, DLS Turbo and Classic Turbo projects, including state-of-the-art new Bosch traction and stability control systems, not to mention a six-speed Riccardo gearbox and new solutions to improve the stiffness and consistency of its restored 964 monocoques. Hence this car, the restoration service Dickinson and Fawaz consider the pick of their body of work to date: the 911 reimagined by Singer Carrera Coupe. The body and exterior design shares much with the Classic Turbo’s silhouette, albeit trading that service’s ’70s Turbo inspiration for a look that riffs hard on the rare wide-bodied Carreras Porsche offered in the ’80s while also incorporating Singer’s now-trademark stance, broad-hipped muscularity and artisanal attention to detail. And where the Classic Turbo restoration offers a modicum of refinement and touring ability, the Carrera Coupe is closer to Dickinson’s original mission statement for the Classic: ‘look great, be built like a Rolex and go down the road like a f*cking weapon.’ Deliberately rawer and more alive in character, the Carrera Coupe restorations are intended for fast road and track use – a ‘big-hearted, naturally-aspirated sports car’, limited to 100 units. As per Singer’s mission statement – ‘everything is important’ – the turbo-free flat-six is a work of art, technically and aesthetically. To see the thing, complete with its almost Art Deco cooling fan/intake plenum installation, is to wonder if the word ’engine’ might lack the scope to do it justice. Where the DLS restorations leant on Williams and its ability to deliver the savage revs and power required, Singer worked with Cosworth to hatch this new 4.0-litre motor. The specification is wild; like updating a Spitfire with autopilot, ram jets and onboard Wi-Fi: four valves-per-cylinder (for 414hp and a broad spread of torque), liquid-cooled heads with air-cooled cylinders, that six-speed gearbox (complete with DLS-style exposed shift linkage) and the promise of a soundtrack to shred your ears and swell your heart – all the way to 8000rpm and beyond. ‘Mature is the word that comes to mind for the engine and really for the whole car,’ explains Fawaz. ‘Development for the Classic Turbo service was comprehensive. We got into everything, and we approached this project using all of the collective things we’ve learned along the way. And with this engine we had very specific ideas of what we wanted to do with it. It wasn’t like we went to Cosworth, gave them a horsepower figure and asked them to sort it out. We want to do something very specific; very torquey for road use, very smooth, and we wanted the emissions controls [to make this a truly global motor] in place on every engine. Doing that while retaining the torque and the power… that’s when we decided to add variable valve timing. It’s not a new thing, of course, but it’s new for us.’ The cooling fan, being electric rather than belt-driven (it was developed during the DLS R&D), was free to be re-positioning, for better packaging and to more democratically cool all six cylinders. And while Cosworth set down the basic volumes and shapes for the plenums, Dickinson’s design team then massaged them into the Tate-worthy sculpture you see here, including subtly different curves to the two sets of runners to negate the cylinder offset and make the plenums symmetrical. The engine mounts into a monocoque restored to a level of rigidity appropriate for a car this fast and this focused. On top of Singer’s usual welding work, composite and steel reinforcements have been created in association with Red Bull Advanced Technologies and its world-class simulation and structural analysis facilities. Four-way adjustable dampers (remotely, from the cockpit), ceramic brakes and 18-inch centre-lock wheels mounting Michelin Pilot Sport rubber complete the chassis spec. Options include two styles of front end and rear wing – restrained or high-downforce; your call – a trunk for aero parts you’re not using that day, and auxiliary driving lamps that rise from the bonnet when required and fold down flush when not in use. The design was 18 months in the making, with Dickinson sweating all the stuff, big and small. And if this might just be his perfect 911 well, that’s probably no accident. And why not? This wild ride started with a car he built for himself, and that he could have sold scores of times over. Ideas that make his heart flutter will almost certainly do the same for Singer’s loyal client base. ‘Fifteen years ago, if you’d put a gun to my head and asked me what my perfect 911 would be, I’d have told you it was a normally-aspirated F model with muscular bodywork – flared fenders but without the more conspicuous aerodynamic stuff – that maybe tipped its hat to the ST from 1971,’ explains Dickinson. ‘Seventeen years on, as an old man of nearly 60, I‘d like to be sitting on corduroy [it’s an option, and it looks sweet] in something that’s fast, lightweight and punchy in the midrange.’ And now, for a fortunate few, Rob and Maz included, that dream will be made metal (and corduroy).

72,Kia EV6 slides under the crucial £40k barrier with new entry-level Air spec,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/ev6/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-02,Car Magazine UK,"The was facelifted in autumn 2024 and now the Koreans have brought a cheaper entry-level model to nudge the price of its electric family car below the crucial £40k barrier. The new EV6 Air comes with the standard-range 63kWh battery and rear-wheel drive to bring the starting price of the range to £39,235. Kia quotes a battery range of 265 miles and points out the lower-spec model also benefits from a lower insurance group rating (down to 29E). The 2024 facelift brought the availability of larger batteries, faster charging, a longer maximum range and a new front end that drags the EV6’s styling into line with the and revised . Prices did start at £45,575, so the Air represents a useful dollop of extra value. As before, the EV6 range is separated into three specifications. They’re called Air, GT-Line and GT-Line S – and they’re all exceptionally well-equipped. Even the entry-level model comes with automatic air conditioning, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a pair of 12.3-inch screens and a snazzy function that allows you to use the car’s battery to run equipment such as power tools and kitchen appliances. Step up a rung to the £48,575 Kia EV6 GT-Line and you’ll get a sporty body kit, adaptive LED headlights, rear privacy glass, a wireless phone charger and faux leather sports seats. The GT-Line S model, meanwhile, features 20-inch alloy wheels, heated outer rear seats, a head-up display and an arsenal of additional safety technology. You pay quite a lot more for the privilege, though. Prices start from £53,675. The entry-level EV6 Air Standard Range is only available with one powertrain. It mixes Kia’s new 63kWh battery pack with a single 225bhp electric motor on the rear axle. Kia says this system has a maximum range of 265 miles and can complete the 0–62mph dash in 8.7 seconds. The entry Air spec is also available with the long-range 84kWh battery if you need more range. GT-Line and GT-Line S cars come with the same powertrain as standard, although buyers can choose to upgrade to Kia’s more potent all-wheel drive system for a bit more money. This adds another motor on the front axle, boosting power to 320bhp and slashing the car’s 0–62mph time down to just 5.3 seconds. However, because both these cars use the same 84kWh battery, their maximum ranges fall to 339 and 324 mile respectively. Still, you can improve the efficiency of the GT-Line S model by splashing some more cash on Kia’s optional heat pump. Kia has also improved the EV6’s charging speeds as part of the 2024 facelift. Now, the car can accept DC charging speeds of up to 258kW. That’s a 7.9% increase over the pre-facelift car’s 239kW capability – and it means a 10–80% charge now only takes 18 minutes from a suitably rapid charge point. Other new features for 2024 include wireless and connectivity, an auto lock function if the key holder walks away from the car and an improved digital key function that’s compatible with more devices, including Google Pixel smartphones. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the centre console that’ll allow drivers to quickly load their driver preferences without poking around the touchscreen. Kia has tried to make the EV6 safer, too. Rather unusually, Kia has made the car’s B-pillars thicker, which the brand says has strengthened its body and should make it perform better in a crash. It’s also now fitted with all the latest EU-mandated safety tech, which includes a fresh driver monitoring system. First deliveries of the standard Kia EV6 arrived on UK shores in autumn 2024, but Kia is already making plans for the launch of its facelifted . That’s set to arrive in early 2025 – and we have it on good authority that it’ll nab some of its technology from its chassis sibling, the . Namely, that car’s clever simulated gearchange tech.

73,"Old-worlde charm, new-world tech: the Inverted electric Series Land Rover is here",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/land-rover/inverted-electric-classic-land-rover-series-4x4/,Tim Pollard,2025-05-02,Car Magazine UK,"The electro restomod scene shows few signs of slowing down and now buyers wanting the character of an old car with the electro wizardry of silent and clean electric propulsion have another option: the new Inverted electric classic Series Land Rover. Available on the Series I, Series II and Series III, it’s a conversion that’ll replace the oily bits of a classic Landy and shoe-horn in tried-and-tested electric motors, batteries and hardware to make dawdling around the estate, whizzing across the beach or cruising around country lanes a breeze. This conversion is done by Inverted, the new start-up based in Leicestershire and London that first came to our attention with the meticulous . Our review noted the high quality of craftsmanship on offer and praised the electric conversion, too. Here’s hoping Inverted has managed the same feat with this most iconic of all Land Rovers… The company is still in its infancy and works closely with potential clients to tailor each 4×4 to their every whim. The engineering process swaps out the combustion engine and fuel tank, replacing it with a 62kWh waterproof battery pack and a 160bhp electric motor which feeds a stout 664lb ft of torque directly into the transfer box, to retain all-wheel drive. The electric Series Land Rovers keep their low- and high-range ratios, as well as locking differentials, meaning the ageing icon should be able to retain its famous off-road prowess. All models come with power steering and a boosted brake servo to sharpen on-road manners. ‘Series Land Rovers are beautiful, iconic machines,’ says Harry Millington, founder of Inverted. ‘But let’s face it, not everyone wants to wrestle with a choke on a cold morning or breathe in exhaust fumes that waft through the car. Our electrified versions preserve everything people love about these classics while making them more fun, more reliable, and infinitely more usable.’ The battery can take charging at up to 60kW using the CCS standard. While hardly lightning fast by the standards of the latest , it does mean that 20-80% charges at a reasonable public charger should take just under 40 minutes. Inverted quotes a range of around 120 miles. Just make sure you don’t exploit the 8.0sec 0-60mph claim if you want to matc that – full-throttle antics will surely dent that range in the blink of an eye and we worry a little about how the ageing Series Landy chassis may take the full 664lb ft (900Nm!). Inverted will sell a restored and electrified Series Land Rover from around £125,000 plus VAT. Since we expect almost all buyers will be paying tax, let’s call it a nice round £150k. That includes the donor vehicle. If you already own a Series model and want to convert it, prices are available on request. Both left- and right-hand drive models are offered and all Inverted Series Land Rovers come with a two-year warranty and technical support.

74,"Money, power and politics: how Cadillac made it into F1",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/america-loves-f1/,Edd Straw,2025-05-05,Car Magazine UK,"General Motors is the latest major manufacturer to join Formula 1, but it’s been a tortuous journey. There are still twists and turns to be navigated before the ‘agreement in principle’ translates into the Cadillac-branded operation becoming first new team in a decade in 2026, but given the door has previously been slammed shut on an 11th this is a seismic shift. So what’s changed? Given the byzantine nature of the process, the answer is both a lot, and very little. The team applied for an entry when the application process for newcomers was opened by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem in January 2023, a unilateral decision against the wishes of F1 itself. The FIA is the regulator and F1 in this sense the commercial rights holder Liberty Media, which was concerned about the financial implications of adding an 11th team. The FIA approved the entry under the ‘Andretti Formula Racing’ name in September last year, but F1 rejected it for manifold reasons including the fact it wouldn’t be competitive or add value. The name change is significant. The project was created Andretti Global, headed by Michael Andretti, one of Indycar racing’s most successful drivers/team bosses and the son of legendary 1978 world champion Mario. It brought General Motors, using its Cadillac brand, on board to bolster its candidacy, but it wasn’t until Andretti moved into a purely advisory role that the entry was approved. When it was, there was no mention of Andretti, with F1 referring to it as GM/Cadillac. Despite the identity change, this is exactly the same outfit now presented as a GM team run by a company called TWG, headed by CEO Dan Towriss. TWG owns Andretti Global, which will design, build and race the cars. GM is now in control, but it’s a joint venture even though the only obvious Andretti connection is Mario’s place on the board. GM has referred to the entry as Cadillac Formula 1. There’s now the small matter of finalising the fee GM must pay to enter, which will rise from the current $200 million to a potential $450m or perhaps even more. This is an anti-dilution fee, shared between the existing 10 teams to offset the impact of F1’s prize fund being split 11, rather than 10, ways. The amount will be formalised in the new commercial terms, the famous Concorde Agreement, which kicks in for 2026. The position of the teams is summed up by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner’s ‘we’d have absolutely no problem with seeing GM coming in, but we’re not paying for it’. Setting aside the political machinations, GM must climb a mountain for its team to be competitive. Top teams employ 1000-plus people in state-of-the-art facilities and a base of expertise built up over decades. GM’s advantage is despite the uncertainty, Andretti pressed on with building up its staff and facilities in the expectation F1 would relent and give it the green light. A significant factor was the US Department of Justice anti-trust investigation opened in August, but which can now be parked. The team always expected the threat of this to result in F1 letting it in. GM/Cadillac has recruited shrewdly, appointing Graeme Lowdon, sporting director of the Virgin team that raced in F1 under several names from 2010-2015, as team principal. It has also brought in three of the key players in the Benetton/Renault F1 team’s championship successes in operations director Rob White, executive engineering consultant Pat Symonds and technical director Nick Chester. In total, GM has 280 people working full time, mainly on design and development in its Silverstone facility. That number will swell over the next year with the establishment of the race team and other key departments. GM has achieved what once seemed impossible by getting on the grid. But now the hard work begins. Edd is a highly respected motorsport journalist and broadcaster.

75,Mean and green: new 2025 Jeep Compass launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jeep/compass/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-05,Car Magazine UK,"Jeep has its work cut out. The brand is navigating an ever-more environmentally conscious market that’s perched on the edge of an electric revolution – but it’s spent the last 80 years forging a reputation in the combustion-powered off-roader market. As new starts go, this is a tough one. But Jeep has tried to set off on the right foot. It’s already launched the to tackle the growing – and now, it’s introduced an all-new for the mid-sized SUV market. That’s a good move, because the class already accounts for 25% of all European car sales. This new Compass also has quite the reputation to uphold, at least for Jeep’s accountants. Previous versions of the car have sold more than 2.5 million examples worldwide since the nameplate was introduced in 2006. Luckily, Jeep has been able to bring the third-generation Compass to market quite efficiently, thanks some help from its parent brand Stellantis. It’s based on a modified version of the group’s STLA Medium platform and it shares its engines and electric powertrains with the . Scroll down to find out more. Everything. It has a fresh platform, a new range of engines, a completely different chassis setup and a bold new design language that follows in the footsteps of the smaller Avenger and Recon SUVs. As before, Jeep says it designed the Compass to be capable off-road. The standard car has approach, breakover and departure angles of 20, 15 and 26 degrees respectively. That’s not enough to worry a , but it isn’t bad for a car that’ll spend most of its time crawling around town. It’s also designed to take a bit of a beating. That massive black plastic front bumper, for example, is made from scuff-resistant material – and if you batter it beyond recognition, it comes off in one piece for easy maintenance. The front fog lamps are also set back into deep sockets to help prevent them from being punctured by rocks or branches. The new Compass is cleverer than the previous model, too. Jeep has packed it with intelligent features, including a raft of aerodynamic trinkets that help slash its drag coefficient down below 0.3Cd. These include an active shutter for the front grille, a flat undertray and ducts behind the wheel arches that help expel turbulent air. It’s better packaged, too. It now measures 4.55 metres long, making it around 15cm longer than the old car. In addition, Jeep has pushed the car’s wheels out to the extremities to liberate an extra 55mm of rear legroom. You also get 550 litres of boot space, which is an enormous 112 litres more than the old car, and there’s a new 34-litre storage bin in the front of the cabin. To round off the improvements, Jeep’s upgraded the Compass’s technology. You now get a huge 16-inch infotainment system that houses basically all the car’s functions. I’m not a huge fan of that, but at least you get some shortcut buttons along the bottom of the screen to let you quickly jump to important settings, such as the climate controls. There are just three remaining physical controls on the centre console – a rotary gear selector, a parking brake button and a massive drive mode selector to cycle through the car’s terrain settings. Jeep thought it was important to have that last function on a physical switch, but I’d have much rather had a proper fan speed knob. Like almost every other car under the Stellantis banner, the Compass is available with both petrol and electric power. You have a choice of two hybrid systems and three electric powertrains, all of which Jeep is still being rather secretive about. I’ll break down everything we know about them so far. The cheapest option is a 143bhp 48-volt mild-hybrid unit, which I suspect will use a modified version of the ’s 1.2-litre three-cylinder powertrain. Above that is the same 192bhp plug-in hybrid system you’ll find in the . Jeep hasn’t yet told us how efficient either system is or how far the PHEV can travel on electric power alone. Moving on to the EVs, there are two front-wheel drive options (with either 210bhp or 227bhp) and a sole four-wheel drive model with a whopping 370bhp. Crucially, Jeep states the latter system can develop a monumental 2286lb ft of torque at its rear wheels thanks to a clever 14:1 gear reducer. Jeep says this innovation makes the new Compass great at going up hills. Apparently, it can claw its way up a 20% slope. However, if my experience of the same reduction tech in the Avenger 4xe is anything to go by, I’ll need to try it before I can trust those claims. More importantly, the Compass’s 74kWh battery offers a maximum claimed range of 400 miles, while a 20–80% charge takes just 30 minutes when you hook the car up to a 160kW DC rapid charger. You also get an on-board 22kW charger for at-home top ups. You can order one now in Jeep’s First Edition trim. It’s available with either the 143bhp mild hybrid system or as a 210bhp EV. Standard equipment includes 20-inch alloys, Matrix LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a rear parking camera and a panoramic sunroof. Jeep hasn’t yet released a full price list, but the cheapest Compass is expected to start from around £36,000. There are more versions of the car on the way, too. Jeep will soon launch an off-road ready Compass 4xe that features 10mm taller suspension, knobbly tyres and a tougher body kit that improves the car’s approach, breakover and departure angles to 31, 16 and 27 degrees respectively. That trim will only be available with the four-wheel drive EV powertrain.

76,New CLA: ‘benchmark’ baby Mercedes arrives with 492-mile EV version,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/cla/,Jake Groves,2025-05-08,Car Magazine UK,"Meet the new entry into life with a Mercedes-Benz: the latest CLA. The latest generation of Merc’s streamlined small luxury saloon debuts with a new vision, new platform and new raft of technology designed to rewrite the rules of what a small Mercedes should be. A lot of the new tech and engineering on the CLA has either been inspired by or a direct result of learnings from – the wild, super streamlined technology development car that managed 1000km on a single charge. ‘Mercedes wouldn’t be Mercedes if it wasn’t pushing the limits,’ smiles chief technical officer, Markus Schäfer. ‘We’re a competitive company, and we’re transferring our learnings from EQXX to [the CLA]. With this final product for this segment, you’ve got extremely high charging times, ultra-competitive consumption… we’re on a benchmark. I don’t know of too many cars that can reach this,’ he tells CAR. The range will begin with the CLA 250+ with EQ Technology in Sport Edition at £45,616 with the sportier AMG Line Edition retailing for £49,375. After that, things top out at the AMG Line Premium Edition, which will cost £51,770. It does, yes. That part of the new CLA’s recipe – the design – we’re the least convinced about. Gorden Wagener and his team haven’t gone full soap bar this time like the and , but there is still some predictably rounded-off detailing. Naturally, a lot of the car’s overall silhouette is very similar to the that came before it. Three-pointed stars can be seen in the headlights and rear light clusters and, for the EV version, the ‘grille’ is illuminated with 142 individual LEDs inset into it. Every model features a panoramic glass roof as standard. The new CLA is 35mm longer, 25mm wider and 29mm taller than the outgoing version, with Mercedes claiming some space improvements for occupants. The boot is smaller than before (405 litres, compared to the outgoing car’s 460), but the EV versions make up for this by adding a 101-litre frunk. Two trims are confirmed: Progressive Line and AMG Line, with the latter providing sporty 18-inch wheels and a more athletic look. We likely suspect that only AMG Line will make it to the UK market as it has done with other Mercedes models; us Brits like big wheels and body kits… for better or worse. You can add to that with a Night package that blackens some of the trim, while AMG Line Plus throws in even more sporty details. How could you tell? Mercedes, as always, is going big on technology – offering a level of software and digital engineering the Saloon and can only dream of. The basis of this new technology is the new Mercedes Modular Architecture that underpins the CLA and more models to come. ‘With MMA, you’ll see a lot of new technology,’ says Schäfer, ‘the video, the audio, the full-scale immersive experience for the driver – that’s pretty impressive with such a car, one that’s offering so much for this segment.’ What dominates in the launch imagery is an enormous, full-width dashboard panel that incorporates three screens: a 10.25-inch driver instrument cluster, a 14-inch central display and another 14-inch passenger display. It’s a layout that’s been heavily inspired by the EQXX concept, and Mercedes calls it the MBUX Superscreen – the same name used in a similar piece of tech available on the E-Class. The Superscreen is an option that’ll launch a little later; standard CLA versions will come with the more conventional two-display setup. Mercedes’ steering wheel – the one that’s usually riddled with touch-sensitive buttons – remains, but the brand says it’s been simplified for the new CLA. And, naturally a big part of all this screen tech is so Mercedes can provide the digital software to make the most of it. The CLA is the first car to launch with Merc’s new MB.OS software, with the MBUX infotainment being the front-of-house overlay you’ll use. The MBUX Virtual Assistant uses , relying on ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing for internet searches, as well as Google’s Automotive AI, for the most educated and natural responses possible. And, instead of using its own Mercedes system, the CLA launches with Google Maps built in. A glut of driver assistance tech is included, with Mercedes putting its own spin on a few features. MBUX Surround Navigation, for example, is described as something that ‘seamlessly integrates the driver-assistance view with a 3D representation of the surroundings and route guidance in real-time on the driver display. Drivers benefit from improved situational awareness, seeing what the CLA sees and how the assistance systems support them.’ Yup. Just like all the tech inside, a lot has been enabled by that new MMA platform. There are two electric power specifications at launch: the CLA 250+ and CLA 350. Both have that very clunky ‘with EQ Technology’ suffix on them (just like the electric G-Class) as the brand begins to away from naming its electric cars EQ-something-or-other. Both the launch variants come with an 85kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery pack. We also know Mercedes is preparing an LFP (lithium iron phosphate) option to lower the price, but that may be for other markets or will launch later. For now, though, your entry into electric CLA life is with the 250+. Here, a single electric motor on the rear develops 268bhp and 247lb ft, allowing this model to sprint to 62mph in 6.7 seconds and onto a top speed of 130mph. Mercedes claims a WLTP range between 431 and 492 miles on a single charge depending on spec, making this one of the longest range EVs on the market. Choose the 350 4Matic and, as the name implies, a second e-motor joins the party on the front axle for all-wheel drive grip. Power and torque jump to 349bhp and 380lb ft, while the 0-62mph sprint time drops to 4.9sec. Here, Mercedes says the CLA 350 claims between 418 and 479 miles. Those lofty range claims, according to Mercedes, are down to serious attention to detail when it comes to efficiency. Its latest motors can run at 93 per cent efficiency and use technology from the EQXX, for example, while the e-motor on the rear axle features a two-speed gearbox (much like a or ) that’s designed to improve motor efficiency at higher speeds. ‘The drive units will also be scalable,’ says Christian Pfeffer, project lead for electric drive systems at Mercedes-Benz, ‘so don’t be surprised if you see these land on bigger cars from us.’ The battery-electric powertrain uses an 800-volt architecture, which is lighter as well as allowing for faster charging – up to 320kW on DC fast chargers. Merc says that means up to 201 miles of range can be added in 10 minutes. And, because it can, the electric CLA versions feature bespoke (and customisable) sounds like ‘fractal fusion’ and ‘granular fuzz.’ Think up your own buzzword sound experience names in your own time. The electric CLA variants are also primed and ready for bi-directional charging, also known as vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home. Mercedes says it will activate the tech at a later date via an over-the-air software update. Correct. For the CLA and its wider family, Merc has developed an all-new engine, codenamed M252. It’s a 1.5-litre four-cylinder unit, designed to be used as part of a non-plug-in hybrid system, and is mated to an equally new eight-speed ‘e-DCT’. The engine is smaller and 17 per cent lighter than the outgoing four-cylinder used in the current A-Class and CLA and, with a 1.3kWh battery pack under the driver’s seat, provides a system that can be super-efficient for those who aren’t quite ready for electric yet. Mercedes hasn’t yet confirmed the exact specs of the combustion engine CLA versions as they are planned to join the range after the EV. However, CAR can confirm the engine outputs will be 134bhp, 161bhp and 188bhp – likely badged CLA200, CLA250 and CLA300 ‘We feel you’re reaching diesel-level efficiency with this hybrid system,’ says Mercedes powertrain engineer, Karsten Krebs, as he points out the system can provide several miles of engine-off propulsion. So much so that Mercedes isn’t offering a PHEV – so confident is it that the hybrid is efficient enough and the BEV is usable enough. ‘We think the hybrid is the best combination we can offer for those who aren’t completely ready for electric,’ says transmission engineer Jan Becker. ‘If you have the option to charge anyway, then the electric option is what you should go for,’ adds Krebs. We’ll find out a launch date soon, but the new CLA will launch in the next few months. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

77,Inside YASA: the Cosworth of e-motors,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lamborghini/v12-of-electric-motors/,Ben Oliver,2025-05-09,Car Magazine UK,"‘ If you worry that Britain no longer produces brilliant engineers of the Frank Whittle variety, meet Dr Tim Woolmer, and YASA. Lamborghini has just announced that the new Temerario will use YASA’s brilliant, tiny, lightweight electric motors in its hybrid drivetrain, but the impact of what Woolmer is creating might go far beyond high-priced hypercars. For more than 200 years we’ve known that there are two basic types (or ‘topologies’) of electric motor. There’s the ubiquitous radial-flux design, which is cheap and easy to produce and which powers everything from your Tamiya to your Tesla. It looks a bit like a sausage roll: the magnetic flux flows radially around the stator (the pastry) acting on the permanent magnets in the rotor (the sausage), causing it to turn. You know what a conventional electric motor looks like, and if you can’t quite picture how the electrons flow, there are plenty of animations online. In 1821, Michael Faraday demonstrated the first example of the other kind of electric motor: the axial-flux or ‘pancake’ design. Here the stator and rotor are both discs, sitting next to each other with the shaft passing through the middle. The current flows through the stator axially, or in line with the shaft, acting on the permanent magnets in the disc-shaped rotor alongside it, causing it to turn. The advantages of this design are legion. Because there’s more surface area for magnetic interaction and most of it is generated with greater leverage at the edges of the discs, an axial-flux motor can produce much higher torque for a given weight. Because the hot bits aren’t buried in the pastry, it can be cooled more easily and can operate at a higher percentage of its peak output for longer. And that pancake shape has obvious packaging advantages in any application but especially cars, where it can be slipped between a combustion engine and the gearbox in a hybrid, or even into the wheels of a pure EV. The trouble was that nobody could work out how to mass-produce an axial-flux motor, until Woolmer came along. He saw that they would be perfect for electric cars, devoted his Oxford PhD to making them work at scale, and within five weeks had cracked the problems that had stumped everyone else for two centuries. His solutions include (but aren’t limited to) getting rid of the heavy iron ‘yoke’ which previously held the stator’s copper coils, further reducing weight and bulk and allowing a rotor to be placed on either side; an oil-cooling system for the copper coils through which the current flows; and the rather beautiful, jewellery-like design of those coils, which are edge-wound from flat copper wire around cores of soft magnetic composite and sit in the stator like the segments of an orange. The firm he founded to put his ideas into production – YASA – sounds exotic, but stands for ‘yokeless and segmented armature’: essentially just a description of what he invented. This was back in 2005, and in those pre-Tesla times there was little demand for EV motors. But as the market has grown exponentially, and Woolmer’s designs have grown in power, shrunk in size and taken shelter behind what he describes as ‘a thicket of patents’. Look at the YASA and Tesla motors on Tim’s desk and axial’s advantages are immediately obvious: YASA’s current design is around a quarter the depth of the Tesla motor, half the weight and makes twice the torque. It’s also a far neater, better-resolved design than the Tesla: a classic example of something looking right because it is right. It’s still expensive though. YASA first supplied prototype, racing or very low volume road cars such as the Jaguar C-X75, Koenigsegg Regera and the Lola-Drayson electric land speed record car. In 2019 the Ferrari SF90 became first standard-production car to get a YASA motor, followed by the 296 GTB. The Lamborghini Revuelto hybrid uses two on the front axle to assist its V12, and the Temerario adds a third on the rear axle. Lambo’s forthcoming full EVs will be entirely YASA powered. McLaren is also reported to be a customer. The biggest beneficiary of Woolmer’s tech is likely to be Mercedes, which bought the company outright (but excluding Evolito, his aerospace division) for an undisclosed sum in 2021. YASA now employs 500 people in the UK, and will continue to supply the supercar makers from a plant near Oxford which can now make 25,000 motors each year after a £12m investment. But Mercedes will start building them in the hundreds of thousands for its AMG.EA platform at a new plant in Berlin. Axial-flux motors might give a new generation of all-electric AMGs the engineering distinctiveness which we all feared might be lost in performance cars in the EV age. Other than the packaging flexibility, the compounding effect of mass reduction means the 100kg saved by the motors themselves is at least matched by what can then be saved elsewhere in the car: in the battery especially. But the greater benefit might come from what Woolmer does next. YASA is developing motors of around 225kW – or 300bhp – weighing just 7kgs. That’s less than a conventional brake disc. Put that motor in the wheel – as the Mercedes Vision One-Eleven concept did in 2023 – and there’s no increase in unsprung mass, so no effect on the ride or handling of the car. But the weight savings really start to multiply: no driveshafts, possibly no gearbox, and if the law is changed, no conventional friction brakes either; the electric motors doing as effective a job of shedding speed as creating it. Radial-flux motors won’t be rendered obsolete, of course. Rimac and Lucid in particular are making huge strides in the power density of their motors, which are hardly disadvantaged by being shaped like sausage rolls: Aston Martin gave Lucid a stake in the company in return for access to its tech. Axial-flux motors are likely to remain relatively costly and lower-volume, and their most dramatic impact might not be in automotive at all. Aerospace companies will pay way more to cut weight than carmakers and the compounding effects of weight loss are greater. Evolito is developing extremely expensive, lightweight axial-flux motors which could produce a colossal 50kW per kg, and which might enable practical, affordable, short-hop electric flight. If that happens, the comparisons between Woolmer and Frank Whittle might be more than academic. Ben is one of the most respected voices in the motoring space and writes for a number of titles in the UK and at leading automotive publications around the world."
78,New Volvo estate? Forget it,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/volvo-estates-forget-them/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-12,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo’s is simultaneously the spiritual successor to the , and the closest thing to an estate Gothenburg has made in years. But it’s neither saloon nor estate, and nor is it a high-riding crossover – that’s the job of the it shares a platform with. We might want it to be a saloon and we might want that saloon to spawn an estate variant, but Volvo says that just not the way the world works any more. Our misty-eyed nostalgia for estates doesn’t materialise where it counts, on the balance sheet; estates just don’t sell in sufficient numbers. In an increasingly competitive market, Volvo must bank on what works: cars that combine everything we want, and models that are big on volume but low on cost. ‘It’s expensive to bring different models to the market, and it’s expensive to keep those models in the market, and it’s expensive to launch them from a marketing point of view,’ Volvo ex-CEO Jim Rowan explained to us the ES90’s launch. ‘This is why we started doing things like having a XC60 – it’s big selling car for us – rather than bring in a V90, for example. We’re making very conscious choices about where we want to play the game. ‘Where do we differentiate? SUVs with a nice, high ride height and very, very safe,’ he says. ‘We think we can protect that beachhead against the competition. It’s much easier than us becoming too distracted with too many models. ‘We’re a single brand company, Volvo, that’s it. And we do 30, 40, 60 and 90 – so we have a nice stack. We do SUVs, sedans and wagons at the moment, and the question is do we renew all of those?’ Design chief Jeremy Offer is very clear that the ES90 does not fit in with conventional idea about saloons. ‘It is in a class of its own. It’s got a long wheelbase, pushing those wheels into the corner of the car, short front and rear overhangs.’ But look again and you’ll notice a jacked-up ride height that puts it somewhere between a normal saloon and an SUV. Look harder still and you’ll discover it’s not a saloon at all – but a hatchback. ‘It is fundamentally a large sedan, but with these sorts of nuanced changes that we enable,’ Offers confirms. ‘This is about really fundamentally understanding our users and our customers,’ Offers says of the ES90. ‘I think part of the beauty of having a complete kind of paradigm shift in terms of how we think about the automotive experience,’ he adds. ‘It’s enabled us to sort of tear up the rule book a little bit, quite honestly.’ In the same way that consumer demand has blurred the lines between Apple’s laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and demand is now pushing Volvo’s designers to think past traditional body styles. So say goodbye to the classic Volvo saloon and estate. The shift to electric powertrains is also a big factor in the change of body style, with the batteries under the floor. The 800-volt ES90 uses the same SPA2 platform as the EX90 and Polestar 3, but is first to get dual Nvidia Drive AGX Orin chips. The ES90 is ‘the most powerful car we have ever created in terms of core computing capacity,’ says Anders Bell, Volvo’s chief engineering and technology officer. ‘This allows us to further raise the bar on safety and overall performance through data, software and AI.’ So committed is Volvo to its unified strategy that it’ll be retrofitting early ES90 and Polestar 3s with the new chips and installing them to later models from the off. The benefits are clear: Volvo can reduce hardware and software fragmentation and increase the efficiency of updates, just like Apple does with iPhones, iOS and M-processors. Volvo has battened down the hatches and is sticking to its robust eight-model by eight-year strategy for the moment. And soon all EVs will be on the SPA2 and SPA3 platform, making the cars that do make it off the drawing board easier to update over the air. Rowan’s pragmatic approach leaves less room for the competition to erode its market share or consumer base – but also less room for the estate we think we want. ‘We’re in a Darwinian event here where it’s tough, and there’s all these tariffs and stuff like that. So, the guys who figure out quicker are going to come out strong.’ Whether that direction will change under new CEO Håkan Samuelsson remains to be seen. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
79,ReadyAware: the Harman tech that works like car-to-X without the expensive hardware,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/harman-readyaware/,Jake Groves,2025-05-12,Car Magazine UK,"Harman, the wholly owned subsidiary of Samsung, seems to have solved one of the biggest problems with car-to-X technology – the need for expensive hardware – with its ReadyAware system. ReadyAware is just one of the projects under Harman’s ‘Ready’ umbrella of technology developments, which is designed to give the modern connected car much more situational awareness of what’s ahead of it or what’s on route. This comes in the shape of alerts and messages given to the driver via the car’s infotainment and instrument displays. Most of those behaviours sound quite familiar if you use something like Waze – the mapping software that also alerts you of traffic, broken down cars or roadworks ahead. But ReadyAware also includes alerts like (the unlikely event of) a wrong way driver, bad weather affecting road conditions or even something more instantaneous like someone applying their brakes very hard or reversing ahead of you. It’s the kind of use case that’s perhaps the most beneficial from the whole subject area of car-to-X technology: where your car would communicate and pool information with other cars or infrastructure in the vicinity like traffic lights or dot matrix gantry signs. Instead of requiring additional or specific hardware that requires a car to communicate with civil infrastructure or other cars from different brands, Harman claims ReadyAware can be installed into a modern car’s in-built systems and use the suite of sensors and cameras already at the car’s disposal. However, unlike a conventional map service with driver alerts (like Waze), the driver wouldn’t need to report that information themselves. ReadyAware uses the car’s already-installed sensors and cameras – as well as driving inputs like steering or brake inputs, or whether the traction control has to intervene – to log potential alerts to other drivers entirely via Harman’s ‘Situational Awareness Engine’ (SAE) that’s housed entirely in the cloud. All a car would need is a 4G or 5G connection and enough processing power to run the ReadyAware technology – two criteria that are both largely commonplace in new, connected cars. ‘If a vehicle has to talk to another vehicle, or talk to infrastructure, it’s usually always hardware dependent,’ says Hanieffa Mohamed, project manager for the ReadyAware technology. ‘What we’re doing here is 100 per cent software. ‘There are already loads of control modules in cars, so we can install this software in two control modules – the domain control unit [DCU, used to process data and make decisions when using automated driving systems] as well as the head unit [for the infotainment.’ Mohamed says the tech can be integrated into an Android or Linux-based operating system and can help car companies score that seductive five-star EuroNCAP rating. The SAE analyses driver data and will build a ‘confidence score’ with the information. That score will rise if other drivers react to the same event and a pattern is found in the corroborating data, leading to ReadyAware making drivers further down the road, er… aware. The Ready suite of products is designed to be an off-the-shelf bundle of hardware and/or software that car makers can install into their future cars. The idea is that Harman effectively takes almost all of the time and cost out of software development – a part of building a new car that is taking up more and more of both. In fact, Harman already claims to have 50 million vehicles on the road today with either its audio technology (like its Harman/Kardon premium systems) or connected car tech equipped. And, even if it’s not Harman technology, it’s a rarity these days that a car isn’t in some way ‘connected’ to the wider world. Which is the case Harman is arguing as to why car makers should work with it, rather than create their own versions. As for when it’ll actually hit the market, we’re not entirely sure. Harman says the technology is ready now but, given it will need to work with OEMs and install it in future cars, that could still be a few years away.

80,US tariffs: UK trade deal drops levies on cars and steel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/us-tariffs/,Ted Welford,2025-05-13,Car Magazine UK,"US President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariffs on trade are continuing to have worldwide effects, even as the United Kingdom and the US announce a trade deal. The UK-US deal crucially includes details surrounding the automotive industry, including a drop in tariff from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, which will apply to a quota of 100,000 UK cars. The deal also includes a reduction in the 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium down to zero – a boon for the UK’s ailing metals industry. ‘My government has put Britain at the front of the queue because we want to work constructively with allies for mutual benefit rather than turning our back on the world,’ says Prime Minister Kier Starmer. ‘I am delighted that eight decades on, under President Trump the special relationship remains a force for economic and national security.’ Adrian Mardell, CEO of JLR, added: ‘The car industry is vital to the UK’s economic prosperity, sustaining 250,000 jobs. We warmly welcome this deal which secures greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports.’ However, the news hasn’t gone down well elsewhere. American Automotive Policy Council president, Governor Matt Blunt, issued a statement saying: ‘The U.S. automotive industry is highly integrated with Canada and Mexico; the same is not true for the U.S. and UK. We are disappointed that the administration prioritized the UK ahead of our North American partners. ‘Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts. This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers. We hope this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors.’ ‘What we are going to be doing is a 25 per cent tariff on all cars that aren’t made in the United States,’ Trump said while at his desk in the Oval Office when initially announcing the measures in February 2025. ‘We started off with a 2.5 per cent base – that’s where we’re at – and we’ll go to 25 per cent.’ Trump says enacting these tariffs will mean ‘incentivising companies – and even countries – to come into America and build.’ On top of that, the President announces that his government intends to offer interest relief on those looking to buy a new car that’s US-made. ‘If you borrow money to buy a car, you will be allowed to deduct interest payments for the purposes of income tax, but only if the car is made in America.’ Not well, to put it mildly. Some car makers ended up temporarily halting deliveries of cars to the US, including Audi and JLR. Production of other models like the Lotus Emira slowed due to ‘globally sourced parts’ and many car makers are still undecided as to how the tariff cost additions will be passed on. A Bentley spokesperson said the company had ‘no plans to pause imports’ to the carmaker’s largest market, but that it was ‘still undecided’ as to whether to absorb the 25 per cent tariff itself or pass this on to customers through the cost of the car. While Morgan’s sports car sales are small fry compared to others on this list, the US is still one of its biggest export markets. The British firm said it wasn’t planning on pausing shipments, but that it had a ‘number of cars on the water already that will land and be subject to the tariffs’. A spokesperson added that it was talking to its dealers and customers about ‘sharing the tariffs’ but that the Morgan Motor Company (MMC) was ‘taking the burden’. ‘For customers going forwards, we have changed margin structures and price of options to help mitigate the full tariff cost, sharing it between MMC, dealers and some burden to the customer.’ they added. Hyundai’s president and CEO Jose Munoz (above) last week said at the Seoul Mobility Show that the company had ‘no plans to raise prices in the United States’ and that its car prices would ‘always remain competitive’. The UK government has also in response to Trump’s tariffs. Fines for non-compliant vehicles have been reduced, while full hybrid vehicles, including the UK-built Toyota Corolla, can now be sold in the period between 2030 and 2035. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: ‘Global trade is being transformed so we must go further and faster in reshaping our economy and our country through our Plan for Change. ‘This will help ensure home-grown firms can export British cars built by British workers around the world and the industry can look forward with confidence, as well as back with pride.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer.

81,Yasa opens £12m super factory in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/yasa-factory/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-13,Car Magazine UK,"Yasa is quickly becoming one of the most and now it’s set to expand. Today, the company opened its new upgraded facility in Yarnton, near Oxford. Costing £12million, the new facility is the first of its kind in the UK and solidifies Yasa’s position as the ‘Cosworth’ of high performance e-motors. ‘With a multi-million-pound investment into our Yarnton facility, we have transformed our manufacturing capability and significantly accelerated our production capacity,’ said Tim Woolmer, Yasa’s CTO and founder. ‘This latest initiative will enable us to apply our technology with even greater accuracy, pace and scale.’ ‘Combined with YASA’s position as part of the Mercedes-Benz Group, the factory transformation consolidates YASA’s role as a global leader in developing high-performance, high-efficiency axial-flux e-motors.’ Measuring a huge 60,000ft², the new facility packs in cutting-edge e-motors technology from CNC coil winding, assembly and impregnation processes to improved rotor balancing accuracy and new high-capacity ovens. It’s the first time that Yasa has had all these processes under one roof, and should greatly improve efficiency as a result. Put it altogether and YASA is forecasting a scale of over 25,000 units per year. That sounds like a lot, but it’s completely necessary when you look at the British brand’s current client list: Ferrari and Lamborghini are two of the brand’s clients, with the latter using Yasa tech in its Temerrario supercar. ‘This vastly improved facility is another important step in YASA’s ongoing strategy to further expand its product and customer portfolio. The new super factory delivers increased flexibility, efficiency, and quality, positioning the company for diverse business opportunities,’ said Joerg Miska, Yasa’s CEO. Thanks to their ultra-compact design and exceptional torque and power, YASA motors are perfectly suited for high-performance hybrid vehicles and other fully electric applications across complementary sectors.’ For more on the Lamborghini Temerario powertrain, read why its engineers traded a V10 for a V8 hybrid, Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

82,The electric Kia PV5 you can push your wheelchair into,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/electric-pv5-wheelchair-accessible-van/,Tom Webster,2025-05-13,Car Magazine UK,"The passenger version of the is set to come as a wheelchair accessible vehicle, which will let you wheel straight onboard via the side door. The will come with a 300kg-rated ramp and a bespoke belt-fastening system to keep wheelchair users safely secured on the move. It has been shown off for the first time at the Financial Times’ Future of the Car Summit and has been done so in collaboration with Motability, meaning it will be available on the UK’s disability car access scheme. You might think that there are plenty of wheelchair accessible vehicles available, with plenty of the van-based cars from the likes of VW and Ford all up to the task. However, the crucial difference with the PV5 is that the work is all done in house by Kia, whereas most of the time the vehicles are sent off to a different company to be converted. What this means is that all the work is done by the same people that build the rest of the vehicle, so it should be that bit more seamless. It also allowed Kia to factor in elements from the start that a third-party company can’t. This includes a third-row tip-up seat that allows people to assist wheelchair users from the side, and that side-entry approach – lots of WAVs make you wheel in from the back, which can mean finding a way to get off a curb if you are parked at the side of the road, and means you run the risk of someone parking too close to the back of the van. Kia is also promising that the PV5 WAV will be able to use its open software platform to integrate necessary applications if needs be. The other bonus of it being made at the plant is that it makes for a slightly more ecological and potentially economical approach as it cuts out a stage of the process. The PV5 is a purely electric vehicle, which means the WAV version is going to be a bit of a rarity in its class, for now at least. Most of the alternatives are based on older diesel models, so Kia is looking to the future. There are two options of battery in the PV5 passenger, with the 51.5kWh standard range promising up to 179 miles and the 71.2kWh long range 249 miles. There might be a slight tweak to this if the mechanical changes have an impact on weight, but only fractionally. What we don’t have yet is confirmed pricing for the PV5 WAV. It is based on the seven-seat passenger version, and we don’t even know quite what that will work out at yet. The entry-level five-seat model starts at £32,995, though. Motability has confirmed that it will offer the PV5 WAV, though, which means it will be available to those who are eligible for the scheme. It shouldn’t be too long until you can order one – Kia started taking pre-orders for the passenger model on 1 May 2025 and is promising deliveries before the end of the year. Given that Kia has shown the WAV fairly soon after the passenger models, expect it to follow not too far behind.

83,Plug off - Fiat's electric 500 gets an engine after all,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/fiat/500-hybrid/,CJ Hubbard,2025-05-13,Car Magazine UK,"The first pre-production examples of the new Fiat 500 Hybrid have left the assembly line at the Mirafiori factory in Italy, and these are the first official images of the new, more affordable version of this iconic city car. Proof of ‘the brand’s social relevance and its strong connection to Italy and its people’ according to Fiat, it also marks another interesting bump in the road towards full electrification. For the new 500 Hybrid is an ICE conversion of a car that was only ever intended to be an EV. And when it was launched, the was one of the you could buy. But as countries throughout Europe began dropping EV incentives, it quickly became clear to Fiat that the electric 500 was too expensive for many of its customers, and the firm has been forced to re-engineer its all-electric halo car with an internal combustion engine. And as it turns out, a close look at the cabin suggests that ‘Hybrid’ label might be over-selling the electrification of this new model as well… Fiat CEO and chief marketing officer, Olivier Francois, confirmed that a ‘hybrid’ version of the Fiat 500 would be back in production before the end of 2025 during the press conference at the launch earlier this year. These new images show that process is on track, with full production start targeted for November. When Fiat found itself with little choice but to remove the from sale in 2024 – it was first introduced in 2007, and it had become out of step with the very – it hadn’t anticipated ever needing another petrol model to replace it. However, as with many other car manufacturers, Fiat has discovered that not all of its customers are ready for an EV. Some of this is lifestyle and infrastructure related – Italy is particularly behind the curve when it comes to supporting fully electric vehicles – but much of it is down to cost. As Francois explained to us in a round table interview, the 500 Electric is just too expensive for many existing 500 customers to seriously consider. The new 500 Hybrid will be offered at a more affordable price. As has been widely reported, Fiat has been forced to cut back on 500 Electric production – galling for a car built at the firm’s famous Mirafiori factory in its home city of Turin – and in December 2024 it was halted completed, only restarting in January 2025. Francois says that this is almost entirely a pricing issue related to most European governments ending the EV incentives and grants that were commonplace until a couple of years ago. The cancelation of the EV subsidies in Germany at the end of 2023 had a particularly big impact on the 500 Electric’s customer base, with sales drying up practically overnight. Until this point, the car had been considered ‘a huge success’ inside Fiat, with ‘incredible’ market share when EV sales were booming. Fiat is clearly proud of the fundamental design and the quality of the car, and Francois stated ‘it will be a very bright day for us’ when the 500 Hybrid model based on the same underpinnings is introduced. According to the latest official information, Mirafiori has the capacity to produce over 100,000 Fiat 500 Hybrids every year. ‘With the 500 Hybrid,’ says Francois, ‘we are strengthening production at Mirafiori to ensure the plant’s productivity and meet the demand. Our roots are in Italy and it’s no coincidence that the two most iconic FIAT are made here: the Panda in Pomigliano and the 500 in Mirafiori.’ Some of us had initially been expecting it to use same trick 1.2-litre as the that will also be going into cheaper versions of the Grande Panda. However, these official images have thrown a rod in that thinking because you can quite clearly see there’s a manual gearbox thanks to the shift-patterned knob sticking out of the centre console. The 1.2-litre system is exclusively offered with a six-speed dual-clutch that’s operated by buttons and paddles. The appearance of an actual gearlever strongly suggests Fiat has resurrected the 1.0-litre mild hybrid from the old model. It’s even the exact same knob if appearances aren’t deceiving. If this is the case, it really is the mildest of mild-hybrid setups that’s better described as a fancy stop-start system than a really impressive eco-measure. On the plus side, the use of this older tech should help hammer down the price. At this stage Fiat isn’t confirming anything. But a contact has suggested that one of the options could come from the current Pandino – Italy’s pet name for the regular Fiat Panda, which is still sold in Europe – and this does indeed use the 1.0-litre mild hybrid that was also deployed in the previous 500. Options, on the other hand, suggests there may be more than one petrol powertrain on the way for the new 500. So we might still see the 1.2-litre auto as well, after all. The new car won’t go on sale until the end of 2025, so no-one’s putting an official figure on anything just yet. But Fiat has been extremely bullish about competitive pricing in recent months, with the and still delivering a very appealing product. As such, we’ve been told to expect the new 500 Hybrid to be priced as close to the cost of the old one as possible, which started at under £17,000 when it was still available in 2024. However, Francois warned us March it will be ‘slightly more expensive’ due to the additional cost of the necessary safety equipment. And, very frankly, because it is being built in Italy, rather than Poland (where the old Fiat 500 hybrid was assembled). The Fiat 500e is currently priced from £25,035. If the new 500 Hybrid using the old 1.0-litre engine then we strongly believe Fiat will be aiming to bring it in at under £20k.

The company announced a net loss of £3.4bn over the course of 2024 and says 2025 isn’t looking any rosier. To combat the plunging losses, new CEO Ivan Espinosa – who took over from Makoto Uchida – has initiated the Re:Nissan plan. The aim is for the company to become profitable again after the 2026 financial year. ‘As new management, we are taking a prudent approach to reassess our targets and actively seek every possible opportunity to implement and ensure a robust recovery,’ says Espinosa. ‘Re:Nissan is an action-based recovery plan clearly outlines what we need to do now. All employees are committed to working together as a team to implement this plan, with the goal of returning to profitability by fiscal year 2026.’ However, to do that, Nissan is undergoing a transition perhaps never seen by the company before, including sweeping job losses and facility closures. Nissan says it has introduced an ‘aggressive cost reduction’ target of £1.2bn by FY2026. The biggest news is the loss of a total of 20,000 jobs worldwide – 11,000 more than initially announced – including in areas like manufacturing, administrative and R&D. The brand has also confirmed it will ‘consolidate its vehicle production’ by closing seven manufacturing plants (down to 10) by 2027. Given the investments and new models (like the and ) being manufactured at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland in the UK, this will not be included in the closures. Other areas of savings include reducing parts complexity and the amount of car platforms the brand uses, reducing the range from 13 down to seven. It also aims to shorten development time to get new models to market faster, including the next-generation Skyline. For Europe, Nissan will lean even more on its Renault partner to help develop and engineer new models – as well as focus on building more B and C-segment SUVs. That said, the brand has also confirmed it ‘will temporarily pause advanced and post-FY26 product activities to mobilise 3,000 people to focus on cost reduction initiatives,’ meaning all future car projects that aren’t in the pre-production stage have been frozen. With these drastic plans in place, Espinosa and the brand’s accountants hope to save around £2.5bn in total. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

85,Alfa Romeo: 'reachable’ sports cars will return once we’ve ‘delivered results’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/upcoming-sports-cars/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-13,Car Magazine UK,"Profitability. That six-syllable word can strike down any Alfa Romeo accountant. Or at least it could before Jean-Phillipe Imparato arrived in 2021 to steady the ship. By the time he , Alfa Romeo was one of the fastest growing premium brands in the world, enjoying a massive 30% increase in sales in 2023 alone. He also implemented a bold new product plan that’ll see Alfa launch replacements for the and by the end of 2026, followed by a new, . It certainly seems like Alfa is functioning well, but there’s one thing in the company’s plan that’s conspicuous by its absence. A sports car. And before you all write in to complain, for the purposes of this report, I’m ignoring the . It’s a great pin-up for Alfa Romeo, but it doesn’t really respect the heritage of cars like the GTV, the Spider or even the 4C, as it’s a ludicrously expensive handbuilt supercar for a ruthlessly selective customer base. It isn’t a performance car anyone can buy. But that could soon change. At the launch of the Junior Ibrida, I quizzed Cristiano Fiorio, head of Alfa Romeo’s marketing department, about whether the 33 Stradale will form the template for all Alfa’s future sports cars – and he told me it won’t. ‘Any person working at Alfa Romeo will tell you that we would like to have another performance sort of reachable car,’ he said. ‘But I always believe that, before going into dreams, we have to deliver. ‘Alfa Romeo doesn’t have the means of Audi or Mercedes or Porsche because of volumes that we generate – and we have to do things step by step. So, we have been, in the last three/four years, being very diligent in putting in order again the accountability of the brand in terms of delivering results. ‘We have to start from the credibility. Doing one model every year, proving that we are able to execute, to make it profitable, to make numbers which are acceptable for the investment we have done. Once we have done a track record on that, then we can dream.’ From what I gather, that project was off the books. It was developed in a similar fashion to the Lamborghini Miura, in the sense it was pieced together after hours by a team of devoted enthusiasts who were under strict instructions to not let it bankrupt the company. Fiorio explained: ‘The 33 Stradale was done by a crazy bunch of people that said “okay, let’s go against the odds.” It was a project that was managed outside the normal business day-to-day of the company. The agreement was the day-to-day activities. ‘Because if you impact that and if you start saying, “oh, but yeah, I was working on the 33 Stradale. That is why I didn’t sell one more Junior, one more Tonale, one more Giulia.” Then, . You are not going to do that.’ Fiorio further justified the 33 Stradale’s existence with an anecdote about how much the car has improved Alfa’s image. ‘You can argue that it’s for 33 people,’ he said, ‘but the extension of 33 Stradale is huge. The number of video games, scale models, accessories that we have been working on doing with 33 Stradale is immense.’ That’s what worries me. Over the next five years, Alfa Romeo will be steadily swept under the shade of the Stellantis technical umbrella, which has the potential to choke the life out of its cars. My lasting impression of the – the first Alfa born from this new world order – is that it drives like a slightly stiffer Peugeot. It’s hardly the last word in dynamism simply because its STLA Medium platform doesn’t lend itself well to sporty cars. Alfa also won’t use the Giorgio platform that underpins the current Giulia as it’s now handed development of that chassis over to Maserati. So, STLA Large will likely become the saving grace of Alfa’s sports car. Mercifully, Fiorio hinted in the same interview the platform can accept a petrol engine – and that Alfa Romeo is considering using the architecture to by augmenting it with hybrid technology. However, the architecture is designed to underpin cars measuring between 4764mm and 5126mm long, which is outside the realm of your average two-seat sports car. To put those dimensions into perspective, the measures 4542mm long, while the is just 3915mm. For that reason, I expect Alfa’s new sports car will evolve into a rival for the and . To Fiorio’s credit, it’ll be a lot more ‘reachable’ than the 33 Stradale – but it probably won’t be anything close to what your average driver would call ‘affordable.’ Alfa’s got a profit margin to protect, after all.

86,Boring business + exciting products = profitable Aston Martin,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/aston-martin/profitable-aston-martin/,Colin Overland,2025-05-14,Car Magazine UK,"Now some months into his new job, Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark has the confident air of a man who’s certain his plan is going to work. ‘How do you make a company successful? You’ve got to have a plan. That plan has got to be brawny and stable. You create excitement around it, but you don’t create excitement by ripping it up every five minutes,’ he says in a meeting room at Aston’s Gaydon HQ. ‘There’s enough excitement to the products and the design, the way we activate them in the marketplace. But in here, I want it to be quiet, calm, boring and successful. That’s the mission.’ Financial results and sales figures for 2024 are not yet available as we speak, but the former Bentley boss is bullish: ‘It’s an opportunity to make it, for the first time in 112 years, sustainably profitable. ‘The market has totally changed, as have the prospects for luxury car brands. In our price bracket, there are around four times more people, each with around four times more wealth, than there were 20 years ago.’ So how will Aston grab a bigger share of that lucrative market? ‘In the last four years we’ve gone through this almost frenzy of product development. Four cars launched in 18 months – I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s almost worked. Any difficulties we’ve had, it’s not been because of lack of money. We’re spending at a rate we’ve never done before. It’s similar to Bentley five years ago – for a company that’s less than half the size. ‘Every year there’s been something that’s just knocked us off achieveing the breakthrough. I’m not saying this year is going to be the [turning point]. We reset the business last year, and we’ve reset expectations for the next five years, and we’ve reset the sense of how we’re going to get there [profitability]. Volume is less of an interesting topic for us than value creation.’ The trick now is to slow down the rate of new-car launches and instead emulate rivals such as Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari and even Rolls-Royce, by offering customers a huge range of options and by frequently adding new variants of those cars. Hallmark notes that the Porsche 911 will be offered in around 15 flavours in a five-year period, whereas the habit at Aston has been to launch a coupe, follow it with a convertible, and then… nothing. ‘There’s got to be a reason to buy another, better Vantage, and two years after that, another, better Vantage. We’ve never had that intensity of lifecycle innovation. The competition are doing it and we’re not. We’ve never been as successful as we could be. We’ve put a lot of effort in the last few months into analysing ourselves and our competition, and developing a plan for each name plate.’ The profit to be had from options – different exhausts, audio upgrades, cosmetic changes – is ‘phenomenal’. And doing a variant of an existing model is relatively straightforward. Hallmark’s fag-packet workings show that if an all-new car has 5000 component, 4900 of them will be new. With a derivative, only about 100 parts are new. ‘The level of complexity to have a sportier version with a bit more power, or a more luxurious version with a bit more glamour, is marginal.’ There’s also hay to be made from limited-edition cars with prices in seven figures, so long as it doesn’t distract from the core models. ‘Valiant was less than a year from concept to delivery. We need to slow it down a bit and get boring. We’re going to use Vanquish and Valhalla as the basis to do a couple of specials – not just a different roof but a completely different concept, using the core technology from those two cars.’ At the other extreme of the line-up, he acknowledges that the DBX hasn’t really achieved lift-off. Successful SUVs from Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce have transformed those companies’ business models. But his experience at Bentley, which now does very well with the Bentayga, gives him hope. ‘DBX has been in the market three and a half years, versus Bentayga nine years. In 2018 Bentayga was doing 3500-4000 a year, instead of nearly 8000 in 2023. What happened there was a facelift and a bit of commucation. DBX I still fundamentally believe in.’ And what about the territory beyond Valhalla? Will there be a successor to the extreme Valkyrie? Especially now that Adrian Newey, that car’s chief architect, is now working for Aston’s F1 team, it doesn’t seem too wild a leap. Hallmark urges caution. ‘Not many car companies can afford, financially or emotionally, to do a car that’s so far ahead of themselves and everybody else every year. It would kill you. For Ferrari, even Porsche, it’s seven to 10 years between that kind of car. ‘Valhalla is somewhere between a regular supercar and a hypercar. We wouldn’t want to do a new one of those every year either. But Valkyrie is incredible. Everything on that car is absolutely unique, never done before. ‘Megacars – once a decade. Supercars – watch this space.’ The transition to electric has seemed to go on and off Aston’s priority list over the years. Hallmark is clear: ‘The general direction is still towards electrification. To get to net zero, we will add products in the hybrid space before we get to full electric. We will have our first electric car in this decade, but we will add hybrid derivatives as well through to 2035. We’re fully committed to BEV, but there’s no way we can go all-BEV overnight and sustain the company. ‘We’re not resisting. We’re trying to manage through a period of high risk. We can’t afford to do engines, hybrids and electric cars and just see which one’s working – every one’s got to be a winner.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
87,Trump's EPA chief wants stop/start systems banned,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/stop-start/,Graham King,2025-05-14,Car Magazine UK,"The head of the USA’s Environmental Protection Agency has said that the stop/start technology fitted to the vast majority of cars sold in America should be banned. This past Monday, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin posted on X: ‘Stop/start technology: where your car dies at every red light so companies get a climate participation trophy. EPA approved it, and everyone hates it, so we’re fixing it.’ Stop/start systems turn a car’s engine off when it’s stationary, then start it again just before you set off – as it says on the tin. In a manual, the engine usually turns off when you shift into neutral and fires up when you press the clutch back down. In an automatic, selecting park usually does the trick, and the engine restarts when you press the throttle. The point of the endeavour is partly to save fuel that would otherwise be wasted with the engine idling. But the key reasoning is to reduce emissions. Engines run very inefficiently at idle and chuck out a lot of nasty emissions, particularly nitrogen dioxide. That’s shown in many air quality surveys showing very high levels of pollution localised around areas that are prone to heavy, mostly idling traffic. Take the idling engines away and air quality soon improves significantly. It’s fair to say that plenty of drivers think stop/start systems are rather irksome. They can seemingly activate at random, and they undoubtedly do at inconvenient moments; older diesels tend to shudder back to life, too.  But does everyone hate it, as administrator Zeldin claims? No. I don’t. And if you do, you can always turn it off. A few things to note about Lee Zeldin. He’s a former attorney and politician who was a Trump ally during his first term as US President. He has absolutely no background in environmental law, science or policy as every other EPA head has had. He’s a prominent climate change sceptic. His sole qualification for one of the biggest jobs in US government – running a department created by Republican darling Richard Nixon – is his loyalty to Trump and his commitment to an agenda of deregulation. That’s right, the purpose of the EPA has been flipped. It’s no longer there to protect the environment and public health through regulation. It’s there to remove those same regulations. Why? Because it costs a lot of money for the heavily polluting companies subject to those regulations to meet them; those same companies donate a lot of money to Trump and the Republican party and expect a return on that investment. We’re not getting political here, by the way, just stating the facts of the matter. It’s clear that Zeldin and his backers don’t like stop/start systems. After all, they save fuel, which cuts into oil company profits, and we can’t have that, can we? But here’s the crucial thing about his proclamation. As in the UK, while stop/start systems are necessary for cars sold in the US to meet emissions standards, they’re not actually legally required as Zeldin implies. So, there are two ways you could potentially get rid of them. 1) Massively lower emissions standards such that stop/start is no longer necessary. Trump may well try to make that happen by executive order. Not that one could be implemented anyway, because only Congress has the power to enact such a change by passing new laws. 2) Legislate to specifically ban stop/start systems. In both cases, in order to get rid of stop/start, this EPA head who sees his mission as being to get rid of regulations would have to… create new regulations. Which would almost certainly be challenged in court. And ignored by an industry that wouldn’t want the hassle and expense of removing stop/start from their cars. We could continue elaborating on how ill-conceived Zeldin’s notion is but, in sum, it’s highly unlikely to come within a giant, yawning chasm of being implemented.

88,"Confirmed: Renault's new, cutesy Twingo will come to the UK",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/twingo/,Tim Pollard,2025-05-14,Car Magazine UK,"It’s official, Renault will bring the new Twingo E-Tech to the UK. The super cute, retro-tastic supermini that is nearing production will take on cars like the Hyundai Inster and BYD Dolphin Surf when it launches from 2026 onwards. If you’re sat there thinking ‘well, …’ then we have news for you: that wasn’t a given. To keep costs down, it was considered that Renault would only develop left-hand drive models. However, brand boss Fabrice Cambolive has confirmed that it will arrive on our shores. ‘I’m pleased to confirm Renault Twingo will launch in the UK. I put all my attention on the challenge to launch Twingo in right-hand drive, because I believe a car under 20,000 euro equivalent has huge potential in the UK as well as Europe,’ says Cambolive. ‘Accessibility to EVs is critical for the future, and Twingo offers something new for Renault.’ However, while the Twingo is confirmed for launch in 2026, it’s not a given that right-hand drive models will arrive at the same time. We may have to wait a little longer for it to hit the UK. The news comes after Renault CEO Luca de Meo has reiterated the company’s ambitions for and innovative approach to the new Twingo . Speaking at the , he said Renault had ‘partnered with the best’ and claimed setting up the Shanghai Ampere China development centre ‘put Renault directly into the most vibrant development eco-system globally.’ Ampere is Renault’s specialist EV division. Referring again to the promised 10kW per 100km efficiency figure – that’s equivalent to 6 miles per kW – which would be ‘best in class’, de Meo said Renault had ‘set the conditions to make a small EV in Europe in a very, very competitive way.’ As part of this, he underlined the new Twingo’s ‘dramatically reduced complexity.’ According to de Meo: ‘In 2019 our cars had between 2200 and 2600 parts on average. The new Twingo will have around 750. That’s a reduction of 30 per cent compared to the Renault 5.’ How has this been made possible? ‘It’s actually a completely different way of designing the cars. We pushed for the systematic reuse of on the shelf parts. So before the our carry-over never exceeded 50 per cent. Now we achieve up to 80 per cent. And the bottom line is a price that will be below €20,000 without subsidies. That’s less than €100 per month for our clients.’ That’s the equivalent of around £16,500, and will make the Twingo one of the on sale. With a footprint 20 per cent smaller than the average European car it’s also like to be one of the as well. ‘In my opinion,’ said de Meo, ‘the car is going to be a gamechanger – like Twingo was 30 years ago… A strong, clever, inclusive counterproposal of the European industry to the challenges of sustainable mobility.’ The speed of the Twingo’s development is set to entirely shake-up existing practices at Renault, resulting in a new standard that’s been labelled Renault Leap 100, as de Meo explains. ‘From now on that means that we will target to make all our cars in 100 weeks. That’s less than two years. Actually, the Twingo will be done in 21 months. I think we’ve just moved to Chinese speed, thanks especially to the people of Ampere.’ During the same conference, de Mao also announced there would be a new , which is highly likely to share plenty with the new Twingo. This is targeting a list price of under $18,000, equivalent to less than £14,900. Hopefully the result will still be a dramatic improvement over the , the firm’s current £15k electric car. The new Renault Twingo interior was revealed for the first time at the 2025 Brussels motor show. There’s a flavour of the original Twingo’s cabin with clever storage and a host of cool detailing. It’s a stripped-back, minimalist cockpit that looks remarkably production-ready; you can see the relationship with the and , with whom it shares its EV hardware – the gearlever, stalks, switchgear and 10.1-inch touchscreen tech are familiar, but the door handles echo the Mk1 Twingo’s and there are pleasingly physical dials and buttons for frequently used controls such as heating and ventilation. The Twingo Mk4 made its public debut at the 2024 , with an earlier sighting at the Renault 4 previews. It’s being developed on a new fast-track process in conjunction with a Chinese partner – meaning it’s taking just two years from design to production. Crucially, some details are now evolving, as the Twingo 4 nears production: there’s a new showroom-spec air intake up front, the rear wheelarches are a tad smaller and the bumper detailing is fresh at both ends. Note, too, how the door handles are no longer illuminated, there’s a front quarterlight near the door mirrors and the rear lamp graphic is fresh. The new Renault Twingo is a fully electric city car that returns to the monobox roots of the 1992 original, rebooted for the electric age. CAR has been given early access to the sub-€20,000 (£17k) EV and has met its designers to get the full lowdown. This is a compact five-door city car stretching to just 3.75m long and 1.75m wide, making it perfect to dash around London or Paris. Yet clever packaging with a wheel-in-each-corner stance and 2.5m wheelbase promises space for five. ‘We really tried to recreate the monobox shape of the first-generation Renault Twingo,’ Sandeep Bhambra, Renault’s chief designer in the advanced design department, told CAR magazine. ‘It simply wasn’t possible with the combustion engine models with pedestrian safety and suchlike – they always ended up being a two-box shape. We’re taking Twingo back to its roots!’ Not so fast… Turns out the new Twingo has not yet been approved for right-hand drive production – meaning that Brits are at risk of not being able to buy the cheeky Mk4 you see in these newly released photos. That’s tantalising, because now that we have seen it in the metal we have to say it looks sensational. Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo had already confirmed the return of the Twingo at the first Ampere Capital Markets Day in winter 2023. The new small electric city car is destined to become the third icon to be electrified by the group, slotting beneath the 2025 European Car of the Year-winning Renault 5 and upcoming Renault 4. The new European-built Twingo, according to de Meo, is ‘a fit-for-purpose urban vehicle with no compromise,’ promising efficiency figures of around 10kWh/100km [6 miles per kWh] with CO2 emissions around 75% lower ‘than the average European ICE car sold in 2023 over its lifecycle.’ ‘We’ve done it with the Dacia Spring, now it’s time for Renault,’ added de Meo (below) during the press conference. What you see here are various iterations of the concept car, but de Meo pledged a record-breaking development time by partnering with a Chinese component supplier: ‘We will develop the Twingo in the record time of two years from concept to start of production – matching the speed of the Chinese OEMs [manufacturers],’ he told investors back in 2023. The production version of the new Twingo is due in 2026, although Brits may yet be denied the chance to buy one. The cost of engineering it to right-hand drive is put at around £1 million and the slender margins of city cars means the business case is not yet decided. Renault has form for blocking RHD exports of cars that do not warrant conversion, remember. Today it sells 17 different model ranges in France, compared to the 11 listed on the UK website. Sentimentality counts for nought in business… Renault’s Ampere sub-division is developing the group’s electrification and technology strategy, including the iconic nameplates being spun off including the Renault Twingo, 4 and 5 – cars designed to appeal to EV sceptics, according to design chief Gilles Vidal. ‘They resonate with buyers who remember the old cars, yet they are indisputably fresh and modern.’ Ampere is also taking the lead on producing the new (which is heavily based off the 5 EV) and producing another car for Mitsubishi. To do that, Renault’s CMF-BEV and CMF-EV platforms are being renamed to AMP-R Small and AMP-R Medium in order to compete more directly with Stellantis and VW Group electric cars. There is also more of a focus on software than ever before, with Renault Group developing its own software architecture using Google and Qualcomm technologies. The brand is introducing an AI-augmented assistant called Reno, harnessing the power of digital partners and machine learning to give occupants a personal assistant on board. Bhambra, whose design sketch was picked for the final concept car, told CAR the Twingo show car you see here is ‘90% the finished product.’ ‘The proportions and design language are totally inspired by the original,’ he said. ‘We used to call the Mk1 the – meaning “a living space” – and we’ve used the same philosophy here. ‘We’ve pared everything back: it’s a very minimalist designs, with just a few strong graphics, like the door handles, the simple lights and the air scoops on the bonnet – which are functional, by the way; they feed the air-con and cabin air.’ Even the Twingo script on the boot is a neat detail. One of Bhambra’s team designed an entire Twingo typeface, with each letter taking on a character: the T is a positive symbol reflecting the battery at its heart, the N is a bridge and the G becomes a Google geolocator on the nav. A neat touch. The concept car runs on 18-inch alloy wheels and has a digital badge, which cycles through animated versions of the Renault logo. Forget that for production, but the glass roof will survive, bathing the cabin in cool daylight. The interior is awash with smart detailing: cork flooring is designed to be sustainable, muck-resistant and durable, while the rear seat slides and folds just like the original’s – so owners can juggle space for limbs and luggage. The Mk1 Twingo was amazingly practical in its day and Renault wants to keep that modularity intact for the 2026 Mk4 newcomer. In a clever twist, the front headrests are magnetic, so rear-seat passengers can attach their phones or tablets, while an elastic strap can hold maps (remember them?) or water bottles. Meanwhile, the designers say the backrest adjusters are inspired by skateboard wheels – one of numerous ‘Easter eggs’ dotted around the cabin. Are you waiting for a chic small electric car like this?

89,Why Lotus is returning to engines,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lotus/returning-to-engines/,Nick Gibbs,2025-05-15,Car Magazine UK,"In the risks section of the Lotus share prospectus published October 2023 lurks this prescient warning to potential investors: ‘If the market for luxury electric vehicles does not develop as we expect… our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results will be affected.’ A little more than a year later, the risk has materialised alarmingly quickly and the luxury EV business is on its knees. Even in Lotus’s new home of China – cradle of the EV world – sales of high-end electric cars fell 50 per cent in 2024, CEO Feng Qingfeng admitted to investors on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. That has whacked Lotus right in its growth trajectory. The and then the were supposed to be catnip to a luxury-loving populace more focused on coping with traffic jams than maximising corner g’s, but Lotus sales actually dropped six per cent in China in the first nine months of the year, shrinking below European sales figures. Lotus’s reaction to discovering luxury customers are now declaring themselves too posh to plug is to say well, fine, we are not too proud to pivot. The brand announced in November it would rip up its plan to go all-electric by 2028 and instead would launch ‘Hyper Hybrid’ models from 2026 that add a turbocharged combustion engine as a range extender. ‘If we went with our original plans, it wouldn’t suit every market globally, especially with the tariffs,’ Dan Balmer, the new CEO of Lotus Europe, told CAR. Handily the EU doesn’t include hybrids of any sort in its new China EV tariffs. The new technology can be incorporated into the Electric Premium Architecture underpinning the Eletre and Emeya, giving them a range of almost 700 miles. Meanwhile the Type 134 smaller SUV, a rival for the that had been scheduled for a 2025 reveal, has been put on hold. ‘We’re taking the chance to look at the market again and read the room,’ Balmer said. Lotus will also delay its electric sports car, Type 135, and extend the life of the Emira. Unmoved by the lure of lower running costs or purchase incentives, the rich are currently seeing very little advantages in switching to electric. ‘Luxury car engines are already very powerful, and the driving experience is quite similar, with eight-cylinder and 12-cylinder engines performing well,’ Feng admitted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal at the Guangzhou auto show in November. The Hyper Hybrid is the answer, Lotus hopes. EREVs, or extended-range electric vehicles, have become big business at the premium end of the market in China. Li Auto’s blandly attractive SUVs with their big batteries mated to a back-up 1.5-litre engine have eaten into the market share of BMW, Mercedes and JLR. The problem for a luxury manufacturer is that once the battery is depleted the four-cylinder engine is sweating hard to power a generator to keep the electric motor fed. Lotus’s solution is the Dual Hyper Charging technology. Once the battery runs low mid-journey, the company’s ‘ultra-fast’ On-The-Drive Charging technology will provide a rapid top-up, theoretically retaining the same smooth, powerful electric experience for longer. ‘It will satisfy Lotus users’ pursuit of driving joy,’ Feng told analysts. When the car is stopped, ‘flash-charging’ (by which Lotus simply means a quick visit to a plug-in charger) tops the battery up from 10 per cent to 80 per cent full in 10 minutes, according to the company. This is ‘similar to a battery swap’, Lotus says in reference to technology employed by Nio, another premium EV company fiercely competing for share among the plug-shy rich. All this is enabled by a 900-volt electric architecture, upgraded from the 800-volt system in the electric-only Eletre and Emeya, two cars that already charge as fast as anything on the market at speeds of up to 340kW. The Hyper Hybrid won’t use the AMG four-cylinder unit currently available in the Emira, Balmer said, without saying what it will employ. It’s likely the engine will come from Horse, the Geely parent company’s new hybrid-focused engine business formed with Renault. Lotus also wants to sell the tech to outside car makers, once it has given itself a head-start, Feng said. Lotus’s precision U-turn is arguably only possible due to its relationship to Geely. The Chinese behemoth is busy recalibrating other formerly electric-only brands to react to its country’s new embrace of the plug-in hybrid in its various forms, including its Audi rival Zeekr and Smart, a 50/50 joint venture with Mercedes. Despite falling short of its self-imposed targets, Lotus is in fact growing: 7617 sales in the first nine months of 2024, up 136 per cent from same period in the year before. For a company that has traditionally regarded anything over 2500 sales in a year as cause for celebration, these are clearly very different times, albeit unprofitable. The share prospectus spoke of 47,000 sales in 2024 on the way to 150,000 by 2028. Even the heavily revised figure of 12,000 for 2024 was ‘definitely challenging’, Feng admitted. The bullish initial figures were ‘predicated off near-linear adoption in all markets’, Balmer said. ‘We’ve now recognised that it’s more of a market-share objective.’ Lotus, like many other car companies, is having to throttle back production, both in its Wuhan, China facility and Hethel, as it works through unsold inventory. The company even had to let 200 staff go at its Norfolk sports car facility due to weakened demand for the combustion-engined Emira, which accounted for just under half of sales in the first nine months of 2024. Balmer blamed weakened Emira demand on the ‘normal lifecycle’ of a three-year-old car. Meanwhile the first £2m Evija electric hypercars will be delivered in the second quarter of 2025, six years after the car’s unveiling. The world has changed immeasurably since Geely bought 51 per cent of Lotus from Malaysia’s Proton in 2017. Most of the production promises Geely has made for Lotus it has largely delivered, including the new factory in Wuhan for the ‘lifestyle’ vehicles. The cars too have largely lived up to their promise amid what’s arguably been an even more challenging brand renewal than Jaguar’s. As late as 2022 the company was still lauding its ‘sensible decision’ to swing for all-EV by 2028. But a combination of government-level anti-China sentiment and a huge swing away from EVs among the super rich after initially embracing them has left Lotus with little choice but to activate Reinvention 2.0 and welcome back the combustion engine.

91,"Dacia is ‘not chasing EuroNCAP stars,’ says boss – but won’t ‘take bets’ on passive safety",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/dacia/crash-safety/,Jake Groves,2025-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"Dacia CEO Denis Le Vot has told CAR that the brand ‘is not chasing EuroNCAP stars,’ when questioned about the brand’s crash safety ratings. The value car brand that’s part of the wider Renault Group has scored mixed results in EuroNCAP crash safety tests over the years, with even its most recent models like only clocking in a middling three-star rating. The , in pre-facelift form, fared even worse – collecting a one-star rating, with the new one not set to be re-tested until 2027. Le Vot says that the EuroNCAP stars are ‘the way [of measuring safety] that everyone is using’ when it comes to passive (i.e.: structural and physical crash mitigation) safety. ‘And, if you are a client, you can refer to that as a way to compare the car to others. This is something I respect.’ ‘Now though, the weight of the active safety [i.e. the use of technology to help mitigate crashes] that has been gained is complicated to handle,’ says Le Vot. ‘That’s why we have made a choice; we don’t like to take bets on the passive safety, but we make choices on active safety.’ The Spring is the outlier to that point, however, having scored a significantly lower adult and passenger occupant score than every other Dacia tested. ‘We are sorry to see that we got one star on the Jogger, mainly because we did not include a seatbelt reminder on the third row. We can discuss this forever, but it is a choice that we made,’ adds Le Vot. ‘But parents, when they put their child in the third row, would always take care to make sure their seatbelts are on anyway. Adding that feature adds more cost to the car, and more manipulation needed for the seats in the third row. Everything for us comes back to what is essential, and what is not.’ That said, some car buyers are hugely attracted to cars with four and five-star crash ratings and are actively put off by cars that don’t have a high safety rating. ‘There are people who would buy cars because they have five stars, and will spend any amount of money to get that to feel secure. I totally respect that,’ responds Le Vot. ‘But there are so many people who simply cannot afford to buy a new car like that, and would then go and look at a second hand one which these days would be a zero or even a negative-star car,’ he adds. ‘Even if you take a car that is only five years old, it would be a zero-star car now. ‘So, when we put out cars that have three stars now, they still have a very high level of passive safety and it would be a way safer car than the one it will likely replace anyway.’ Le Vot adds that because Dacia is in the game of ‘affordable mobility,’ the cars the brand makes are designed to replace older cars that are worse in terms of emissions, efficiency and safety. ‘When you’re replacing second-hand cars that are six… seven years old with these new ones, that is a good job for the community.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

92,Meet the new Xpeng P7,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/xpeng/p7/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Xpeng P7, the latest car in the for luxury sector domination. Penned by Rafik Ferrag – the Frenchman responsible for the less remarkable previous-generation car – the new P7 promises to move the game on in terms of style and specs. ‘The original P7 was a milestone for Xpeng and a turning point in China’s EV landscape,’ said Ferrag. ‘With this new generation, we set out to design a pure electric sports sedan that could amaze at every angle.’ The first P7 wasn’t just a car – it became part of my soul,’ added Ferrag. Details are thin on the ground, but we do know the new P7 is a five-seater sports sedan, and one that develops Xpeng’s already neat and well-formed design language. Just look at these pictures compared to the current G6 or previous P7 for example, and you can see the direction the brand is headed. Xpeng is keen to talk about the technical prowess of the P7, but isn’t too keen on giving actual details. To that end, all we know is that CEO He Xiaopeng describes the car as ‘a major upgrade for the brand’s next technological leap: one that blends AI-powered luxury, cutting-edge Xpeng Turing Smart Driving, and an immersive smart cockpit into a sleek and futuristic form.’ Breaking that jargon down suggests a bump to the brand’s AI-based autonomous tech, though much of it isn’t available in the UK. Alongside that, we’re also expecting an improvement to the brand’s smart cockpit tech – something the current-gen already scores well for. It’ll be interesting to see how Xpeng takes the tech up a notch whilst still being relatively accessible. Xpeng hasn’t revealed anything about a release date for the P7 yet, or if it’ll be coming to the UK at all. In a launch event earlier this year, Xpeng execs identified the G6 SUV and X9 luxury MPV as the two cars set to hit British roads. We’ll update this article when we know more.

93,The Toyota bZ4X Touring is its coolest electric car yet,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/bz4x-touring/,Ted Welford,2025-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s electric car line-up has just got a whole lot more desirable with the reveal of the bZ4X Touring, a new that certainly has a Subaru Outback look about it. Based on Toyota’s rather unloved , the Touring brings some big practicality advantages courtesy of being 14cm longer and 2cm taller than the standard car – measuring 4.83m in length and 1.67m in height. The 600-litre boot is also 148 litres larger than the standard bZ4X, and addresses one of its main weaknesses. The new bZ4X Touring is the sibling car to the , recently revealed at the New York Auto Show. While Toyota describes this Touring as an ‘authentic SUV’, there’s no kidding that this looks like a raised estate car, channelling the elongated profile and spaciousness these cars are known for. That’s a very good thing in our eyes. Its roof rails can also carry 70kg, while new interior and exterior colours aim to emphasise its rugged ability. A 1.5-tonne towing capacity is also double that of the standard SUV. The Touring also uses slightly different powertrains to the bZ4X, with front- and four-wheel-drive. Given it uses the firm’s e-TNGA platform, which was developed with Subaru and its , there’s a good chance it will have some proper off-roading pedigree. A dedicated ‘XMode’ with a ‘GripControl’ traction system is also included. The front-wheel-drive model produces 221bhp, while the all-wheel-drive and its second electric motor takes this up to 376bhp, making it the most powerful Toyota EV yet, with 38bhp more than the most powerful bZ4X SUV. All Tourings will use a 74.7kWh net capacity battery, which includes a new water cooling system and enhanced preconditioning for improved efficiency. Toyota claims a range of up to 348 miles, which is slightly down on the SUV. It’s compatible with 150kW DC rapid charging, and up to 22kW AC charging. The new Toyota bZ4X Touring will arrive in the UK in Spring 2026, with prices and specs still to be finalised. It will form part of an onslaught of new Toyota EVs. The Japanese firm might have been (exceptionally) slow in launching electric cars, but following a in summer 2025 will closely follow a new and as more compact electric SUVs. An electric RAV4 is also in the pipeline and expected imminently. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
94,French flair goes off-road with the Renault 4 Savane concept,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/new-node/,Paula Cullington,2025-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has revealed a new take on its retro-futurist – and this time, it’s gone off-road. The new Renault 4 Savane 4×4 Concept is making its global debut at the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament in Paris on the19th of May. Visually, it’s still recognisably the modern Renault 4, but this one’s beefed up with chunkier wheel arches, gloss black bumpers and a raised ride height. A bespoke shade of Jade Green paint sets it apart, while a pixel-style roof fabric nods to both digital design and camping-kit ruggedness. There are new 18-inch Savane wheels shod in Goodyear tyres, and the stance is 15mm taller than the standard electric 4. But this isn’t just a styling exercise. Renault has fitted a second electric motor on the rear axle, giving the Savane permanent all-wheel drive — a sign that the AmpR Small platform (formerly CMF-B EV) can handle more adventurous territory. While Renault hasn’t shared exact power figures, the regular Renault 4 we recently tested is front-wheel drive with either 118bhp or 148bhp. Adding a rear motor could push this 4×4 concept’s combined output close to 300bhp, making it a surprisingly capable little explorer. As well as the Renault 4 Savane 4×4 being on show at Roland-Garros, the brand is also displaying a special edition Renault 5 Roland-Garros – a limited-run hatch priced under £30k – and the wild , a rear-driven EV that looks like a concept car but is fully road-legal, with a price tag of £135,000. There’s no official word yet on whether the 4 Savane 4×4 Concept previews a production model, but it’s clear Renault is testing the waters for a more rugged version of its small EVs – and given the segment’s appetite for soft-road style, don’t be surprised if something similar hits showrooms in the next few years.

95,"Dacia, Renault and Stellantis are here to save the small car",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/renault-stellantis-small-cars/,Jake Groves,2025-05-19,Car Magazine UK,"Lighter. Cheaper. Simpler. More efficient. That’s the kind of cars what Europeans want and need, according to both Group Renault and Stellantis. In case you missed it, the heads of two European car making giants – Luca De Meo and John Elkann – got together at the Financial Times’ Future of the Car summit to launch a continent-sized red flag about the state of the industry. The sitrep isn’t good: cars, regardless of powertrain, have gotten too bloated and heavy – either to meet safety requirements or because of battery-electric architecture packaging constraints. Increasingly punitive tailpipe emissions targets mean small cars have been made extremely difficult to produce and/or unprofitable, pushing car makers to build larger SUVs many consumers don’t actually need. Both De Meo (pictured below) and Elkann have rallied against incoming combustion engine bans, too, and posit the need for a new approach to emissions controls that considers the whole life cycle of the car – not just what comes out the back. Denis Le Vot, head of Dacia, is feeling rather smug then. Given the brand champions such attributes in its cars no matter the size, this new approach is right up his street. ‘This is the moment,’ he smiles when talking to CAR the very evening after the summit was held. ‘Regulations have been pushing us to a point to where affordable mobility doesn’t exist anymore. We are having to press all of the buttons at the same time; ‘I want my CO2 down. I want my security. I want my GSR2. I want my EuroNCAP stars. I want my recyclability.’ Put all these together and it becomes impossible to get this all down to a decent price, particularly for a four-metre-or-less car. I think it’s very fair and intelligent to ask if we went too far.’ Dacia arguably does better than most to reduce costs and keep things essential – one of the brand’s key tenets. Some may disagree with according to Le Vot, but it’s one element of what keeps the brand’s cars cheaper than everything else in their respective segments. And Le Vot also agrees with De Meo and Elkann: ‘CAFE requirements mostly concentrate on the exhaust pipe and the CO2 emission at that moment. But the life cycle assessment can give very different results; Look at an electric car in Poland with 100 per cent coal-originated electricity compared with something like a Hybrid somewhere else, for example.’ So, what happens now? For Group Renault and Stellantis, it’s still about selling cars – obviously – with De Meo framing it as a way to get dirty, unsafe older cars off the road in favour of cleaner, if not always zero-emission, ones. That said, Renault is already devising strategies to reduce the cost of small EVs, resulting in the and that will result. ‘A big step is to not have the punishment, but the necessity to do a better job and win competitiveness by investing in more than one technology,’ De Meo says at the Future of the Car summit. ‘The principle of technological neutrality has underpinned every regulation since forever – except for cars.’ Does this mean that the Renault Group and Stellantis are spearheading a small car revolution? The seed has already been planted, according to Le Vot. ‘We’re very happy that the European Commission, when they put the first set of legislations to us, said ‘let’s meet again to discuss the target,’’ he says, pointing out that De Meo’s suggestion of a lifecycle overview is on the table.

97,Stephen Bayley: why there will never be another clever small car quite like the Audi A2,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/audi-a2-stephen-bayley-history/,Stephen Bayley,2025-05-19,Car Magazine UK,"► In the words of architect Heinrich Tessenow, ‘The best is always simple but the simple is not always the best.’ Take the Audi A2, 25 this year and still superb. In some versions it was capable of 94mpg and had the lowest drag of any production mini ever. Aluminium construction meant it weighed just 900kg. Yet it was a sales disaster, reaching only a quarter of the numbers of the contemporary (but in every way inferior) Mercedes A-class. It’s an example of the German mastery not of efficiency itself, but the symbolism of it. All that sans serif public signage looks modern, but disguises systems of Kaiser-era antiquity. The deception is beautiful and mostly convincing. The A2 appears simple, but it is layered with layer after layer of meaning. Not really simple at all. Because it was willed into existence by VW Group chairman himself, the A2 escaped Audi’s bureaucracy, bypassing all rational audits, eventually to lodge itself in our memory as one of the most exquisite small cars ever. Rational? Actually, not at all. And therein lies its wonder. It is easy to say what went wrong. God, nature, call it what you will, drives a hard bargain. Aluminium has the benefit of lightness and corrodes less aggressively than many other metals. It is also a dream to recycle. But it is hard to work, requiring special tools and techniques. Insurance-company denials turned even minor A2 bump into write-offs. And then it was a death spiral. Of course, this is like complaining you can’t put fine Limoges porcelain in the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Practical considerations are not important with works of art. Aluminium was an A2 article of faith: a demonstration of magnificent – but futile – corporate ambition. It was expensive and scared consumers, even as it left a residue of genius. It is a design masterpiece. Attributing something as complex as a car to an individual is always problematic, but the Audi career chronologies of Luc Donckerwolke and Stefan Sielaff track the gestation period of the A2. Whoever it was, the A2 designer fully acknowledged the significance of J Mays’ Avus concept of 1991. That car established a language of design for Audi that lasted until five or six years ago. From the Avus, the A2 derived superlatively confident, but plain, surfaces beneath which lurked historical ghosts. Plus, exquisite details. These ghosts included experimental streamliners created by Paul Jaray, whose 1923 K-Typ Audi, like the A2, made no concessions to simplistic notions of elegance. In fact, it was pug ugly, but in a way that persuaded. In pursuit of the chimaera of ‘efficiency’, German designers often created some very peculiar-looking machines. Blohm & Voss made an asymmetric aircraft. Anybody who has seen a Hanomag truck of circa 1969 knows the German aesthetic. A ’63 Unimog says the same: I don’t have to be kiss-me-quick cute to be impressive. The thing about German design was this: while the Italians were, quite correctly, obsessed with bella figura, the serious business of looking good, Germans were obsessed by the serious business of trying to look serious. Germans believed in systematic design. The belief was that following carefully considered principles, a good result was inevitable. This was a theory which paid no attention at all to divinely-inspired ‘creativity’, but it did give us Dieter Rams and his white and black boxes for Braun. And he, in turn, gave us Apple’s Jony Ive. And in this region of design history we find the Audi A2. It is the iPod of the automobile. The A2 may be a design masterpiece, but it is more specifically a German design masterpiece. The national pre-occupation with systems and efficiency can perhaps be traced back to medieval guilds and their insistence on specialisation: thus in Solingen you found cutlers, in Mainz watch makers. Factor in the dominant Prussian idea of military efficiency and you have all the forces – by no means all ‘rational’ – which let Audi flourish. To be sure, the A2 is not a pretty car. That is like saying the Ossie athlete Katrin Krabbe was no beauty. But attractive and high-performance, certainly. Instead, the A2 speaks of seriousness. Of attention to detail, perhaps at the expense of attention to the larger picture. But we live with details, not with larger pictures. Making judgements about this car is a treacherous business. It was a commercial calamity. It has admirers rather than lovers. And instead of looking into the future, it is not so much a car of the 21st century as a thing of a long lost and much regretted past. But one thing is certain. No one will ever build a car quite like this again. As I write this, I am thinking of Brahms’ ."
98,Peugeot has ‘no appetite’ for being premium as it withdraws from large segment,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/peugeot/d-segment/,Ted Welford,2025-05-19,Car Magazine UK,"The boss  of has said he has ‘no intention or appetite’ to become a premium car brand as it withdraws from the large car segment as its 508 bows out of production. Following a similar decision at Citroen, which r to focus on more lucrative segments, Peugeot is now doing the same. Speaking to CAR, newly appointed Peugeot CEO Alain Favey emphasised Peugeot’s position of being ‘upper mainstream’ and that it had ‘potential to compete at a higher price in the mainstream segment’. But Favey was adamant Peugeot didn’t want to move any further upwards than that as a brand. ‘Clearly, we are a volume player, and our business model is based on reaching a high level of volume. But we don’t want to be premium, we have no intention or appetite for the premium market. We want to be in the volume segment, rather at the upper part of it,’ said Favey. While UK orders of the were closed in December 2024, production for other markets continued but will end for good later this month at Stellantis’ Rennes plant in north-western France. The factory will then solely focus on the new . ‘The 508 is stopping now,’ says Favey. ‘We don’t think we need a presence in the D segment in the future, we think we can cover it with solutions, which are more appropriate and which the business case is stronger.’ Favey points towards the new , saying it ‘offers even  more than what a D-segment customer might expect sometimes’. Peugeot has a slightly odd positioning within Stellantis – sitting above Fiat and Citroen at the more budget end but trying not to encroach on premium players DS and Alfa Romeo, despite the French firm quite notably moving upmarket in recent years. Favey is just over 100 days in as the boss of Peugeot, joining from hire car giant Europcar, where as CEO he oversaw the cyclical purchase of 50,000 Stellantis vehicles. His top priorities at Peugeot? Reconnecting with customers, partners and dealers comes first. Second is launching a wave of offers to help it get back on track with private buyers, which he says the firm has been ‘losing ground over the last few years’. His third priority is addressing quality issues with its cars, namely its catastrophically unreliable PureTech ‘wet belt’ engine. Stellantis as a whole has launched a new compensation scheme where former owners of cars fitted with their engine can claim for damages online. Favey said 60 per cent who go on the platform ‘get the compensation are they entitled to’. Peugeot has a big year ahead, and is doing well. It sold 400,000 cars in the first four months of 2025, eight per cent more than previous year, and sales of its new 3008 and 5008 are spearheading this growth. Plenty more is also in the pipeline, with with a hot version of its e-208, and a facelift of the firm’s bread-and-butter arriving later in the year.

99,Razor-sharp BMW breadvan concept teased ahead of Villa d’Este concours,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/bmw-breadvan-concept-heads-to-villa-d-este-2025/,Tim Pollard,2025-05-20,Car Magazine UK,"Mid-May and summer’s round the corner in Europe: must be time for the swanky concours d’elegance on the edge of Lake Como in Italy. And that means it’s time for the annual BMW concept car, designed to take centre stage at the Munich-supported car show. No word yet on the name of this year’s creation, but BMW has teased its new showstopper on its main . It looks like another sharp-creased shooting brake, designed in the mould of its latest concept cars. What’s not to like about that? Sporting estate cars are all the rage and fit right in with the chic Italian aesthetic of Villa d’Este – even if it sounds like a larger iteration of the 2023 also unveiled in Cernobbio. Observers have also drawn parallels to last year’s 2024 unveiled at Village d’Este 12 months ago, but we’re not so sure. The headlamp and rear light graphics and positioning don’t quite match, so our best bet is on a standalone concept car. BMW design supremo Adrian van Hooydonk shared this artfully blurred teaser on his own , revealing even less. Or is that a low-slung silhouette along the lines of a ? Whatever BMW’s readying for debut this weekend, our best bet is that it’ll be a fresh iteration of the fabled Z3 ‘breadvan’ coupe recipe – one of the coolest, stubbiest cars in Munich’s back catalogue of modern classics. Maybe expanded to the 8-series footprint, designed to challenge Porsche’s electric wagon? Note also how van Hooydonk references ‘ of our surprises’ at Villa d’Este this bank holiday weekend.

100,New Nissan Micra revealed as electric Renault 5 twin,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/micra/,Ted Welford,2025-05-21,Car Magazine UK,"Behold, this is the new Nissan Micra. Yes, the fabled choice of octogenarians is back for its sixth generation, and this time it’s a , and principally a rebodied version of the . Based on how good Renault’s new hit EV has proven, that should put the new Micra in good stead, especially with an interior and powertrains pretty much copied from the R5. It could be the best use of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance yet, but is the new Micra the magic bullet to solve ? Well, it certainly hopes so, and the new Micra is one of four new Nissan EVs due to launch by 2027, including the imminent arrival of the , which has evolved into a crossover (naturally), a new Juke and an A-segment EV based on . It’s only really the exterior that is the key differentiator to the Renault. Styled at Nissan’s design centre in London, the new Micra is similar to the R5 in that it sits higher up than a typical hatch, though it’s by no means a typical crossover to look at. Nissan had already shown a front exterior image of the new Micra but this is our first look at the full thing. It retains the distinctive lighting signature seen previously that runs from the bonnet into the front bumper, and the big circular headlights that the Micra has become known for. When unlocked the lights are said to perform a ‘welcome wink’. Around the rear, the bold circular lighting signature is replicated. Though Nissan’s designers have done a great job of putting their own stamp on the Micra’s design, it’s the side profile that gives away its Renault 5-ness, with a very similar profile. It also does without the bright yellow and green paints of its French cousin, with 18-inch alloys also fitted as standard. According to Nissan, the new Micra’s interior ‘recaptures a theme that has been at the heart of the model across all previous generations – simple, understated elegance’. That’s an interesting way of saying it basically just straight-copied the Renault 5’s interior. Yes, the twin 10.1-inch merged screens are the same, and even the steering wheel buttons are borrowed straight from the Renault. The Nissan emblem is one of the only obvious differences. We should say this is really quite good news – the interior is one of the best things about the R5, and especially its Google-powered touchscreen, which the Nissan retains – though it’s a shame Nissan didn’t put its own stamp on it. Dimensions are practically identical to the R5, so expect a similarly cramped interior for anyone not sat in the front seats, limited space in the back for adults and a 326-litre boot. Mirroring the Renault 5 line-up in the UK, the Micra will be available with a choice of two powertrains. The entry-level choice pairs a 40kWh battery with a 122bhp electric motor, and claims a 192-mile WLTP driving range. Above this is a 52kWh battery model, using a more powerful 148bhp motor and enabling a longer 252-mile trip between charging. Charging speeds of up to 100kW are available, and both models are able to charge from 15 to 80 pr cent in half an hour. A heat pump is also standard, as is vehicle-to-load technology, which allows external electrical devices to be charged using the car’s battery. While the Micra name is not one that stirs up excitement, it is one with plenty of memories attached. Many of a certain age had one as a first car, often the result of being passed down from an elderly grandparent. It’s now more than 40 years since the Micra arrived, and it remained a strong seller across its generations, though declined in its latter years. Nissan gave the Micra some well-needed street cred as part of the fifth-generation model in 2017, making it sleeker and lower, but even that couldn’t help it stay relevant, and production ended at the end of 2023. Nissan says the new Micra will ‘stay true to its guiding principles as a stylish and unpretentious car, which has underpinned its popularity and success’. Sales of the new Micra will start late in 2025, with pricing likely to be similar to the Renault 5, which starts from £22,995. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
101,The Fiat Grande Panda 4x4 concept previews a more rugged version of this supermini,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/fiat/grande-panda-4x4/,Ted Welford,2025-05-20,Car Magazine UK,"Is the Panda 4×4 making a comeback? New concept previews a more rugged model And doesn’t it look great? Fiat has revealed the Grande Panda 4×4 concept to showcase the potential for a more rugged version of its new supermini. Referred to as a ‘direct heir’ to the , a production model has not been confirmed but certainly looks to be on the cards. Revealed to coincide with first drives of the new , Fiat says the concept features an ‘electrified rear axle’, likely suggesting it’s a hybrid model rather full-electric, although this hasn’t been confirmed. Fiat offers its new chic city car with the choice of an 111bhp electric powertrain or as a 108bhp mild-hybrid model. Equipped with white steelies, a raised ride height and chunky roof rack housing a tool box and spare tyre, this concept certainly looks the part, and revives the rugged image that Fiat’s cult hero is renowned for. Its dark red hue also harks back to a special edition version of the 1983 original. Other details include new spotlights on the roof rack and front bumper in the same blocky signature that feature across Fiat’s new Grande Panda. A range of accessories are likely to feature on a production model. It’s the first time yet we’ve seen a four-wheel-drive version of a car based on Stellantis’ new ‘Smart Car’ platform, also used on the and . Four-wheel-drive will likely be supplied by a small 48-volt rear-mounted electric motor, replicating a similar setup found on . Prices for the new Grande Panda start from £21,035 for the electric model, making it one of the you can buy. Hybrid models have also recently had a price cut to £18,035 courtesy of a new entry-level Pop trim level. It swaps steel wheels instead of alloys and does without roof rails or privacy glass. First UK deliveries of the Grande Panda are expected in the summer. Fiat says “With its eyes set firmly on the future, the new Grande Panda 4×4 project is destined to be a manifesto for a fresh vision of sustainable mobility — a vision rooted in innovation, in line with current dictates, while maintaining the characteristics that made it a global cult favourite.” Hopefully this is a manifesto that actually comes to fruition… Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
102,"DS No4 revealed: sharp looks, smarter powertrains",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ds/no4/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-21,Car Magazine UK,"This is the new DS No4, the second new-look car from the brand following the . It’s effectively a heavy facelift for the DS4 but adds a few changes that Stellantis hopes will make it a clearer, more attractive option in the executive sector. This is the DS4, but not as we knew it.  Out is the DS4’s more conservative styling, and in is a face that’s designed to convey this car’s more premium aspirations. ‘On No4 we are bringing together the vertical and very slim V-shaped signature of the DRLs from our DS e-Tense Performance concept car,’ said Design director Theirry Metroz. ‘We were also inspired by our new flagship, No8, to create this horizontal light line that connects the lit-up grille to the illuminated DS badge,’ he added. ‘The combination gives a dramatic and easily recognizable result.’ With that in mind, the bonnet has been extended by 12mm and now eats into a new-look grille. On each side you’ll find a new light signature which borrows from DS’ recent e-Tense performance concept as well as its No8 flagship.  At the rear, expect the usual complex light designs and a floating roof. Overall, the No4 is 4400mm in length, 1870mm wide and 1470mm high. Changes are less dramatic inside, though now you get a 10.25-inch instrument cluster. The biggest change comes in the form of an all-new electric powertrain not previously offered with the DS4. It’ll extract a range of 280 miles WLTP from its conservatively sized 58.3bkWh battery (useable) and power is 210bhp with 253ft lbs of torque. It also includes a heat pump. The plug in hybrid powertrain returns, though now with an EV-only range 30% better than before. Its four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine makes 222bhp combined with an electric motor and seven-speed dual clutch auto ‘box. Finaly, the mild hybrid uses a compact 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbo and adds a small 28bhp e-motor bolted onto the six-speed box. It makes 143bhp altogether. CAR understands the new No4 should debut around the £35,000 mark, though we’ll update this story when we know more.

103,Crushing the coup: new Toyota RAV4 unveiled,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/rav4/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-21,Car Magazine UK,"The current has been around since 2019, which means it’s nearing the end of its life. For its first four years on sale, it was the default choice those looking for a large, dependable, . But the last two years haven’t been kind to the car. Its interior has dated quickly and its hybrid tech has been leapfrogged by fresher rivals, such as the . Toyota obviously isn’t best chuffed about losing its crown, so the brand has given us an early preview of what it hopes will restore the market to order. This is new, sixth-generation RAV4 – and it promises better interior technology, more safety equipment and a pair of upgraded plug-in hybrid powertrains with bigger battery packs and longer electric ranges. It won’t reach UK showrooms until 2026, which means Toyota hasn’t even thought about releasing pricing information yet. However, when it does eventually reach Britain, I reckon the most basic self-charging model will have a starting price of around £38,000, shunting into roughly the same bracket as the and hybrids. Scroll down to learn more about the car. No V8s, I’m afraid. It’s business as usual over at Toyota. Like before, the new RAV4 comes with a range of self-charging and plug-in hybrid powertrains, all of which are based on the same 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine as the outgoing car. To make sure they’re competitive, though, Toyota has revised all the electrical gubbins supporting them. There are two – a front-wheel drive model with 181bhp and a four-wheel drive model with 188bhp. Above that, there’s a new 264bhp front-wheel drive plug-in hybrid powertrain, before you arrive at the top-spec 300bhp four-wheel drive PHEV. Toyota hasn’t yet confirmed fuel economy figures, but the brand’s making some big promises. Plus, the RAV4 PHEV’s battery capacity has increased by 30% from 18.1kWh to 22.7kWh. Toyota says that change has bumped up the car’s maximum electric driving range from 46 miles to 62 miles. The battery also now supports 50kW DC rapid charging, meaning you can thrash it from 10 to 80 percent capacity in just 30 minutes at an EV charging station. If that isn’t enough, Toyota reckons the new RAV4 will be much better to drive than the outgoing car, as its battery pack is mounted under the floor of the cabin (like an EV) rather than being slung over the rear axle. That means better structural rigidity, better weight distribution and a lower centre of gravity. The new RAV4 shares the same rough layout as the previous car, but it’s decorated in fresh buttons and trims pilfered from the far newer . There’s also a new 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster with built-in maps and native warnings for speed cameras and low-emissions zones – useful if you’re trying to make the most of the car’s EV range. You get a fresh 12.9-inch infotainment system – and it seems Toyota’s engineers took heed of our complaints about the dangers of touchscreen-led climate controls when they were designing it. There are physical buttons under the screen for adjust the cabin temperature and a fixed hot bar at the bottom of the screen for the fan speed and direction controls. There’s a new voice command system that it says can programme navigation instructions, adjust the cabin temperature, change whatever media you’re listening to and perform ‘vehicle control commands,’ such as opening the windows. The new infotainment hardware is backed up by Toyota’s latest ‘Arene’ software. It marks the beginning of the company’s shift towards – and it’s enabled the launch of a faster, more streamlined version of Toyota’s in-car safety suite. Unlike the previous RAV4, this new model will feature front cross-traffic alert, lane-change assist and a pre-collision system that can recognise bicycles and motor bikes. In addition, Toyota has bolstered its blind-spot monitoring system with a warning buzzer that’ll sound if it senses a car approaching quickly from behind. Toyota has retained its flagship, race-inspired GR Sport trim level for the Mk6 RAV4. The car in these images wears the spec, sporting a 20mm wider track, firmer dampers, stronger rear bracing and retuned power steering. Toyota says these adjustments will make the car more ‘dynamic’ to drive. But this is the modern world, in which it’s pointless to own the range-topping model if bystanders can’t tell you’ve spent the extra money. So, the GR Sport also gets a more aggressive front bumper with a broader grille, lightweight 20-inch alloy wheels, black exterior trim and more GR Sport badges than you shake a chequered flag at. The cabin gets the same race-inspired treatment with a pair of sports seats, suede upholstery, a set of aluminium pedals and knee pads for the centre console, which are supposedly there to prevent you from pummelling your patella into a powder when you’re hammering down a country road. There’s one more thing worth flagging. As I mentioned above, the new RAV4 won’t reach UK showrooms until 2026. So, if you’re not the sort of person to gravitate towards the newest, shiniest trinkets like a magpie, watch out for some screaming deals on the outgoing car over the coming months as Toyota clears its showrooms for the new model.

104,Six months post-reboot: is Jaguar’s bold new era sticking the landing?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/jaguar/rebrand-six-months-on/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-21,Car Magazine UK,"Incredibly it’s been six months since Jaguar revealed its new look, and with it the . A to everything that’d come before, it reimagines the marque with very different look and feel. ‘What we set out to signal that the brand was changing,’ heavily understates Nick White, director of communications at Jaguar, talking to me at the Monaco round of the Formula E championship. Already a showcase for new technology, the all-electric series is now the perfect platform to continue Jaguar’s rebrand. JLR had a huge presence at this year’s round, with a pontoon showcasing its Type 00 concept just metres from the track. ‘It takes three to five years to transform brands,’ White tells me on the Jaguar team’s yacht ‘and we’re very early in that journey.’ Things kicked off in dramatic style in November, with a campaign devised by JLR and consultancy firm Accenture Song – but the whole process will take half a decade in total. ‘When we set up our reimagined strategy in 2021, we wanted to keep the new and old apart,’ White explains. The initial launch was designed to disrupt, defy and reinvent Jaguar as an exciting, all-electric premium brand. Think of it as the new Bentley for techy millionaires and you’re pretty much there. The format for this marketing Ctrl+Alt+Del was a visually punchy advert and the launch of a bold new design language. To that end, the bold Type 00 concept was shown alongside the new campaign and it previewed production that’ll riff off the same design language. After that, we’ll probably get a couple of SUVs because that’s where the volume and profit is. Even though it’s a crucial pillar to Jaguar’s ongoing reinvention, the marketing power of Formula E feels like a drop in the ocean compared to the seismic effect of the reset that took place around half a year before. ‘We had an incredible reaction,’ says White, rounding up the positive, negative and at times deeply worrying reactions the campaign generated. However, in numeric terms and eyeballs reached, the campaign was a huge success and overwhelmingly positive. ‘We had nearly a billion impressions on PR, on social media, OTS (opportunity to see) and social impressions – and we spent pretty much nothing on marketing,’ he says. ‘If you said to me in early November, we were going to be the most talked about brand in the world for six weeks I’d have laughed.’ Brands will do anything they can to remain in the public eye and for six weeks JLR and Accenture Song were able to drag Jaguar out of the doldrums and onto front pages, smartphone alerts and social posts. They weren’t all positive – but the phrase ‘no such thing as bad publicity’ was surely made for situations such as these. Or was it?  Interestingly, just days after our chat, suggest Jaguar wasn’t satisfied with its rebranding campaign and is looking for a new consultancy firm to partner with. With the fallout, or momentum – depending on your opinion – of the rebrand still in full swing, Jaguar is now embarking on a world tour via Formula E with its new brand and concept. ‘We see it as a good way to amplify the brand,’ says White of the series. He’s right, of course; the Jaguar team won the Constructor’s title last year, with both its drivers in a shout of the Drivers’ title until the last round. ‘It brings us to another audience, a younger audience, a more digitally connected audience, and that’s important to us as well.’ The thinking is simple: find a new audience, show them the brand’s new look, and learn how to supercharge interest in each market. It’s preparation and homework for when the first production car is revealed. ‘We talk about China, where luxury customers are in their early 30s, and they spend their life on WeChat,’ White adds. ‘You’ve got around a billion views a day on WeChat. We’re learning how you take the main strategy and tailor it to the market in terms of the messaging and the media mix.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

105,Hyundai: a car maker that gives a damn,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/hyundai/ev-consumer-strategy/,Jake Groves,2025-05-22,Car Magazine UK,"After a genuinely fun electric car for the enthusiast? No one does it better right now than Hyundai. Want interesting and attractive car for the family, fitted with clever details and ‘I hadn’t thought of that’ touches? Call Hyundai. How about a brand that’s smartly playing the field when it comes to powertrain options, instead of putting all its eggs in the battery-electric basket? Hyundai’s got everything covered. It’s no wonder the brand has just built its 100 millionth car faster than any other manufacturer: Hyundai is making cars people actually want, whether you’re an enthusiast or not. By comparison, almost every other car maker seems to be simply going through the motions. The saturated supercar and hypercar market seems to have hit a ceiling of interest, given the relative ambivalence on social media to recent launches. Some are so embattled with regulation and geopolitics that certain new models being released feel like compromises. Others are so obsessed with their bottom line that all of their cars seem to look and feel the same. Do feel free to make your own assumptions about what manufacturers link to these points. Hyundai, very much like Toyota, has persistently sweated the small stuff and hasn’t neglected the car enthusiast – and it’s getting sweet rewards for doing so. Most of its cars are attractive, or at least eye-catching, without looking aggressive. ‘Beauty, not botox! Just be beautiful!’ says Simon Loasby, head of the Hyundai design centre. ‘Getting down to the essentials suddenly becomes incredibly attractive.’ The latest is a genuine family car triumph, and the brand isn’t scared of venturing into new kinds of cars: it’s carved out a niche with the Santa Cruz pick-up that helped it set sales records in North America. N still holds a torch for combustion in certain markets with the fabulously fun . Then there’s the : such an engaging electric sports car that it even held its own during our 2024 Sports Car Giant test full of combustion heroes. The brand isn’t done, either: a production version of the N Vision 74 and a new hydrogen fuel cell model to succeed the NEXO are both on the way, as is an Ioniq 6 N. There’s also a sense of humour beneath the surface. The RN24 is its latest skunkworks project: a mutated Inster lookalike built out of WRC-spec scaffolding and… precious little else. A distraction, you might think, but no. Think of the RN22e from 2022 – essentially an Ioniq 6 N in disguise, and a test bed for N’s e-Shift and N Sound+ that have helped to make the Ioniq 5 N so engaging. The RN24 demonstrates the possibilities of a smaller, lighter N hot hatch that has the same size battery as the 5 N – complete with rally-spec suspension and even a fully drift-spec electric handbrake. It’s not about the performance numbers, but ‘prioritising the driving experience,’ says Joon Park, vice president of the N management group. ‘Who knows – our 200 millionth car might be powered by a battery or hydrogen, might be self-driving or even self-flying,’ smiles chief operating officer, Jose Munoz. However it comes about – we’re convinced it’ll be built by people who actually care. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017. With a decade of car news and reviews writing under his belt, he became CAR's Deputy News Editor in 2020 and then News Editor in 2025.

106,Wait. So hybrids are bad again?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/hybrids-bad-again/,Nick Gibbs,2025-05-23,Car Magazine UK,"Here’s what sounds like some excellent news from JLR: global sales of its plug-in hybrids soared 163 per cent in the three months ending in December 2024. In the world of legislation-driven electrification, however, a spike in growth like this coming as it does so late in the year is less a cause for celebration and more a clanging alarm. It almost certainly means an important global market decided from the start of the new year to shut the door on some loophole or incentive that, for a while, gave an electrified drivetrain a boost. And so it proved here. France, that inveterate hater of big SUVs, had widened the net for its weight-based ‘malus’ tax penalty on heavier cars to include plug-in hybrids. Car makers scrambled to push out cars before the tax hit and as a result France in December became briefly the largest PHEV market in Europe, with sales up 45 per cent. Land Rover finished second in the PHEV chart, with sales up 600 per cent to 3899 for the month, according to figures from market analyst Dataforce via Automotive News Europe. The tax change from 1 January adds €18,830 to the price of the best-selling Range Rover Sport P460E plug-in hybrid in France and effectively kills the market for large premium SUVs, which was 90 per cent plug-in hybrid last year according to Dataforce. France yanking away the football illustrates the perils for the plug-in hybrid in Europe. A similar thing happened in Belgium at the beginning of 2024 when company cars were targeted. The result? One of the biggest PHEV markets in Europe, with over 100,000 sales in 2023, tumbled 33 per cent last year according to figures from European lobby group ACEA. PHEV sales did increase in the UK last year by 18 per cent to 167,178, led by the Ford Kuga, as car makers squeezed all the flexibilities available within the ZEV mandate (setting the percentage of EVs manufacturers need to sell) to stay compliant. However, it wasn’t enough to grow overall sales across Europe, which fell 3.9 per cent to just under a million, half that of pure EVs. The drivetrain is billed as a useful bridging technology to electric in that you get a fairly big battery for local EV driving but also a combustion engine to salve those range worries on longer trips. The way the WLTP emission tests work means that even hefty PHEVs like the Range Rover Sport record far lower carbon dioxide figures than humble hybrid superminis, leading to tax incentives almost as good as those for EVs. But the European Union is very suspicious of the drivetrain and last year published a report based on data harvested from 2021 PHEVs showing that real-world emissions were on average 3.5 times worse than officially declared. The green cloak was whipped off, Scooby Doo style, to reveal just another combustion-engined car. In response the EU has changed the way it measures emissions on PHEVs starting from 1 January this year for newly launched vehicles and a year later for cars already on sale. In effect this doubles the recorded CO2 for PHEVs, risking them straying out of their precious low-impact company-car tax brackets. The car industry has responded by increasing the size of the battery, so for example the pack in the new VW Tiguan eHybrid jumps to 19.7kWh, nearly doubling the quoted electric range from the old one at 62 miles. That of course adds cost, meaning the Tiguan PHEV starts at £42,555, over £5000 more than a standard 1.5-litre petrol. It’s also only two grand shy of the long-range electric VW ID. 4. All this sounds like the plug-in hybrid is on borrowed time. In any case, the official position from both the EU and UK is that the sale of all cars with combustion engines stops from 2035. But while some company car drivers still have trouble unwrapping the charging cable, the ‘fake EV’ (in the words of one influential green pressure group) remains a very useful introduction to electric motoring to a whole class of EV sceptics worldwide.

107,Aston Martin Valhalla: Mid-engined supercar hits Monte Carlo,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/valhalla/,Piers Ward,2025-05-23,Car Magazine UK,"It’s alive! Aston Martin has given the Valhalla its global dynamic debut ahead of the 2025 Monaco GP. Driven by none other than Aston’s F1 driver and two-time champion Fernando Alonso, the Valhalla circulated before the first practice session of the day – and it made for some stunning imagery. ‘Having followed this project closely for the past 18 months and working alongside the development team, unveiling Valhalla’s dynamic capability to the world at the Monaco Grand Prix weekend is a fantastic moment for both myself and the brand,’ said Alonso. ‘Outside of the outright power and dynamics, it delivers on all of the raw feelings and emotions you look for when behind the wheel of a car like Valhalla.’ Just 999 units will be. Made, with deliveries taking place in the second half of this year. For everything else you need to know about the Valhalla, keep reading. A marked change for Aston Martin. Never before has the company built a ‘proper’ mid-engined car – let’s gloss over the – and nor has it ever done a plug-in hybrid before. It’s also the first use for this particular V8, a 4.0-litre twin turbo unit that starts life at Mercedes-AMG but is, Aston insists, bespoke to the British firm. It is, in its words, ‘not a crate motor’. What the Valhalla has done is create a car that allows Aston to shout about its twin pillars of luxury with F1-inspired technology. By moving the frame of reference away from simply front-engined GTs, admittedly of varying degrees of focus, all of a sudden Lawrence Stroll’s Aston eco system starts to make more sense. The headline numbers are impressive. 1064bhp and 811lb ft put it on a par with other exotica like the , in Aston’s case derived from a combination of a flat-plane crank V8 and 6kWh battery powering three e-motors (two on the front axle, one at the rear within the transmission). The engine is good for 817bhp and is mated to an all-new eight-speed dual clutch gearbox. Pace is 217mph and 0-62mph in 2.5 seconds. Aero? Plenty. 600kg of downforce from 150mph, thanks to a combination of a retractable rear wing and further active wings at the front. The Valhalla also borrows Aston’s F1 knowhow for a DRS function and the rear wing can double as an air brake. The clever bit is that it will maintain that downforce level all the way up to the car’s maximum speed thanks to the wings gradually adjusting their trim to bleed out of the excess downforce as the speed rises. Eco? Ish. Thanks to the small battery, EV-only running is possible, for just over eight miles and up to 80mph. Supercar makers seem to be split on this strategy, some opting for EV-only running and others insisting that it leads to too many compromises. Ferrari even does both, with the SF90 and . Either way, Aston’s set-up should allow it to make the most of the low-inertia twin turbos in combination with the e-motors, delivering instant torque and allowing for torque vectoring on the front axle. Unlike Ferrari or Porsche, there’s no e-motor housed within the turbo itself. It’s definitely more circuit-focused than other Astons, but, according to Simon Newton, director of brand performance, it also rides well. ‘It has traditional Aston free travel in its primary context so it breathes with the road… [and] it also stands out with very good isolation from impacts.’ There’s double wishbone pushrod suspension up front (inboard springs and dampers make the air cleaner in that area) and the rear is a multi-link set-up. Billstein dampers all-round that link to the other systems like the aero and powertrain, to ensure that the car remains as stable as possible. No twin-valve dampers here, because, as Newton points out, ‘ours is a very performance-orientated system. Twin-valve dampers are more if you want ride comfort.’ Alonso’ seating position. The Valhalla comes with one-piece carbon fibre seats and a laid-back, F1-style seating position to make the most of the link to the Aston F1 team. Even the steering wheel draws links from it. It’s from within here that you can cycle through the various drive modes – Eco, Sport, Sport+ and Race. Note no ‘normal’. Default is Sport while Race puts the rear wing in maximum attack mode.

108,The BMW Concept Speedtop is an M8-based shooting brake we’d love to own,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/concept-speedtop/,Ted Welford,2025-05-23,Car Magazine UK,"BMW’s car designs in recent years have been controversial to say the least, but it appears the German marque still knows how to design a great car with the reveal of its new Concept Speedtop. Unveiled at the 2025 , which BMW is the organiser of, it is essentially a hard-top version of the shown at last year’s event, with both being based on a . The BMW Concept Speedtop is the latest in an annual tradition for BMW to show off a new concept car at Villa d’Este, previous examples of which include the . The Speedtop’s design is unsurprisingly very similar to the Skytop, with its V-shaped front end having clear links to the BMW 507, one of the German firm’s most valuable classic models. It also uses the thinnest LED lights ever fitted to a BMW and has an illuminated kidney grille (naturally). The sloping roofline and extended window line give it the perfect ‘shooting brake’ look, with BMW describing it as a ‘Touring’. Adrian van Hooydonk, head of BMW Group design, said: ‘A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still. And that’s also the case with our new concept car. ‘The BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive segment. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire line-up of vehicles, especially for the Touring models.’ Inside, there’s no hiding its 8-series roots in the cabin, but BMW has kitted it out with a posh twin-colour leather finish. The boot is also finished in full leather and has brogue-style perforations. A fancy false boot floor reveals a much larger storage area beneath. The 8-series’ rear seats are ripped out and in their place are two cut-outs for bespoke luggage made by Italian firm Schedoni, designed to match the finish of the rest of the interior. A weekend bag can also fit in the boot. Munich hasn’t provided any technical details for the BMW Concept Speedtop, but has said it uses the firm’s most powerful V8 engine – meaning it gets the same 4.4-litre twin-turbo unit as the , putting out 616bhp and 553lb ft of torque, enabling a 0-62mph time of 3.2 seconds. While BMW didn’t reveal last year’s Concept Skytop as a production vehicle, it was soon after confirmed that 50 examples would be made. This time, the company has confirmed that low-volume production is on the cards. The Concept Speedtop will be marginally less rare, with 70 set to be produced from the outset. That’ll certainly make for some pretty arresting family transport for the discerning BMW collector. BMW says it is offering them to ‘collectors and enthusiasts’. There’s no word on when production will begin, or pricing, but it’s likely to cost around £500,000, according to CAR magazine’s sources.

109,"Volvo XC70: new PHEV specs revealed, China only for now",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volvo/xc70-phev/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-05-27,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo may be focusing on its electric range of EX cars, but it’s not finished with the internal combustion just yet. After refreshing the XC90 and the XC60, the Swedish brand has now teased a new XC70. Although it shares its name with Volvo’s more rugged estate, it’s now going to be a ‘mid-size SUV format, slightly larger and more spacious than the Volvo XC60.’ As the name suggests, it’s designed to sit between the XC60 and XC90 and these new pictures show a typically clean design that fits somewhere between the two. Volvo says it’ll initially be launched in China, where it’ll plug a gap for a long-range hybrid car in the current line-up. It’ll be built on the new SMA platform, and should have a range of around EV-only 124 miles (CLTC). ‘The XC70 marks our strategic entry into the extended-range plug-in hybrid segment, a perfect bridge to full electrification,’ said Håkan Samuelsson, the president and chief executive of Volvo. ‘It enables us to maintain and develop a balanced product portfolio, while offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars. This is also an example of regionalisation, where we adapt to the local market needs.’ The XC70’s imminent release means it has now appeared on China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology database – and that means we know some of its specifications. It’ll measure 4815mm long, 1890mm wide and 1650mm tall, making it 138mm shorter than the XC90’s 2953 length. The all-electric ES90 is 5000mm, for context. Powertrain-wise, the new SUV will use a 161bhp 1.5-litre turbo in combination with two batteries – a 21.2kWh pack, or a 39.6kWh unit. Weight is said to be 2540kg. Volvo states a demand for PHEVs in China, but a global cooling for EVs means the XC70 could well come to Europe in time. We’ll update this article when we know more.

110,A heavier sort of lightness: Alpine A390 SUV launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a390/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-27,Car Magazine UK,"I’m growing rather tired of watching performance car brands pivot into SUVs. Almost every great sports car manufacturer, from Aston Martin to Porsche, has leapt on the bandwagon – and now Alpine, the final bastion of the lightweight sports car, has caved under the weight of popularism. Meet the all-new, all-electric A390 SUV. Alpine won’t admit it’s built an SUV, mind. Despite my protestations at the reveal event in Dieppe, the brand insists on calling this car a ‘sport fastback.’ That irks me somewhat. At least have the good grace to own the segment you’ve stepped into, Alpine. But I should set my personal prejudices aside because, as much as I lament the SUV-isation of the car industry, I can’t criticise Alpine for chasing its margins. At the end of the day, SUVs are prevalent sort of car on the road right now. Plus, if Alpine wants to meet its ambitious plan of successfully launching seven new cars in seven years (a project that started 2023), current legislation dictates it needs to evolve or die. Keep scrolling to find out how much weight the new A390 has on its shoulders. Alpine’s press material says the A390 is based on an ‘original architecture’ but, after nailing a few chassis engineers to the wall with questions, I found out it’s actually a heavily revised version of the platform you’ll find under the Renault Scenic. The changes are quite dramatic, however. Instead of just one electric motor at the front, like you get in the Scenic, you get three motors spread around the chassis. There’s one on the front axle and one mounted to each wheel at the rear. Alpine offers two versions of the A390. The most basic GT model has 395bhp, a 0–62mph time of 4.8 seconds and a top speed of 124mph. The flagship GTS develops 464bhp and 596lb ft of torque, hacking its 0–62mph time down to 3.9 seconds and increasing its top speed to 137mph. Both feature an 89kWh battery pack. Alpine says that’s enough for a maximum range of 345 miles on the car’s standard 20-inch alloys, or 323 miles if you step up to the car’s bling-tastic 21-inch wheels. To try eke as much efficiency out of the battery as possible, every version of the SUV also comes with a heat pump as standard. It charges quickly, too. Connect the A390 to a 190kW DC rapid charger and you’ll be able to thrash the battery from 15 to 80% capacity in less than 25 minutes. That time seems well judged to me. That’s about as long as I’m prepared to spend having a coffee on a long drive. Plus, because the A390 supports vehicle-to-load, you can use its battery to power external appliances or save money on your bills by selling power back to the grid. Alpine even offers an optional adaptor that lets you transfer charge into an electric bike. Oh yes – and there needs to be to handle the heft. The car weighs not-so inconsiderable 2,121kg, but the brand’s engineers kept banging on about how the car will have a ‘feeling of lightness.’ Supposedly, Alpine’s boffins have managed to defy the laws of physics with some clever suspension tuning and torque-vectoring witchcraft. Alpine says the two rear motors can spin up independently of one another to encourage the car to rotate into corners and offset its inertia. The amount of torque sent to each rear wheel can also differ depending on how much steering lock you’ve wound in, which is supposed to help combat understeer. Alpine reckons this tech makes the car seem nimbler than its gravity would suggest. It says this SUV can closely ‘replicate the agility, lightness, and stability of the A110’ – but I’m sceptical. Obviously, I’ll withhold my judgement until I’ve driven it, but I’m yet to encounter an electric performance car that feels truly lightweight. Even the , which is the gold standard for the class, can’t hide its weight when you’re throwing it around. But now, I’d like to step down from my soap box for a moment and praise Alpine’s aerodynamic engineering. There are some truly inspired aero touches peppered around the car, such as flaps behind the rear wheels that expel turbulent air, an exceptionally shallow 17-degree roof angle (unheard of in the realm of coupe-SUVs) and a rear diffuser inspired by Daytona racers that not only benefits downforce but also reduces drag. You can see where Alpine has tried to mirror the A110 inside. The A390’s centre console is a similar shape and it sports the same drive mode selector buttons. There’s are several commonalities with Renault, too – most noticeably with the infotainment setup. You get the same 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and 12.0-inch portrait infotainment system as the Scenic, which is no bad thing because those screens are excellent. The switchgear is all pinched from the Renault parts bin, too, which I also like because it means you get Renault’s fantastically logical ‘MyPerso’ switch above the driver’s right knee, allowing you to disengage lane assist with a single prod. To try and inject a bit of its motorsport heritage, Alpine made a few tweaks to the A390’s steering wheel. There are two extra switches you won’t find on any Renault – a button marked ‘OV’ (which, amusingly, stands for ‘overtake’) and an F1-inspired rotary controller that allows you to adjust the level of brake regen without digging through endless menus. What’s more, if you’re prepared to spend a bit of money on the top-spec model, you get a pair of Sabelt sports seats. I’ve tried Sabelt’s seats in the new Alfa Romeo Junior and the Alpine A110 R – and both are utterly brilliant. They’re comfortable and fantastically supportive, so I’ve got high hopes for the Sabelts in this Alpine. Orders for the new Alpine A390 will open in November 2025, with prices expected to start from around £60,000 for the GT model and £70,000 for the GTS. The first cars are due to arrive on UK shores by Q2 2026 – and Alpine is hoping it can steal sales from the likes of the , and .

111,BMW’s new M2 CS brings back the ducktail,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m2-cs/,Jake Groves,2025-05-29,Car Magazine UK,"BMW’s unveiled its latest M2 CS – the angriest version of its already rather aggy baby sports car. The new model was revealed as part of the brand’s line-up at the swanky 2025 Villa d’Este concourse event at Lake Como. If you’re the switched-on sort of car enthusiast who reads CAR, you’ll almost certainly know what the M2 CS is about. It’s lighter, more powerful and comes with some rather choice upgrades to push the M2’s performance envelope further. It all starts with an upgraded turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six, developing 522bhp and 479lb ft. That’s good for a 0-62mph sprint over with in 3.8 seconds – proper supercar speeds – and a LIMITED top speed of 188mph. It’s not just about power, though. CS versions ride 8mm lower than standard M2 models, with BMW saying the stability control and, steering, limited-slip differential and brakes have all been specifically calibrated to CS spec. Optional carbon ceramic brakes will make sure your CS makes every turn on track smoothly. Carbonfibre is thrown at the CS, with BMW claiming this is the lightest version of the current-gen M2. Up to 30kg has been shed via a carbonfibre tailgate, roof panel and a whopping great spoiler integrated into the boot lid. Inside, much of BMW’s M tech applies here, including customisable mode buttons, a track lap timer, ten-stage traction control for allowing the biggest skids and – to that end – a Drift Analyser that’ll even give you stars for your powerslides.

112,Skoda’s design team reimagine the Favorit as an EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/favorit/,Jake Groves,2025-05-29,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda’s design team have dug deep into the brand’s modern history, reimagining the Favorit supermini as an electric car. The Favorit hatchback was originally launched in 1987, and helped transform Skoda from Eastern Bloc minnow to the VW Group-owned European powerhouse it is today. While this was still during the era of Skoda being the butt of unreliability jokes, this was arguably the fulcrum for Skoda’s rise and modern-day success. Skoda’s design team have pondered the return of the Favorit via this design study, led by designer Ljudmil Slavov. The new Favorit design concept is super clean, simple, boxy and has been deliberately crafted not to use Skoda’s current ‘Modern Solid’ design language seen on cars like the new and . ‘The Favorit was actually ‘Modern Solid’ in its own way,’ says Slavov. ‘It was a fairly simple car for the general public, both technically and in terms of shape. ‘I didn’t want to use current elements, such as the Tech-Deck Face mask . This is supposed to be a celebration of Favorit, so I traced its original details and tried to work with them, move them, elevate them,’ Slavov adds. Slavov and the design team crafted various design iterations, even showing off ones with what looks like plastic bumpers and different headlights – and even a rally-inspired one that echoes the WRC version that won the Monte Carlo, RAC, Finnish 1000 Lakes and Acropolis rallies in 1989. The final iteration includes plenty of smart and clean details, with the intention to show off as many modernised design details from the original Favorit as possible. ‘The doors, for example, are uniquely designed. They have one common handle built into the mass of the car and divided in the middle of the doors, which then open towards each other,’ says designer David Stingl. Generally, though, Skoda’s showing this car off entirely as a design study. That said, Skoda’s product portfolio doesn’t include a hatchback in the near future; the brand could take advantage of the VW Group MEB Entry platform used by the upcoming new to create a production version of the Favorit design study. A prospective production version would also have to content with a growing number of small electric cars from other brands. Renault, for example, is resurrecting the with and versions using the same technology to follow. Stellantis is launching a number of small EVs, too – with the and hitting the value-focused supermini space. There’s even to consider – another Eastern Bloc car that’s making a comeback as a combustion and EV model. Interesting times – and one that Skoda could take advantage of.

113,Alpine lays out plans for a 1000bhp V6 hybrid supercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alpine/supercar/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-05-30,Car Magazine UK,"It seems Alpine has gone quite mad. The brand is charging into its electrification strategy with cars like the , and the upcoming electric replacement for the – but the company’s CEO, Phillipe Krief, still thinks there’s room for a petrol-powered supercar at the top of the range. And good grief, has he set his sights high. At the international launch of the A390 SUV, he told me his engineers are working on a 1000bhp rival, powered by a V6 hybrid system that’s been developed by . For the uninitiated, that’s a tuning firm formed from the remnants of Alpine’s Formula One engine programme. Krief told us: ‘It won’t be a plug-in, but it will be a hybrid because we need more power, you know? On the rear it will be ICE, but it will be four-wheel drive and so we will have the axle on the front with two motors.’ Alpine also won’t take a leaf out of Ferrari’s book and outsource the development of its motors to Yasa. It’ll design its motors in-house. That front twin-motor setup is similar to the ’s – and Alpine says the system will be able to provide a torque-vectoring effect to help drag the nose of the car into the apex of a corner. What’s more, Krief said the entire car will weigh less than 1,600kg. That’s positively anorexic by modern supercar standards. The supercar will likely take some design, chassis and engineering inspiration from the – the brand’s first foray into hydrogen combustion power. In 2024, the brand even presented a V6-engined version of the car (pictured) and, at the time of its reveal, Alpine hinted the powertrain ‘could be transposed to series production.’ I should also mention the supercar falls outside the bounds of Alpine’s planned range of before the end of the decade. Because it’s such a small volume (and, frankly, rather special) project, Alpine didn’t want to tie it to its range of electric cars. Once I’d learned Alpine currently only makes 11 cars every day at its Dieppe factory (Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg plant churns out thousands in the timeframe), I wasn’t at all surprised to learn this supercar will be built in very limited numbers. Because of that exclusivity, I suspect it’ll also be astronomically expensive. Krief wouldn’t be drawn on a figure, but he reckons there’s plenty of space in the market for Alpine is he’s tactical. ‘If we fight with the performance,’ he said, ‘what is this price? It’s certainly not the same than the one for Ferrari. It’s certainly not the same than the one for Porsche. But there’s room.’ I reckon it’ll be positioned just far enough below the £450,000 Lamborghini Revuelto to make it look attractive without appearing cheap. I chucked a potential starting price of €200,000 at him, to which he said: ‘For the supercar? €200,000 for a supercar? It’s not enough. No, you know there’s a big correlation between the volume and the price. We need to make exclusivity, you know. ‘Everything is about profitability. We want profitability with two digits. Above ten percent. And so, it means low investment, higher price and then to be reasonable with the volume because all what we are doing is always taking the lower hypothesis or volumes because otherwise you overpromise, you don’t do and then you are in a mess.’ We’ll update you as the story develops, but the early signs suggest Maranello might finally have a reason to be afraid of Dieppe.

114,ACCESS DENIED: new Jeep Cherokee won't be coming to the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jeep/cherokee/,CJ Hubbard,2025-05-30,Car Magazine UK,"There’s a new Jeep Cherokee and these are the first official pictures. The next-generation Cherokee is described as ‘reimagined from the ground-up’ and its goal will be to keep this fabled American marque competitive in the mid-size – the most popular segment in the brand’s North American home market. And that’s important, as according to our contact at Jeep UK, the Cherokee is currently planned as a US-only model. That’s right, it’s not even confirmed for Europe at this stage, let alone right-hand drive UK. Which might be a shame, actually, as it looks good in the pics we’ve seen so far and Jeep is talking up the Cherokee’s ‘new, efficient and powerful’ hybrid drivetrain. On the other hand, the previous model hasn’t been sold here since 2018, and we haven’t missed it much… Nothing much. The Cherokee slots into the line-up between the and the , and is a similar prospect to the , and .

Though at this stage Jeep has only referenced the hybrid system. According to new Jeep CEO, Bob Broderdorf: ‘The all-new Jeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream line up.’ The previous Jeep boss, Antonio Filosa, has just been made CEO of Stellantis as a whole, . Jeep says the new Cherokee ‘is set to arrive in late 2025’. We’ve been told ‘never say never’ about European sales, but it’s very unlikely this one will make it to the UK.

115,Another manual bites the dust: the Toyota Aygo X goes hybrid,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/aygo/,Ted Welford,2025-06-02,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has given its tiny Aygo X a mid-life update, swapping out its small petrol engine for the hybrid powertrain from the . It will be the on sale in the UK when it arrives later in 2025, though does mean that another car with a manual gearbox bites the dust as the current 1.0-litre naturally aspirated unit is discontinued. Though many manufacturers have pulled out of the city car ‘A-segment’, Toyota remains committed, and has sold almost 300,000 since its 2022 introduction. The Aygo X will use the same 114bhp 1.5-litre petrol-electric hybrid setup from the larger and more expensive Yaris and , though has been adapted because of the Aygo’s tight packaging. The two stacks of battery cells are positioned alongside each other underneath the rear seats, rather than Toyota’s usual parallel arrangement, and the auxiliary battery is now found under the boot storage to not impede on space. The setup puts out 114bhp, a significant 43bhp more than before, with Toyota saying 0-62ph takes ‘less than 10 seconds’. Fuel economy figures beyond 70mpg are also expected, while Toyota says it will have CO2 emissions of 86g/km, the lowest of any car that doesn’t need to be plugged in. A big improvement in drivability is expected, with the previous 1.0-litre engine really having to be thrashed to get any performance from it – think cheap Spanish hire car and you’ll get the idea. Toyota says it also made the Aygo quieter and more comfortable with more noise insulation included, particularly on top-spec model which get thicker glass. The Aygo X also gets a new front end with sharp new LED headlights and a new front bumper, which also gives the car a 76mm longer front overhang to accommodate the larger hybrid powertrain. It also gets a new bonnet, while a retractable canvas roof remains available as an option. Its colours are also inspired by ‘mellow spices’, with Cinnamon, Jasmine, Tarragon and Lavendar colours all introduced. Toyota is also introducing a GR Sport trim level. Said to ‘inspired by its motorsport teams’, we’ll have to reserve judgement to see if there’s more to it than just its two-tone colour scheme, black bonnet, specific grille and GR Sport alloy wheels. Toyota does promise it’s more fun to drive courtesy of redesigned suspension and a sharper response from the power steering. Did someone say GR Aygo X hot hatch? By mid-life facelift standards, the Aygo X’s revisions are pretty significant, though changes to the interior are more limited. A seven-inch digital instrument cluster is introduced, while the heater control panel has been borrowed from the Yaris. A new wireless smartphone charger is also fitted to higher-spec cars. You’ll have to wait until the end of 2025 to get your hands on the new Aygo X, with prices and specifications still to be announced. Expect a healthy increase on top of the outgoing car’s £16,845 starting price. We expect it to be available from around £20,000, usefully undercutting the entry-level Yaris’s £23,445 price.

116,New Bentayga Speed is Bentley’s driftable hooligan-spec flagship SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bentley/bentayga-speed/,Jake Groves,2025-06-02,Car Magazine UK,"Bentley says this new Bentayga Speed is its most powerful and ‘most dynamic’ SUV ever, saying that significant chassis improvements have been made. The new flagship Bentayga model now features a V8 – rather than a W12 – and remains Hybrid-free, unlike . Here, a new version of the 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 is used, developing 641bhp and 627lb ft. Bentley says this drops the 0-60mph time down to 3.4 seconds – compared to 3.9sec for the old W12-powered Bentayga Speed, and 4.4sec for the . It’s not just about power, though. The car’s Sport mode has been overhauled with sharper steering responses and a 15 per cent increase in damper stiffness. The Speed now includes all-wheel steering for quicker responses in corners. Then things get proper hooligan-ish, as Bentley says the ESC Sport program allows for big power oversteer drifts – yes, really. Go ham with the options list and you can spec carbon ceramic brakes and, more importantly, an Akrapovič exhaust – something that will almost certainly startle the race horses in the stables. Muted design differences include unique wheel designs (22s are standard, 23s are an option) and headlights. Inside, bespoke quilting on the seats as well as Speed stitching and plaques.

117,Facelifted Kia Sportage for Europe revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/sportage/,Ted Welford,2025-06-04,Car Magazine UK,"Kia’s smash-hit has had a mid-life facelift, getting the bold grille from the and more technology in the process. It’s the first time we’ve seen the European Sportage facelift, following the reveal of the global version at last year’s LA Auto Show. Versions of the SUV destined for other markets, such as the US, Asia and Australia, have a longer wheelbase than those in Europe and a different rear end. The Sportage now adopts Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design language, rolled out on everything from its to the Sorento and in the ICE world, with this new model’s front end looking a lot like those latter two cars. Highlights are a wider grille and striking new LED headlights and GIANT front indicators. New front and rear bumpers are also fitted, while a range of new alloy wheel designs are available depending on trim level. Moving inside, the Sportage’s most notable revision is a two-spoke steering wheel, while a head-up display is also available on the SUV for the first time. New seat covers are also fitted, with more recycled material used in the suede inserts on the most popular GT-Line and GT-Line S trim levels. The Sportage’s striking 12.3-inch curved panoramic displays remain, as do its dual-purpose buttons, which can flick between controlling media and climate functions at the press of a button. It’s a good way of keeping physical controls while reducing the clutter. The revised bumpers add 2.5cm to the Sportage’s length, now measuring 4.54m in length, with interior dimensions unchanged. As before, you get a practical 587-litre boot, expanding to 1,776 litres with the rear seats folded. Family SUV box ticked. Kia has also tweaked the Sportage’s engine range. From launch it will be available as a 148bhp 1.6-litre petrol turbocharged petrol engine, available with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed DCT automatic. Kia also continues to offer a hybrid model, using the same 1.6-litre petrol engine but with electrical assistance that takes power up to 235bhp – a notable uplift compared to the 212bhp offered on the outgoing Sportage, though technical specifications are still to be confirmed. While not yet announced, we expect mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions to return to the line-up in time. The PHEV is likely to be tweaked compared to the current model with a larger battery and more competitive electric range than the 40 miles the outgoing model offers. Pricing of the updated Kia Sportage is expected to be announced in July, with a small increase expected over the current car’s £30,170 entry price. The same 2, 3, GT-Line and GT-Line S trim levels are expected to remain. The Kia Sportage continues to be one of the UK’s most popular cars, and year-to-date (until the end of April 2025), it is the second best-selling car, only behind the . We reckon this new model could end up topping the overall list when full production is up and running. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
118,Volvo reinvents the seatbelt,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/volvo-adaptive-seatbelt/,Jake Groves,2025-06-05,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo has reinvented the seatbelt. The Swedish brand that originally invented the safety belt in 1959 has given it another crack, designing a new ‘multi-adaptive safety belt’ that’s designed to respond and react better in the event of a crash. In short, the new seatbelt uses data and additional sensors to better adapt to the size and weight of the occupant, meaning it can provide a more measured load limit during a crash. Åsa Haglund, head of Volvo’s safety centre, says the new belt is ‘a great example of how we leverage real-time data with the ambition to help save millions of more lives.’ Volvo says the new belt ‘adapts the setting based on the situation and individual’s profiles, such as their height, weight, body shape and seating position.’ In other words, larger or heavier people need a higher belt load in an accident than a smaller or lighter occupant. Doing so, according to Volvo, can limit head injuries in larger occupants and rib fractures in smaller ones. The seatbelt also uses data that transmits during a crash, with Volvo saying while the crash is happening the seatbelt can apply the most appropriate level of tension to keep the occupants safe. The tech is also designed to learn, with Volvo promising that future over-the-air updates can make the system smarter. The first car we’ll see this in is , which Volvo confirms will officially launch in 2026. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

119,Honda gives Europe one last Civic Type R edition before it dies,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/honda/civic-type-r/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-05,Car Magazine UK,"Say goodbye, farewell and toodle-oo to the Civic Type R, as Honda is calling time on its ferocious and fabulous hot hatch in Europe. Just before the truly brilliant Type R departs, though, it’s creating one final version: the Ultimate Edition. The new Ultimate Edition is ‘designed to embody 28 years of hot hatch performance’, says Honda, with this version of the short-lived FL5-generation Civic Type R being adorned with cosmetic trinketry and a couple of sweet details. All 40 – yes… just FORTY – of the Ultimate Edition models are finished in Championship White and come with red stripe decals over the bonnet and down the sides. The roof is painted black and carbonfibre trimmings inside that even feature a red weave in it can be found. As well as Ultimate Edition badging, every one of the 40 owners will receive a gift box that contains a numbered plaque, carbonfibre key ring, bespoke floor mats and a car cover. The performance specs, meanwhile, remain the same. But that’s not a complaint – the combination of a 2.0-litre turbo making 325bhp and 310lb ft, driving the front wheels via a super sweet-shifting six-speed manual is hard to beat. That combination made the FL5 one of the best hot hatchbacks of recent times. We’ll miss it when it’s gone. Want to learn more about what you’ll be missing? Keep reading for our original report on the FL5 Type R. ‘With this generation, we tried to incorporate all the efficient and effective aerodynamic measures and wrapped them in an elegant shell,’ Kotaro Yamamoto, technical advisor of Honda Motor Europe tells CAR while pointing out the FL5’s uncluttered lines. Gone are the pronounced wheel arches of the previous gen, and with them the fake carbonfibre and cul-de-sac vents. Even the wheels are smaller this time around too (from 20-inches to 19-) though a ‘reverse-rim’ construction means you can hardly tell. The wider, more open, part of the alloy now faces outwards rather than inwards, giving the illusion of a bigger rim. At the rear, the new car sports a thoroughly re-designed wing. Smaller than the Star-Wars number slung on the back of the old car, it’s an intricate affair with die-cast aluminium supports. Alongside reducing weight, these trick struts take up less of the wing’s surface area – crucially leaving more of it to generate downforce. When combined with a Type R-specific hood, bumper, skirt and diffuser, downforce is up to 900nm at 124mph. Look further down and you’ll see a triple-pipe configuration similar to the old car, only here it’s reversed: two smaller pipes sit either side of a larger one, with all three nestled into a new diffuser. Every aspect has of the car has seen small but noticeable gains: the Brembo brakes return, though everything around them is different. ‘What we’ve changed significantly is the cooling,’ Yamamoto says, while showing us a new duct in the front wheel arch and a set of vents behind it. Both work in tandem to push cool air through the brakes and pull hot air out, improving their endurance in sustained use – and reducing drag. A reworked version of the turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder sits underneath the new Type R’s bonnet and benefits from a more compact turbo with stronger, lighter blades. ‘What has reduced is the inertia of the turbine itself. By reducing that weight, it is reacting much quicker and building up the boost pressure much, much quicker,’ Yamamoto explains. ‘That gives better response but also more airflow to improve the efficiency of the turbo. They can also pump more air into the cylinder. That is the key technology this time for the output increase.’ he adds. And what output increase? Yamamoto won’t budge and Honda won’t release the Civic’s new power figures until after homologation – but our passenger lap makes us think the 2023 Type R is knocking on Focus RS power. A 340bhp power figure and 5-second 0-62mph sprint aren’t out of the question – but unlike the fast Ford, power is driven entirely through the front axle. Honda’s dedication to two-wheel drive means this Civic Type R still feels particularly agile compared to its four-wheel-drive competition, though no official weight figures have been released. The new powertrain is mated to a manual six-speed ‘box, though this hasn’t been immune to tinkering either. Rev matching was a plus on the old car, but it’s again improved here, and is now both quicker and available through all gears. ‘The former Civic Type R wouldn’t do a rev match when shifting from second to first,’ Yamamoto reminds us. ‘But now it does.’ Honda has worked hard to improve the perceived quality of the new car, and it starts with the new seating position. ‘You’re sitting slightly lower than the previous generation. I think also the overall height of the car is lower,’ Yamamoto tells us, as we get comfortable behind the wheel. Directly ahead in the driver’s line of sight lies an arc of old-school LEDs, replacing the virtual TFT lights from the last Type R. They light up near the upper reaches of the rev range as you hone in on the redline. Like the previous gen, the new car also features a range of driver modes – but new for the FL5 is an Individual mode. Allowing the driver to swap and choose between suspension, powertrains, engine sound and other settings, it’s yet another step towards a more complete, more mature product. Featuring serious engineering and more palatable looks, Honda engineers believe this car has everything it needs to retain the hot-hatch crown, while appearing to a larger range of customers. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this feels like a car that costs upwards of the FK8’s £31k price tag. It’ll be released in Europe in 2023, though we’ll get firm facts and figures ideally later this year.

120,The Straßenversion is back! Porsche makes a street-legal 963 Le Mans hypercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/963-rsp/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-06,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Porsche 963 RSP, a one-off special of Stuttgart’s IMSA-and WEC-winning hypercar that’s been made road-legal. Revealed today at the Circuit de Sarthe ahead of the Le Mans endurance race next week – it’s also a throwback to the ‘Count Rossi’ 917. Known as Chassis 30 in Zuffenhausen, the ‘Count Rossi’ was a 917 that was driven from the factory to Paris by an owner that insisted it was adapted for the road as little as possible. It’s that silver racer that this 963 RSP is the spiritual successor to. As for the RSP part? That’s short for Roger S. Penske. The car was also the work of Porsche AG, Porsche Penske Motorsport and Porsche Cars North America. ‘That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,’ said Porsche works driver, Timo Bernhard, after driving the car for the first time on a public road. ‘The car behaved perfectly, it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 – I felt super special and a lot more comfortable especially as I want not needing all my safety gear.’ The Count Rossi’s changes were minimal, but a lot has happened in the 50 years since – and that means the 963 RSP is different beast to the Porsche hypercar you’ll see racing. It’s the first 963 car to be painted –  tricky given the patchwork of Kevlar and carbonfibre that makes up a modern racecar – and it’s been finished in a classic Martini Silver like the original car. Inside you get tan leather and Alcantara which is a little nicer than the real thing, and the bodywork has also been tweaked to further channel the 917. There are new front vents, period-accurate Michelin logos, forged OZ-racing wheels and an enamel Porsche logo. Blanking plates on the rear wing – required for the racing car – have been removed, too. Engine-wise, it keeps the same 4.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 as the racecar, and there’s no mention of any detuning. In the same way, the hybrid system and Xtrac ‘box appear untouched. It’s the Count Rossi way, after all. The skateboard-stiff suspension has also been changed, however; ride height has been increased and its Multimatic dampers have been calibrated to the softest possible level – so it’ll easier for the 963 to contend with the rougher roads and streets around Le Mans. A horn, numberplate and special Michelin tyres keep the gendarme away. You’ll be able to see this car on display during the Le Mans race week, but also at Goodwood later this year.

121,How Smart outgrew the city,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/smart/head-of-product-2025/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-09,Car Magazine UK,"Revealed earlier this year, the is the third model from the new-look Smart, and the furthest yet from the original city car that the brand was built on. Measuring 4695mm to the 2695mm, for example, it’s a D-segment bruiser that packs in power as well as tech. Executives say the #5’s efficient use of space means it’s a Smart through-and-through – and the market numbers also make a compelling case for it. But will Smart ever return to the segment it both supercharged and disrupted all those years ago? ‘I think the challenge for every OEM in the smaller segments is trying to understand feasibility, both in terms of technical feasibility and also the business case side of it as well Xuan-Zheng Goh, head of product management at Smart Europe explains to us at the #5 launch. Behind him are the bold, robust lines of the new #5 SUV. Smart says there are fewer consumers in the larger D-segment, but they’re willing to pay more – and therefore generate more profit. This is the first problem for city cars in 2025. ‘Smaller cars are harder to make money on,’ Goh tells me. ‘This is why we’ve seen a number of competitors or other mainstream players have slowly exited that segment.’ He’s right. The supermini market has essentially collapsed, with the end of the Fiesta in 2023 leaving a huge hole. ‘It’s no secret those things have added cost to any OEM who’s looking to develop any car,’ he continues. ‘Those type of costs are more easily absorbed in larger vehicles than they are smaller ones, because customers of smaller cars generally have less money to buy those vehicles.’ The other problem comes with the technology needed to power an all-electric city car – something unavoidable for Smart given its net-zero ethos: ‘The other side of it, which is always the case with any EV, is trying to find that optimum balance between battery size and range, because we know that the battery is one of the more expensive parts of the vehicle.’ That doesn’t mean we’re never going to see an electric city car – but it does make things significantly harder in the short-term. ‘We’ve been fairly open to say that we are exploring that area,’ Goh tells me. ‘But at the moment, we’ve got nothing official to say. ‘The market is there, and whoever can go in there, there’s a very good opportunity, definitely.’ I’d argue the just-released is making a good fist of being a city EV, though perhaps the margins and tech constraints aren’t quite right for Smart to dip in just yet. An EV-only brand could be seen as a gift or a curse – just look at the difference in fortunes between new-energy spin-offs Polestar and Cupra – but it’s no surprise Goh views Smart’s current BEV strategy as a plus: ‘The fact that we’ve said we’re 100% electric makes our brand and product proposition very clear that we that we have one strategy going forward for Europe,’ he reminds us. ‘We don’t have to manage some of the complexities that some of our competitors have to look at.’ And there are many, which are changing all the time. With smaller EVs on ice due to a mixture of market conditions, regulations and tech barriers (even with the might of Geely behind it) Smart is focusing on where the money is – and on a case-by-case basis at that. ‘We don’t see ourselves going any bigger than the current #5, because we know that the larger size markets certainly in Europe, are less popular,’ Goh explains. ‘I think we will look to fill in the gaps [in the model range] where we can, but we’ll assess it from a segment-by-segment perspective.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

122,Aston Martin reveals Valkyrie LM: Le Mans tech for ten lucky owners,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/valkyrie-lm/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-10,Car Magazine UK,"Aston Martin is the latest brand to reveal a new hypercar that promises to be the closest yet to its real-life Le Mans challenger. This time it’s called the Valkyrie LM, and just ten examples of the car will be made. WEC fans will know this isn’t the first time a brand has made a WEC spin-off; Aston’s project follows the one-off road-legal revealed last week, and the track car revealed in 2024. ‘Valkyrie LM is an exquisite opportunity to be part of the most exclusive Aston Martin owners club in the world,’ said Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark. ‘A group who can immerse themselves in the purest and most comparable endurance driving experience, one that would otherwise only be available to our works drivers operating at the very limit of sportscar racing’s highest echelon.’ Not much, or a lot – depending on the Valkyrie you’re thinking about. The Aston Martin Valkyrie is currently the only WEC hypercar based on a road-going model, but this car LM is based on the racing car, not the road car. That end, it keeps the same powertrain as the Le Mans racecar, which is ditches the hybrid system and makes far less than the post-1000bhp of the road car. With that in mind, the LM uses a lean-burn version of the 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 and tunes it to a regulation limited 670bhp. More than enough to be getting on with for privately-owned track car. The key differences between the LM and fully-blown racecar include the removal of ballast, FIA regulation electronics and the addition of more comfortable track-day focused cockpit interfaces. You still get a custom carbonfibre race seat, along with a six-point harness and fire suppression system. Torque sensors for managing power delivery have also been removed, and the V12 has been adapted to accepted more common fuel. Alongside a HANS device and full race kit, the Valkyrie LM also comes with a driver development program combined with track days put on by Aston Martin. The first year will be capped by a special evening at Aston’s Gaydon HQ. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

123,Apple CarPlay Ultra is finally here – and we’ve gone hands-on,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/apple-carplay-ultra/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-11,Car Magazine UK,"This is Apple CarPlay Ultra, the next logical step when it comes to smartphone and infotainment integration – and the closest we’re getting to an Apple Car this decade. It debuts in Aston Martin cars first and plugs Apple’s software into nearly every aspect of the car, spreading the iOS UI from the infotainment screen all the way to the cockpit dials. Does it work? Keep reading for our full review. CarPlay Ultra is bolted onto the existing system, but reaches further into the car, giving you access to things like ESC, climate control and the radio among other bits. But it also changes the look and feel of other parts of the car, such as the speedometer and tachometer dials. Unlike Google’s HMI as seen in the Polestar 4 for instance, which runs natively at all times, Apple CarPlay Ultra will require an Apple smartphone to work and is best thought of a more encompassing version of the existing CarPlay system. To that end, you’ll need an iPhone 12 or newer, running at least iOS 18.54. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll continue to be able to use Android Auto, or Aston’s baked-in next-gen infotainment software. Installing takes a few minutes on the first occasion, though it’s quicker when carried out over a wired connection. After that, Ultra will boot up as soon as you get in the car. On the surface, much like the system we’ve become used to over the years. Most of the icons are carried over from the basic CarPlay setup but look closer and you’ll see a few subtle additions. Cabin temperature is now displayed long with ‘zones’ as you’re able to change it via CarPlay, but there are new icons that hint at Ultra’s extended functionality. Climate, Radio and Vehicle icons now appear along with a Settings icon we’ll get to later. Climate works pretty much how you’d expect, with zones adjusted via an onscreen slider. Radio functionality means you can switch stations within the CarPlay environment, without having to dip into the car’s native infotainment instead. Finally, the vehicle control area allows you to control things like Drive Modes, Hill Descent control and the DBX’s Bowers & Wilkins sound system. Importantly, this functionality is 1:1 with the switchgear in the cabin; change the volume or climate control via a physical control, and it’ll be shown on CarPlay Ultra. Everything works how you expect with very little, fuss – and Siri works across the whole thing like a relatively accurate puppet master. It doesn’t feel like a step change though – more like how things should have been from the very beginning. The biggest visual changes come with the new CarPlay-powered cockpit dials. Customisable to the degree you’d expect of a Cupertino product, there are a range of layouts available: you start with a traditional-looking Aston Martin default, but swipe further and things get techier. Check out the bar-focused, layout below, for example, which looks more like an iPad app than something to measure revs or speed. You can choose the colour-scheme and background for each of them, but it’s interesting how the Aston Martin layout manages to fuse the design style of Gaydon with that of Apple. Take a look at the pictures here, and you’ll find it sympathetic to the design of the rest of the cabin – whilst still having a hint of California. Let’s see how successful other car makers will be. In practice, using the cockpit dials are no different to using the default ones, though you could say it’s less-mentally taxing when glancing between the two. Apple CarPlay Ultra feels like a huge thing on the surface, but ultimately, it’s just a logical upgrade to what’s come before. It’s a technological step change but subtle in practice, removing barriers and obstacles that shouldn’t really have existed in the first place. It’s so sensible that on the rare occasion you must switch back to the car’s native UI (when changing ambient lightning for example) it feels terrible. Like the best technology then, CarPlay Ultra is groundbreaking for around five minutes before melting into everyday use. The most interesting thing to me? How Aston Martin and other car brands will maintain their look, feel and identity when partnering up with a tech and design giant like Apple. As I write this, Apple has revealed its most dramatic UI change in years: a new ‘Liquid Glass’ interface to be introduced on all Apple devices as well as CarPlay. How its futuristic look will work with Ultra’s tightrope between car and tech device remains to be seen. Over the last few years, lines have been quietly drawn while partnerships have been publicly signed. With the onset of EVs and their rather analogous powertrains, many car brands have looked to preserve as many touchpoints with the consumer as they can – including an infotainment OS. How will the likes of Aston and Porsche work with Apple in the future, and how will they preserve their brand identity with it? It’ll be an interesting few years. Aston Martin says it’ll come as standard on all new orders in the USA and Canada from today and will be available as an update for cars that use Gaydon’s next-gen infotainment system. It’ll expand to other markets in the next 12 months. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

144,Lotus reassures UK government over Hethel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lotus/hethel-factory/,Keith Adams,2025-07-01,Car Magazine UK,"Lotus has told the UK government it has no plans to shut its Hethel factory, after rising speculation the sports car maker could shift production to the US to sidestep tariffs, improve localisation, and cut costs. The urgent reassurance comes as Britain’s car industry reels from its worst May production figures since 1949, highlighting just how precarious the landscape has become for niche performance brands. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met Lotus and Chinese owner Geely Holding on Sunday after reports that the Emira sports car could be built in the USA rather than Norfolk. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said Reynolds had been ‘reassured by management that they are committed to their UK operations and have no plans to close their Hethel plant.’ However, Geely has confirmed it’s exploring American manufacturing. Qingfeng Feng, CEO of Lotus Technology, told investors the company was looking at ‘localisation plans’ in the US to avoid tariffs, describing it as ‘a feasible plan’. Lotus paused production at Hethel in mid-May to manage inventory and cope with supply chain disruption triggered by the US’s extra 25% import tariffs. The Norfolk factory can build up to 5000 Emiras a year, around 60% of which are shipped to America. It also produces the £2.3m Evija electric hypercar in small numbers. Meanwhile, Lotus’s electric Eletre SUV and Emeya saloon are built in China. The uncertainty surrounding Hethel comes as the broader UK car industry struggles to keep pace. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show UK car production plunged nearly a third in May to just 49,810 units, the lowest May total for 76 years outside of the 2020 pandemic. Exports to the US halved after new tariffs hit earlier this year, though a UK-US trade deal taking effect this month will drop those duties to 10% on up to 100,000 vehicles annually. Christopher Sawyer, former communications director for Lotus Cars USA Inc, said that Geely may be overestimating Lotus’s brand firepower. ‘Geely Holding has acted as though Lotus is the modern equivalent of Porsche or Ferrari. It’s not. Lotus is a past-tense car company while there are present or even future-tense concerns,’ he told . ‘Add in the geopolitical nonsense of mandating EVs and you have a recipe for disaster. The Emira is a wonderful vehicle, but the pricing is ridiculous and the branding non-existent.’ Ben Goldsborough, Labour MP for South Norfolk, said he remains ‘deeply concerned’ about Hethel’s future, describing the plant as vital to local jobs and British automotive heritage. For now, Lotus insists normal operations continue and that the UK remains ‘the heart of the Lotus brand’. But with US tariffs easing and Geely weighing its options, the question hanging over Hethel is how long the historic factory can remain at the centre of Lotus’s global plans.

While the rest of us have to wait to the end of the month to get our ghoul on, Rolls-Royce has just unveiled the facelifted version of its junior limo/GT, the Ghost, which was new in 2020. Like the , the Series II version of the £300k-ish Ghost keeps the fundamentals largely unchanged but makes a few small but significant design changes, and brings a major – but largely invisible – tech upgrade. And as with the Cullinan, the will be available straight away, Black Badge being the slightly more powerful version with slightly more black trim. The four-door body is still all-aluminum, the air suspension is still adaptive, the 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12 still drives all four wheels and there’s still all-wheel steering. There’s now an extra emphasis from Rolls-Royce on getting customers involved early on in the details of the car’s specification and finish, with a huge variety of choices for paintwork and interior lightshows, and options such as champagne coolers. CAR has been privy to that whole experience once before, . Rolls-Royce has recently been granted planning permission for an extension of its plant at Goodwood, which will make room for a new paintshop and other facilities for personalising your Roller… for a price. With so much of the Ghost unchanged, best to just highlight some of the changes. The Rolls-Royce approach to innovation often involves leaning into its traditions. So with the Ghost Series II, the biggest visible change is to the Pantheon grille. ‘Change’ is relative when it comes to that grille, which has been used on Rolls-Royce cars in subtly evolving forms for more than a century, having been originally inspired by ancient Rome. On the Ghost the grille is illuminated, and framed by new headlights and daytime running lights, and there are new chrome embellishments that from some angles give the illusion that the Spirit of Exstasy figure is floating. The Black Badge (the white car in our photos) gets its own style of air intake, with black chrome frames, and the grille itself is darker. The tail lights, derived from those on the electric Spectre, tidy up the Ghost’s back end. There are two main light panels in each unit, linked by a new decorative chrome element, or black chrome in the case of the Black Badge. They’re now very different from the Phantom’s more blocky rear lights, which don’t curl around the side of the car so much. There’s a choice of 22-inch wheel styles, both with nine spokes. One is fully polished, the other part-polished. On the Black Badge there are seven-spoke, part-polished, 22-inch wheels, giving a better view of the huge brakes. A glass panel spans the whole dash, from pillar to pillar, with the ‘Spirit’ operating system focused on the central touchscreen. It’s a system adapted from BMW’s iDrive, and is much more modern than it looks if what you first notice is the strong attachment to physical knobs and switches throughout the cabin. Passengers in the back can now connect up to two streaming devices. The rear screens host a new interface that lets passengers manage functions including massaging and cooling. There’s also a new 1400-watt amplifier feeding the 18-speaker audio set-up, with the otpion of making the headliner part of the sound system. Like the Cullinan, the Ghost now also has an elaborately illuminated Spirit of Ecstasy clock cabinet in the dash; black chrome is used for the figurine in the Black Badge. Huge choices for interior finish now include the option of non-leather upholstery. Duality Twill, a bamboo-based fabric, debuted in the Cullinan. It’s available in a modest-sounding three colours –  but with a choice of 51 different colours for the thread.

124,GR LH2 Concept: Toyota doubles down on hydrogen at Le Mans,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/gr-lh2-concept/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-11,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota hasn’t forgotten about hydrogen power, and neither has Le Mans. To remind us of the ‘other’ powertrain type, Toyota Gazoo Racing has revealed an all-new liquid hydrogen racecar ahead of Le Mans race week. Called the GR LH2 Racing Concept, it follows previous hydrogen concepts from Toyota and will once again double up as a testbed for hydrogen technology in motorsports. Toyota isn’t just about concepts though; it already races in the Japanese Super Taikyu series with a hydrogen-engined Corolla which is arguably more significant but less cool than the concept you see above. The Corolla made its debut in 2021 using gaseous hydrogen, but it’s since moved to liquid hydrogen since 2023. Toyota has also applied the hydrogen powertrain to its rally program, with a GR Yaris H2 completing a demo in the Ypres Rally in 2022. It’s fair to say hydrogen’s popularity pales in companion to that of EVs, but it’s still being championed by brands such as BMW and Toyota – but also the Le Mans 24h race itself. The race often showcases demonstrations or hydrogen-powered concepts – and this year looks to be no different. It should all serve as a run-up to a hydrogen-powered class that aims to debut at Le Mans in 2027. We say ‘aims’ because both the ACO and FIA (organisations that run the WEC together) originally planned to create a hydrogen-powered class to race in 2024 – though that deadline continues to slip.

125,BYD's Dolphin Surf: yours for under £19k in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/byd/dolphin-surf/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-06-11,Car Magazine UK,"The segment is probably the most important corner of the new car market to conquer. Manufacturers are still grappling at the intersection between profitability and affordability – but whichever car maker can figure out how to win in this space first will own it for years before its rivals can catch up. And the BYD Dolphin Surf is shaping up to be a pretty serious player. BYD has released more specs about its pint-sized urban hero – and they’re a long way ahead of other small EVs such as the and . Try these on for size: a base price of £18,650, with the top-spec car featuring a 43.2kWh battery pack, a maximum range of almost 200 miles and a price tag of £23,950. But it gets better the further down the range you descend. Step into to a more basic version of the Surf, with a smaller battery pack and less powerful electric motor, and you’ll can get the price down to just £16,000, making it ideally positioned to combat the £14,995 Spring and £15,995 T03. What’s more, the Surf offers a lot more cabin technology and it promises to be safer in an accident. The cheapest Active model costs £18,650. It has a 30kWh battery pack and an 87bhp electric motor, which BYD says is enough for a maximum range of 136 miles and a 0–62mph time of 11.1 seconds. These performance stats are far better than both versions of the Dacia Spring (the cheapest one takes 19.1 seconds to get to 62mph), while range is comparable. Step up a rung to the BYD Dolphin Surf Boost and you’ll unlock the brand’s larger 43.2kWh battery which increases the maximum range to 200 miles. The Boost still gets the same motor as the Active though, which means 0–62mph takes 12.1 seconds due the extra weight of the battery. Prices for this variant start from £21,950. The top-spec Comfort model features the same battery as the Boost, but it’s powering a punchier 154bhp electric motor – which BYD proudly states is the most powerful electric motor in the segment. Indeed, it has more than three times the power of the cheapest Spring, meaning it can shunt the Surf from 0–62mph in 9.1 seconds. Range doesn’t take a huge hit, either. The car’s official WLTP figure is 193 miles. Yours for £23,950. Charge times are identical across the range, as BYD increased the speed at which the bigger battery can accept electricity. Every version of the Dolphin Surf takes 30 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent capacity using a DC rapid charger, while a full charge using a slower 11kW wallbox takes three and half hours for the base model or five hours for the Boost and Comfort variants. Standard equipment includes rear parking sensors, a rear-view camera, air conditioning, keyless entry, electrically adjustable side mirrors and a 10.1-inch infotainment system which, because this is BYD, can rotate between portrait and landscape at the touch of a button. Oh yeah, and that lairy green paint finish is the standard colour. Boost models get 16-inch alloy wheels, electrically adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers and electrically folding door mirrors. The top-spec Comfort variant gains LED headlights, rear privacy glass, heated front seats, a wireless smartphone charger, tinted rear windows and exterior downlights under the door mirrors. Every version of the Dolphin Surf also features a natty vehicle-to-load (V2L) system that allows you to use the energy in the car’s battery to power external appliances such as power tools, laptops, coffee machines or compact electric grills. We don’t know for certain yet as still hasn’t batted the car around its test facility. But BYD seems confident the Surf will get a good result, as it has plenty of high-strength steel in its body 68.2% (compared to 60% in the Leapmotor T03) and it sports the firm’s puncture-resistant Blade Battery technology, which greatly lowers the risk of the car catching fire if you manage to rattle its underside over a kerb at 70mph. In addition to this passive safety, you get a lot of standard active safety technology, including lane-keeping assist, automatic emergency braking, intelligent adaptive cruise control and an emergency call function. We can even spy a driver monitoring camera in BYD’s press images. To frame that list with some context, that’s basically all the tech Euro NCAP berated Dacia for leaving off the Spring. Well, BYD isn’t going anywhere any time soon. The brand’s executive vice president, Stella Li (below), is dead set on knocking established European OEMs off their perches. She said: ‘Our Q1 sales in 2025 will be bigger than the whole of last year in the UK.’ She then added: ‘BYD will offer 13 models in Europe within 18 months.’ Today, if you include the Dolphin Surf, BYD sells ten models in Europe – and they’ve all sprung onto the scene within the last two years. This aggressive product expansion will be joined by fierce growth in the UK dealer network, as the car maker intends to swell its retail footprint from 62 to 120 outlets by the end of 2025. Proof, were it needed, that BYD is the Chinese car brand to watch. Where others are happy to about rampant expansion plans, it’s actually the walk and delivering real growth.

126,Caterham reveals last Seven powered by Ford's Sigma engine,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/caterham/310-encore/,Jake Groves,2025-06-12,Car Magazine UK,"Caterham Cars is saying goodbye to the Ford Sigma engine with a new edition: the 310 Encore. The new model will be limited to just 25 units, and will set those very few new owners back £39,995. Encore cars use the most powerful version of the Sigma engine, which develops 152bhp, revs to 7000rpm and is linked to a five speed manual. The 310 Encore can sprint to 60mph in 4.9sec and onto a top speed of 127mph, and Caterham says that amount of shove is good for a 281bhp per tonne power-to-weight figure. As well as bold colours and retro graphics, the 310 Encore also comes with the same nose as the 620 version, carbonfibre front wheelarches and a black accent pack. Harnesses, a gearshift light and a removable Momo steering wheel feature inside – as does a numbered plaque for each of the 25 cars made. Caterham Cars CEO, Bob Laishley, says: ‘the Seven 310 Encore really is a proper tribute to this long-lasting and unique association. Perfectly designed for road and track, it distils all the successes of the last half century into a unique vehicle that truly acts as a fitting celebration of the Ford Sigma’s indelible mark on Caterham history.’ The news comes not long after Caterham confirmed its Academy racers would switch to a 1.3-litre engine powered by Horse Technologies – a joint-venture between Geely, Renault and Aramco that aims to ‘develop the next generation of hybrid and combustion engines.’ Ford Sigma engines had also powered the Academy cars since 2008, and would make the switch to Horse engines for the 2026 Academy year. Beyond that, it would make sense for Caterham Cars to investigate using Horse engines for its future production cars.

127,McLaren's next decade looks... powerful,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mclaren/next-decade/,Ben Miller,2025-06-13,Car Magazine UK,"Until the McLaren W1, being a test driver was perhaps the best job in the world, just ahead of X-Wing pilot: sit in a few meetings, nod a bit, spend all day on the ragged edge, home in time for an ice bath and a calming re-ordering of your sock drawer. It’s suddenly a far less tempting career, though, and for that we can blame the McLaren W1. Fancy not merely driving the 1258bhp, 988lb ft supercar (small fry in this world of Pininfarina Battistas and Bugatti Chirons, but you’ll recall the Woking car is exclusively rear-wheel drive) but spanking it sufficiently hard, on the regular, that your tepid telemetry doesn’t get you sacked and you’re able to proffer meaningful feedback? Me either. The new MHP-8 engine – the internal-combustion element of the W1’s hybrid powertrain – will, McLaren hopes, punch the W1 into the public consciousness in the same way the P1 did all those years ago. And it will – in various states of tune and as part of Woking’s new-generation modular hybrid toolkit – power a new generation of McLarens, including the replacement for the 720S/750S. ‘A considerable amount of work and investment has gone into developing this new powertrain,’ explains a McLaren spokesperson. ‘We are introducing it on the W1, but we would not be investing in this engine for just 399 cars. This high-performance hybrid V8 will power the next generation of McLaren supercars.’ In development for four years, it doesn’t arrive with any headline gimmicks but instead tantalisingly blurs the line between production road engineering and high-performance motorsport technologies. It then squeezes those ideas harder that might be thought possible and, just when you thought it quite powerful enough (the 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, with a flat-plane crank and all-aluminium architecture, the engine alone is good for 915bhp and 664lb ft on its own), teams it with a battery and e-motor so potent and yet so hushed you can, if you listen hard enough, hear McLaren’s test drivers wincing. Part of their problem’s going to be the remorselessness of the violence. McLaren talks of ‘expanding the performance envelope’, and it’s not kidding – the new engine makes more torque than the most powerful version of the previous unit everywhere, and by a hefty 30 per cent margin. But it’ll also rev to 9200rpm (the Lamborghini Temerario’s V8, with its hot-in-vee architecture, spins faster but makes less power and torque than the McLaren unit, with its outboard turbos) thanks to ruthless programme of component lightweighting, including hollow valves and camshafts. And then there’s the hybrid system. It can throw another 342bhp and 325lb ft into the mix, spinning at up to 24,000rpm and delivering a comparable specific output (23bhp per kg; the motor weighs just 15kg) as an F1 e-motor), McLaren claims. And that’s because it’s cut from comparable cloth, being derived from the motor used in IndyCar. Shuffle the W1 into the right mode, get clear of any built-up areas and we’re talking 0-124mph in 5.8sec, 0-186mph in under 12.7 seconds and a top speed limited to 217mph, together with a soundtrack to banish forever the sometimes lacklustre vocals of McLaren’s previous V8, plus so much torque you’ll be able to rotate the thing mid-corner with the merest tensioning of your right ankle. And if you were hoping you might get break once you’ve exhausted the very modest 1.3kWh battery, no dice. Of the two Race modes, GP (which offers consistent electrical power over the course of a tank of fuel) does reduce overall performance very slightly when compared with Sprint, but not so as you’d notice. ‘In a 0-186mph sprint, we’ve still got 50% of the battery left by the time we get to 186mph,’ explains powertrain chief engineer Richard Jackson. ‘We can get to that 217mph top speed and maintain it without full EV support – you will get there and still have surplus power available. And of course, the moment you lift you’re regenerating again…’ Truly there’s no rest for the wicked. As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy.

128,The Peugeot GTi returns! New E-208 GTi launches at Le Mans,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/peugeot/e-208-gti/,Jake Groves,2025-06-13,Car Magazine UK,"Peugeot’s GTi name makes a valiant return after years of being dormant. This is the new E-208 GTi, the first new high-performance model launched by Peugeot since its days. And, given the brand’s propensity for hot hatchbacks over the last 40 years, we’re pleased to see the GTi name return to something that isn’t a crossover or SUV. Hurrah for some high-performance common sense. What is completely different, though, is how this GTi is powered – it’s electric. The new E-208 GTi, unsurprisingly, follows the same sort of recipe used by the and . Given it’s on the same platform as those two crossovers, it wouldn’t have taken much for Peugeot to shape it up into a GTi car. Performance, then, will be familiar if you’ve been paying attention to your Stellantis performance cars. The new E-208 GTi includes a 276bhp electric motor driving the front wheels, good for a 5.7sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 112mph. The 54kWh battery pack remains the same as , meaning a WLTP range claim of 217 miles. It’s not just about power, though, as the new E-208 GTi comes with a limited-slip differential and a sports suspension setup ‘with specific hydraulic stops’ that drops the ride height by 30mm. Engineers have also widened the car’s track – 56mm at the front and 27mm at the rear – for a better stance. Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres are wrapped around those, er… new 18-inch wheels. They’re designed to be a bit of a throwback to the pepperpot-style alloys seen on the 205 GTi 1.9, and Peugeot claims they help with brake cooling. Other visual details include beefier wheelarches, flashes of red in the headlights and grille and a fat rear spoiler. Inside, there are more red details on the i-Cockpit steering wheel, while thickly-bolstered new performance seats come with GTi branding and some retro stitching. A price and launch date haven’t been revealed yet, but the new GTi will likely be on sale before the end of 2025. Stay tuned.

130,"Audi’s new Q3 has an angry face, hybrid pace and weird indicators",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q3-suv/,Jake Groves,2025-06-17,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has revealed its latest Q3 model, launching it with a plug-in hybrid that can go the distance. This latest-generation of Q3 aims to keep up the sales momentum, and inject some new tech into the mix. The new Q3 will be built at – alongside the A3. Predictable, right? Frowny face, big ‘mouth’ via its large Singleframe grille, shallow headlights and some purposeful creases in deliberate places. The new Q3 follows the design ethos of larger cars like the A5, Q5 and Q6 e-Tron, but in a smaller package. Naturally, because this is Audi, the Q3 can be had with customisable digital LED lighting that use micro-LEDs for animated effects,. New colours and wheel designs feature, too, with the S-line models benefitting from silver details. Audi is keen to improve refinement in its small family SUV, saying that this the first of its small cars to get acoustic glass in the front and side windows to reduce wind and road noise for those inside. A lot of the same tech seen on the , and – which, from experience, isn’t great. The dashboard is dominated by the large ‘digital stage’ display that incorporates a big central screen running a fast infotainment system and some clean digital instruments. There’s a lot of gloss black trim (ugh…) and haptic buttons on the steering wheel ( ugh…), as well as colourful ambient lighting. You can spec a Sonos sound system as part of the Sound and Vision pack, too. A new feature, though, is the ‘steering wheel control unit.’ It’s a single stalk that combines the indicators and wipers into one on the left side of the steering column. The stalk itself doesn’t move, though; instead, the end of it tilts to activate the indicators, while other switches are used to operate the wipers. This also means the drive shifter has moved to the right-hand side of the steering column, saving space in the centre console. At launch, your options are a 147bhp or 261bhp all-wheel drive petrol engine, with the former benefitting from Audi’s MHEV Plus technology. A 147bhp diesel and a plug-in hybrid badged as an e-hybrid model will also be available. The 268bhp e-hybrid model features a 25.7kWh battery pack, allowing for a possible 74 miles of electric range. The battery pack can be charged via a 50kW DC charger, too. In a year’s time, Audi says it will add a 201bhp petrol all-wheel drive model to the line-up. As for other engineering details, Audi says it has improved the car’s suspension system and offers different ones depending on spec. Standard cars get standard steel springs; top-shelf Edition 1 versions feature lowered and firmer sports suspension, while a system with twin-valve dampers (like you get on a Porsche Macan) is offered as an option. Audi UK has confirmed the new Q3 will be available to order in July 2025, priced from £38,300 for a TFSI petrol model; £40,000 for a TDI diesel model and £45,800 for the e-hybrid PHEV.

131,Nissan Leaf Mk3 revealed: can it stand out in the crowded market it created?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/leaf/,Jake Groves,2025-06-17,Car Magazine UK,"Just weeks after taking the wraps off the new electric-only Renault 5-inspired new Micra, Nissan has revealed the Mk3 Leaf, which will be built in Sunderland and goes on sale next year. It will soon be one of five electric cars in the Nissan line-up, as well as an evolving range of hybrids. The Ariya, Leaf and Micra will be joined by a new electric-only Juke next year, then a smaller EV too. It’s quite a contrast to when the first Leaf arrived 15 years ago, and almost single-handedly established the mainstream compact family EV as a viable choice for eco-minded buyers. Over two generations it sold 290,000 in Europe and 700,000 worldwide. The new car sits on a version of the CMF-EV platform used in the larger Ariya. The new Leaf’s overall length is 14cm shorter than the previous Leaf, and it’s slightly taller and wider. The aerodynamically sleek five-door body features a ‘wheel at each corner’ look that helps increase boot and cabin space. The boot capacity is now 437 litres, and it has an underfloor compartment for the first time. Also contributing to the space-efficiency of the layout is a compact new heating/ventilation unit, which moves forward out of the cabin. The single electric motor, at the rear of the car, is also more compact than before. It will be available with a choice of battery sizes, 52kWh (Standard) and 75kWh (Extended), the larger one giving up to 375 miles of range and efficiency of 4.4 miles per kWh. With charging capability up to 150kW, and what Nissan claims is a near-flat charging curve, it can gain up to 260 miles in 30 minutes. The small-battery version has a WLTP range of 270 miles, and makes 174bhp and 254lb ft of torque, with a top speed of 99mph and 0-62mph time of 8.6sec. The big-battery Leaf trumps it with 215bhp, 262lb ft and 62mph in 7.6sec (but the same top speed). Nissan claims that in its own tests at the Millbrook proving ground in Bedfordshire the Extended version could circulate at 80mph for 205 miles, while the Standard model reached 270 miles. A lot of attention during the creation of the Mk3 was put into aerodynamics (including an automatically closing and opening grille) and thermal management (so the heating and cooling of battery, cabin air, seat and steering wheel is fully integrated and ultra efficient). The front door handles are flush, automatically emerging when you approach the car, while the underbody is sealed, contributing to the drag coefficient of 0.25. There are four trim levels: basic Engage, available only with the smaller battery, is strictly for fleets and commuters; higher levels bring Google nav and infotainment, a head-up display, and two 14.3-inch screens. One 19-inch and two 18-inch wheel designs are available. A dimmable glass roof is available, as is high-end Bose audio, which includes a speaker in the driver’s head restraint, allowing them to hear nav instructions and incoming phone calls without disturbing the other occupants, who can carry on listening to their choice of entertainment from the Google apps. Vehicle-to-load charging capability is available from the off, and vehicle-to-grid will follow. Giovanny Arroba, Nissan Design Europe vice president, told us the design was intended to combine efficiency and practicality with an embrace of Japanese style and a dose of Nissan DNA. ‘We did a lot of soul searching: what is Nissan? It’s not just performance. We’re also adventure, we’re also charm, and balance. We tend to pioneer these cars that have a lot of character, and they become almost a brand themselves – Qashqai, Juke, GT-R, Z. What is Nissan, what is the DNA? Hopefully you’ll see that reflected in cars like this and the Micra.’ He’s also very pleased with the new recurring motif, representing a two (Ni in Japanese) and a three (San). It started with the rear lights, which have an eye-catching combination of two horizontal lines and three vertical, but it also appears on the charger flap and elsewhere. ‘It’s very easy to do a horizontal light bar. I like it – it’s cool – but we wanted to do something more memorable. That’s where the two-three came from. We wanted to make the brand more appealing, more lifestyle-oriented, not just a commodity for mobility, but a desirable Japanese-themed design product. ‘We try to see through the customer’s eyes. But as designers we also have to trust our intuition.

132,Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X: the hypercar haranguer,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/chevrolet/corvette-zr1x/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2025-06-17,Car Magazine UK,"Not content with chasing European sports and supercars, the ZR1X is going after the hypercar elite. Not content with offering over 1,000bhp in the twin-turbo ZR1, the ZR1X adds the hybrid system from the E-Ray for some truly bonkers numbers. How does 1,250bhp of total system output, nearly 1,000Ib ft of torque and a sub-2.0 second 0-62mph sound? Should you like to live life a quarter mile at a time, its expected to drop below 9.0 seconds for that metric with a peak speed of 150mph. How does it make the Ferrari SF90 and Lamborghini Revuelto look positively malnourished? It starts with a 5.5-litre flat-plane crank V8 with double overhead camshafts and a pair of 76mm turbos. That means no lazy responses here, with the engine alone producing 1,064bhp at 7,000rpm and 828 Ib ft of torque at a heady 6,000rpm. Up front is an uprated version of the E-Ray’s electric motor with 186bhp and 145Ib ft all on its own that operates at up to 160mph and drives the front wheels. Combined with some trick anti-lag tech on the V8, it should mean a responsive throttle pedal regardless of speed and revs. The battery is a tiddly 1.9kWh and can’t be charged from the mains. Two chassis configurations are available, a road-biased standard chassis on Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber, or the ZTK Performance Package that brings stiffer spring (and presumably damper) rates. ZTK cars get a lairy aero kit as standard that produces 544kg of downforce at top speed. Like other 2026 ‘Vettes, the interior gets a tickle and finally ditches the thin row of buttons on the driver/passenger separator. That said, I still see electric window controls that wouldn’t look out of place on a worn-smooth Florida rental-spec Malibu.

133,How Alpine hopes to shatter the laws of physics with torque,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/alpine-torque-vectoring/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-06-20,Car Magazine UK,"Alpine has built its brand on two pillars – lightweight engineering and nimble handling. But the company might be forced to take a sledgehammer to those pillars because they aren’t yet compatible with electric cars. Automotive engineers haven’t yet worked out how to strip enough weight out of an electric car’s battery pack to make it handle as keenly as an equivalent petrol car maintain a convenient maximum driving range. But Alpine seems to think it can engineer its way around the problem with some clever torque-vectoring tech and chassis tuning designed to hide the weight of its new electric cars. These physics-defying silver bullets were introduced on the 2.1-tonne and they’ll also feature on the upcoming . Scroll down to find out how it all works. The Alpine A390 is based on the Renault Group’s AmpR Medium platform (the same as the ), albeit with several improvements. Instead of a single electric motor up front, it has three – one for the front wheels and two at the rear. The rear motors can spin independently of one another. Effectively, that means Alpine can use them to steer the car from the rear using torque. So, when you pitch the A390 into a corner, the outside wheel spins faster than the inside one, pushing the rear of the car around the bend like a skid-steer. As the video below shows. But it gets cleverer than that, because all three motors are receiving a constant stream of information from the car’s steering rack and traction control system. The motors can adjust the torque split both front to rear and left to right depending on the amount of understeer or oversteer the car is experiencing. I’ll break it down. You’ve approached a corner at Mach 4. You’ve left it far too late to brake and you’ve overwhelmed the front tyres. You’re starting to understeer. The car’s computer senses your impending calamity and feeds power to the outside rear wheel to kick the arse of the car out and correct your mistake. Once it’s gathered it up, it’ll send power to all four wheels equally to catapult you down the next straight. The inverse is also true. Say you’ve pushed too much weight onto the nose of the car on your way into a corner with heavy braking and the rear end is starting to step out of line. The computers will back the power off the rear outside wheel, send a dab of power to the rear inside wheel to stop the car rotating further and use the front motor to get the car tracking straight again. Alpine claims the speed at which this torque vectoring technology can adjust the balance of the chassis mid-corner will make the A390 ‘feel’ lighter than it is by masking its inertia and tricking your brain into thinking the car is more playful than its weight would suggest. The trickery doesn’t end there. Alpine’s engineers fitted the A390 with fast steering (which it reckons further helps to hide the car’s bulk), unique adaptive dampers and clever hydraulic bumps stops that were designed to better slow your descent when you drop the car into dip on the road. A big compression over a dip (followed by a clatter into the bump stops) is a key part of what makes a large EV feel heavy, simply because well-maintained petrol cars don’t exhibit that behaviour. It’s unfamiliar. Petrol cars tend to weigh less and so they accelerate more slowly into the ground over undulating surfaces. By slowing that descent at the extremities of the car’s suspension travel with what’s effectively a second damper, Alpine hopes the A390 will feel more like a 1.6 or 1.8-tonne car rather than 2.1-tonne car. Think of it like a bungee jump – when you reach the end of your travel, the elastic goes taught and you’re hauled up gently rather than hitting the earth below with a crunch. Not only should that prevent the chassis from become unsettled when it reaches the limit of its travel, it should also maintain ride comfort. No other manufacturer has nailed this balance yet – not even the class leaders. Hyundai, for example, could have improved the way the Ioniq 5 N controls the heft of its battery with some cast-iron dampers, but they would have made the car untenably uncomfortable on your morning commute. I’m certainly looking forward to trying Alpine’s chassis tech for myself. I’ll report back once I’ve got some first-hand experience to tell you whether it’s worked.

134,Volkswagen Golf GTI Edition 50 marks half a century of this brilliant hot hatch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/golf-gti-edition-50/,Ted Welford,2025-06-20,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has marked 50 years of its legendary with the reveal of the Golf GTI Edition 50 at the Nurburgring 24 hour race. The latest in a long line of celebratory GTI special editions every five years, VW will begin production of its most powerful GTI ever later this year to make sure that customers get their cars in early 2026 – 50 years after the original Golf GTI debuted as a skunkworks project. Half a century later, more than 2.5 million have been produced across eight generations. Here’s everything you need to know about the Edition 50. The Edition 50 is based on the , using the 2.0-litre EA888 engine, but now gets power levels closer to that of the . Compared to the Clubsport’s 297bhp and 295lb ft of torque, the Edition 50 puts out 321bhp and 310lb ft. There’s no word on performance figures, but expect a 0-62mph figure of around five seconds and a top speed capable of 166mph with the optional GTI Performance package. As with every , there’s no manual gearbox, a seven-speed DSG is used instead. It’s not a coincidence that VW decided to reveal the Edition 50 at the Nurburgring 24-hour race, as it’s the quickest production Golf to have ever gone around the Green Hell. Lapping the Nordschleife in a time of 07:46:13 minutes with racing driver Benjamin Leuchter at the wheel, it’s three seconds faster around than the Clubsport S. After his drive, Leuchter said: ‘It reminds me a lot of the Golf GTI Clubsport S from 2016. However, the Golf GTI Edition 50 has been systematically enhanced once again. Because it’s so intuitive and precise, I have a lot of confidence in the car and can really push it to the limit.” The Edition 50 isn’t just about more power, though, with VW tuning its DCC adaptive dampers, adjusting the front differential lock and tuning the steering. An optional ‘GTI Performance’ package is also available, with lowered suspension and higher spring rates. You also get Bridgestone Potenza Race semi-slicks, which are said to be a ‘brand-new’ development, and are 1.1kg lighter than regular rubber. An Akrapovic exhaust system is also available, saving a further 11kg. You do indeed, and VW has well and truly run with the red GTI theme. There are red seatbelts, upgraded sports seats in the classic check pattern and a redesigned sports steering wheel with a GTI 50 logo. Even red pedals! Two new colours are also available exclusively on the GTI 50 – Dark Moss green and Tornado Red, the latter synonymous with GTIs across the years. There are various logos dotted across the car, too, including on the spoiler and insides of the exterior mirrors. They also come with a black roof and door mirrors, with a black-finished exhaust system There’s no word on production numbers, but as with most previous anniversary models, we expect production numbers to be capped, albeit not to the rarity levels of the , of which just 400 were produced. Expect a healthy premium over a GTI Clubsport’s £43,215 starting price, though VW says it hopes that cars ‘can be delivered to customers promptly for the start of its anniversary year in the first quarter of 2026’. VW has produced a special edition version of its Golf GTI every five years since the ‘20 years of Golf GTI’ Mk3 edition back in 1996. In previous years VW coincided with the reveal of these editions with the unofficial , though the event was cancelled in 2023. The Golf GTI Clubsport S is one of the most noteworthy, being a stripped-out, two-seater version and perhaps the most track-focused road-going Golf ever. Prices for these can still easily fetch upwards of £40,000. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
135,Life after Luca de Meo: why Renault thinks it will be just fine ,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/renault/luca-de-meo/,Ted Welford,2025-06-23,Car Magazine UK,"It was only shortly before it was announced to the world when Renault’s design director Laurens van den Acker received news of an urgent leadership call. He would be told of Renault CEO Luca de Meo’s shock departure. ‘I thought it [the call] would be for something else’, admits van den Acker, who has been part of Renault’s design team since 2009, and has served as the Group’s design director since 2023. Having served under five CEOs at Renault, change isn’t new for the company, but following up de Meo’s outstanding half a decade will be a challenge. As the instigator of the Renaulution, he pushed forward the Renault 5 and 4 as a way of reinventing a somewhat stale brand and has made Dacia the brand it is today. Both are now in a completely different place and are thriving. But despite de Meo leaving Renault on July 15 for pastures completely new, van den Acker tells us his story at the firm is far from over. ‘There’s more to come from Luca’s Renault. The will come, the Clio will come, some new Dacias will come. Our product plan for the next few years has already been done ‘What I’m working on now is 2028, 2029, 2030. So, very often if there is a crisis, I say the crisis has already passed. In my role in 2028 the sun is shining, the summer is good, this is way behind us.’ The Dutch design director draws comparisons between Renault and its leadership to Liverpool and its former manager Jurgen Klopp. ‘If I compare it to football, Klopp only managed in a short time but lit a fire in the brand [Liverpool]. Luca made everyone enthusiastic inside the company and outside the company, but he left behind a very good team. We’ve grown as a management team, we’re not in the same place we were five years ago clearly and I’m an optimist and if I look forward and we can do to Liverpool what Klopp did when he left then we will be doing well.’ Van den Acker clearly has much respect for de Meo and his appreciation for good design, but admits ‘he pushed us like crazy’. It’s a move that has undoubtedly paid off. The new Renault 5’s incredible design is already translating into sales – in April and May 2025 it has been the UK’s most popular electric car for retail – and it’s expected the Renault 4 arriving in dealers shortly will do similar. ‘We were losing considerable amounts of money per day [before Luca joined], we were definitely the weakest kid in the class. ‘We took a lot of hard decisions four or five years ago. The successes today is not down to what we did last week, and this is important to realise. The success in three years time will be linked to the decisions we took today.’ Despite van den Acker’s optimism, though, he’s not naive to the challenges that a new CEO brings. ‘We will again have everything to prove [with the new CEO]. People expect us to lose the momentum, and I think we are all very aware of needing to keep up the momentum because the worst thing you can do is to stop everything. We keep going.’ But Luca de Meo’s departure, as much of a shock as it may be, is not completely out of the ordinary. He did similar at Seat between 2015 and 2020, establishing the Cupra brand, which continues to grow each year, but not sticking around to see it flourish. Instead, his philosophy seem to be to get the brand back on track and then move on seems to, and one he is now looking to replicate at his next employer, struggling luxury group Kering, the parent company of firms such as Gucci and Balenciaga. ‘In any normal situation, he would have left the building straight away, because if he had gone to a competitor, he wouldn’t work for you any more’, says van den Acker. ‘But because he’s leaving for another industry, they made a deal that he leaves on the 15th July, which is quite unique.’ And as for the next Renault boss? Unsurprisingly van den Acker doesn’t want to speculate but says that ‘recruiting from within is an option’, but they’re looking outside as well. He’s very quick to rule himself out of stepping into Luca de Meo’s shoes. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
136,What's next for Maserati?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/maserati/stellantis-is-the-problem/,Gavin Green,2025-06-24,Car Magazine UK,"Bob Drake competed in only one Grand Prix, the US GP of 1960, and finished an undistinguished 13th. His Maserati 250F, the most beautiful and one of the most successful F1 cars of the ’50s, was outclassed by the new-age machinery. Stirling Moss’s winning Lotus 18-Climax was small, mid-engined and showcased the future. Drake’s 250F, on the other hand, was a glorious relic of the past. It finished seven laps behind Moss’s Lotus. It would be the 250F’s last-ever GP. Drake’s sole claim to racing fame is that he was the last man to race in a world championship Grand Prix in Maserati’s most famous racing car. There is a parallel between the 250F in 1960 and Maserati today. A company whose cars once oozed desirability is now a serial underperformer. A performance brand famous for its tuneful and characterful engines, and some wonderful old GTs, must now navigate an uncertain new age. And just as the 250F finished its career in America’s Riverside raceway in the autumn of 1960, so there are doubts about Maserati’s future today. Only a few months ago, Carlos Tavares, then boss of Maserati’s owner Stellantis, threatened to shut down unprofitable brands, a clear reference to Maserati. Last year sales collapsed to 11,300, from 26,600 the year before. In the UK, they were down 47 per cent. In Italy, by 41 per cent. Production fell 64 per cent. Even new models, like the Grecale SUV, suffered big falls. In total, Maserati sold fewer cars than Ferrari, and were not far ahead of Lamborghini – both of which operate at a much higher and more profitable plane. Instead of investing more in its sole luxury brand to boost product, Stellantis has written off £1.2 billion of investment in Maserati, leaving some future models in doubt. Under achievement at Maserati is not new. Fifty years ago almost exactly, Maserati was put into liquidation. Every decade since it’s regularly missed sales targets, as various owners – including Ferrari – grappled with familiar and recurring problems. Investment was delayed, models aged, and so the circle of strife continued. There have been some gloriously good cars, but many of those have soldiered on well past retirement age. Platform sharing to go downmarket hasn’t helped. The Grecale SUV uses Alfa Stelvio underpinnings. It is an appealing sports luxury SUV, but in many ways more like a Qashqai than a Quattroporte – and the electric Folgore version costs almost £100,000. Just over a decade ago, then-owner Fiat said Maserati would sell 75,000 cars a year. In fact, in 2025 it will be lucky to sell one-seventh of that. Like Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, Lotus and Aston Martin, Maserati is a wonderful old European brand that has struggled for decades. Stellantis has threatened to transform Maserati but, so far, there is no Jaguar-style rivoluzione. The management, though, has changed. A new CEO, Santo Ficili, was installed last October, after Tavares sacked the previous Maserati boss. A new head for Maserati Northern Europe, which includes the UK, was installed at the same time. Mariangela Del Vecchio, ex BMW, will tell you that in the past year three key models were phased out – Quattroporte, Levante and Ghibli. Little wonder sales were affected. On the other hand, new Folgore EV models were introduced, which should have boosted demand. There were technical issues that affected production and, as with most new EVs, sales have disappointed. ‘New entry-level versions of the Grecale [the 300] and GranTurismo and GranCabrio [the 490 versions] are now available, as well as the new GT2 Stradale and a full range of Folgore models,’ says Del Vecchio. She promises that 2025 will be better. An enhanced customisation ‘atelier’ programme should also earn good money: it’s a major source of Ferrari’s impressive profits. A new Quattroporte – which also replaces the Ghibli – is due in 2028 and a new Levante in 2027. The current plan is for Maserati to be EV-only by 2030, but that is surely now in doubt, given the shaky EV market, Donald Trump’s pro-oil blusterings and slow initial sales of Folgore variants. ‘We are committed to electro mobility but we are customer driven and will produce what our customers want,’ says Del Vecchio. The electric MC20 Folgore has been canned. The GranCabrio and GranTurismo Folgore models are technically ambitious EVs: bespoke 800-volt architectures, dedicated three-motor powertrains, low centre of gravities and scorching performance elevate them from any other platform-shared Stellantis cars. The GranCabrio Folgore is the world’s only GT convertible EV. I drove both electric GranCabrio and GranTurismo soon after talking to Del Vecchio. They are exquisitely handsome cars and fearsomely fast, the most powerful Maseratis ever – and with more torque than the original Bugatti Veyron. Jaguar insist its new-age EVs will sell because of the sheer desirability of their design. If so, then the stand-out handsome GranCabrio and GranTurismo should also succeed. (Although they’re expensive: the GranTurismo Folgore starts at just under £180,000). And you’d expect a new Quattroporte to look wonderful, given past efforts. Del Vecchio insists that EVs are an opportunity for Maserati. ‘Electric power suits luxury and grand touring very well.’ The idea of Stellantis selling Maserati is also quickly dismissed. When Tavares left last December, the second Stellantis brand that chairman John Elkann visited was Maserati, she says. Elkann is also executive chairman of Ferrari, another brand with a distinguished racing past – but also a highly successful present and, it seems, a rosy future. Some of that Prancing Horse magic is clearly needed at its Modenese neighbour. Intriguingly, at least one industry pundit has even called on Ferrari to regain control of its former cross-town rival.

137,Meet Sadair’s Spear – the Koenigsegg Jesko that’s somehow even more extreme,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/koenigsegg/sadair-s-spear/,Jake Groves,2025-06-25,Car Magazine UK,"Koenigsegg keeps upping the extreme. This is Sadair’s Spear, a very interestingly named hypercar from Christian von Koenigsegg and his team of hypercar heroes. Somehow, this is even more track-focused than the Jesko Attack – Koenigsegg’s most recent and also very track-focused car. And the name? Well, the inspiration comes from Jesko von Koenigsegg – Christian’s father – who was a gentleman jockey. His favourite, and his last, racehorse was named Sadair’s Spear. Power comes from a twin-turbo V8 that develops 1282bhp… using regular fuel. If you have access to some E85 juice, power increases to a whopping 1603bhp. That thumper of an engine is connected to Koenigsegg’s ‘Light Speed Transmission’ – a nine-speed gearbox which operates without a flywheel. The LST allows you to shift between gears further apart without needing to cycle through all of them. For example, if you want fourth but you’re in seventh, you can directly select fourth gear without needing to shift past gears six and five. Compared to the Jesko, the Sadair’s Spear includes completely redesigned aero including front dive planes, bonnet air vents and a new double-bladed active rear wing. New air intakes increase flow, which have enabled a 19bhp power increase, while redesigned suspension with Triplex dampers, wider tyres and carbon ceramic brakes are all included for keeping the ultimate ‘Segg on track. The Sadair’s Spear is around 35kg lighter than the Jesko, via a reduction in sound insulation and new carbonfibre construction. All of this extra oomph and precision has already produced results; the Sadair’s Spear is 1.1sec faster around the Gotland Ring than the Jesko Attack. Want one? Tough. Only 30 are being made, and they’re all already sold. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

138,Electrification and SUVs have killed niche bodystyles – but Skoda CEO says they could make 2030s comeback,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/skoda/skoda-sports-and-niche-cars/,Tim Pollard,2025-06-25,Car Magazine UK,"Ever despair that the industry’s current obsession with electrifying every which model – and seemingly turning most of them into crossovers and SUVs – is crushing the interest out of modern cars? Well, the boss of Skoda has provided a glimmer of hope. We sat down earlier today with chief executive officer Klaus Zellmer and asked about the prospects of sportier standalone models in the spirit of the 1960s Felicia (below) barging their way back in to the product pipeline. And the answer wasn’t ‘never’, it was ‘not yet.’ Cold hard business logic dictates why Skoda has spurned niche models and anything too leftfield in recent years, dropping novelties such as the and Roomster, let alone anything with a genuinely sporty silhouette. The Czech brand is instead prioritising ruthlessly mainstream bodystyles and models, as it pivots its range to the most profitable segments, prioritising tall-riding bodystyles that customers crave with a choice of powertrains to suit customers ready to plug in (EVs), hedge their bets (hybrids) or stick with the tried-and-tested (combustion engines). These cars are taking priority over niche models, Zellmer admitted. ‘Unfortunately, we don’t currently have either the financial luxury, nor the capacity, to do that. I’d love to. I would love to see a car that speaks to hearts, like a convertible or something like that – but currently our full focus is on the portfolio that covers that big footprint. Those cars would only be niche models.’ This approach appears to be working; earlier this year, Skoda Auto posted record turnover of €28 billion (£24bn) and an operating profit of €2.3bn (£1.9bn), as it sold 926,000 cars last year. Correct. It did indeed show the sports car concept for Gran Turismo back in 2024, referencing the 1100 OHC sports car from the back catalogue in the official sketches (red car, below). ‘These are little experiments – they sort of charge the brand a little bit, but the business rationale is minute, unfortunately,’ the CEO told us. ‘I’d love to see a Yeti again, because I think that car is such a great character, it has such a good name and a loyal base, you know. I’m amazed so many people still talk to me about it.’ Today’s warmed-over vRS models will continue, but Zellmer suggested that any deviation from the current model strategy would not materialise this decade, while the company rolls out its full range of battery and carefully manages the great powertrain transition. But he was more optimistic about next decade. Easy to say, perhaps, for someone whose CEO contract will have expired by then… ‘Once we have sorted out our portfolio into a certain number of cars, where each and every “hat” [bodystyle] sells more than 100,000 units a year – then you can start contemplating more ideas,’ Zellmer revealed. ‘We are already selling more than 200,000 Octavias every year. ‘Of course, our platform technology is perfect for that, because to just put a new “hat” on an existing performance car package is not such a big investment.’ ‘Currently not, but maybe in the future, yes,’ declared Zellmer. ‘The next decade would be nice.’ Here’s hoping… Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

139,Mercedes-AMG GT XX: the megawatt EV that previews new era of silent AMGs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/amg-gt-xx/,Jake Groves,2025-06-26,Car Magazine UK,"The new, much quieter era of cars from Mercedes-AMG is almost upon us and this – the new Concept AMG GT XX – is our first look. AMG’s designers and engineers have gone all out, introducing new design elements, a fresh take on the performance car and a whole lotta new performance car technology that’ll set AMG up for years to come. Of course, we already have had EVs from AMG. Remember the ? That proved an electric sports car was feasible. And, of course, you can buy an and , but they are arguably little else beyond more powerful versions of an existing EV. The GT XX, however, is a different beast entirely – developed from the ground up by AMG. And, even if AMG calls this a concept, it’s anything but. Those last two letters – ‘XX’ – are very important, pointing to the fact that this is actually more of a rolling test bed for technical innovations rather than some static show car that’ll inevitably collect dust in a museum. Look closely in the images and you’ll see door mirrors, production car wipers and even a VIN. Just like the , then. But, unlike the EQ XX that chased maximum efficiency and achieved more than 1000 kilometres on a single charge, the AMG GT XX is designed to chase maximum performance and generate power beyond one megawatt. Indeed. And notice how I said ‘beyond’? AMG engineers say one megawatt, or 1341bhp in Church of England, is just the start. You’re right to say ‘great scott!’, too, as the technology deployed here is very much like something out of . Why? Because AMG has used axial flux electric motors from . In the case of the GT XX, these motors develop a system output north of 1341bhp, good for a top speed north of 224mph. Quick recap for those at the back: in a conventional electric motor, the magnetic flux flows from the core of the motor outwards and around the edges to spin the rotor. With an axial flux motor, the force flows through the core from magnet to magnet to produce the same effect. This change in flux direction means axial flux motors don’t have to take up so much space and end up weighing less, too; AMG engineers tell us the GT XX’s motors are two thirds lighter and take up a third of the space. ‘But the real benefits we get are from the performance,’ says David Storr, electric drive component engineer for Mercedes-AMG. ‘We’ve got three times the power density and two times the torque density compared to a conventional electric motor, and we’re the first to bring these motors into a full electric vehicle.’ Three axial flux motors are applied to the GT XX – two on the rear axle and one on the front – allowing for electric all-wheel drive. The rear motors are packaged into a singular unit that AMG calls a High Performance Electric Drive Unit that also houses an planetary gearset and inverter. That front motor only kicks in when extra power is required or if you’re doing proper power oversteer drifts, disconnecting again when you’re only cruising or coasting. Extreme power outputs mean extreme battery tech, too. AMG is using cylindrical cells instead of pouch ones. Cylindrical cells are easier to cool and more can be packaged within a defined battery size than pouch cells, making the pack more energy-dense – even if it’s a more expensive configuration. The GT XX also has an 800-volt architecture, and AMG claims the battery technology is capable of extreme charging speeds. Bertram Tschamon, head of high-performance batteries at AMG, told us the GT XX could charge at an of eight hundred and fifty kilowatts, even pointing out that Mercedes had to create a new charging station capable of such extremes. ‘The battery can peak even higher than that, but we’re not interested in the peak number – we’re more interested in what it can do over a long period of time,’ says Tschamon. ‘With these speeds, you can achieve 400 kilometres [248 miles] in five minutes.’ Tschamon also confirms that this is an AMG-specific battery pack – no paltry, lower-class Mercedes-Benz model will use them. Hmm, yes – I can see what you’re getting at. Stefan Lamm, head of advanced design at AMG, points to cars like the 300 SL and , as well as the and – more recently – the for design inspiration. As part of that design walkthrough, we saw some early sketches of it during the design phase. In those early stages, the front end looked almost like Darth Vader’s helmet, but painted in orange – very cool and quite aggressive. The end result, however, is a little more rounded and soft – and disappointing. The headlights oddly look too small, too – particularly given what we’ve become used to with cars like the current AMG GT – and the wide, backlit grille is mere inches from the floor and looks as if its pointed downwards. Which is a shame, because some of the GT XX’s details are sometimes pie in the sky, but always fascinating. It’s also worth pointing out that Mercedes-AMG brought a camouflaged version of the production car to the AMG GT XX’s reveal event. All we can say is – phew – some of the jarring details from the rolling prototype’s front end aren’t making it to the real car. Either way, the GT XX is super low and actually quite compact when you’re up close to it, like someone’s shrunk the V8-powered down to three quarters its size. The orange paint is called Sunset Beam – a nod to the C11’s orange hue. ‘It’s a very vibrant colour,’ says Lamm, ‘and reminds us of the C111 as that too was a technology carrier and quite advanced for its time.’ The overall shape means extremely impressive aero, too. Lamm points to a 0.198 drag coefficient – an extremely low figure that makes this one of the most aerodynamic cars ever. There is no rear window (because concept car – no other reason) and those rear lights are inspired by jet engine afterburners. Oddly, there are also exterior speakers in the headlights. The idea means the AMG can emit noises – even rev, for those most old-school car enthusiasts – but they save weight by being integrated into the lenses. And, for a bit of retro flavour, a pixelated ‘screen’ that can be customised to show messages sits between the tail lights. And, to help achieve that sleek aero figure, there are aero inserts in the wheels powered by an actuator in the wheel hub. They slowly pop out, allowing the car to prioritise aerodynamics or brake cooling if high-speed driving is the order of the day. Bioluminescent paint is applied to the door sills; see that stripe of white? It’s backlit and can glow to show how much charge you have; AMG calls it MBUX Fluid Light Paint. AMG is keen to pare it back and make it more essential. No fripperies. That’s for Mercedes-Benz to deal with, not Affalterbach. The almost racing car-spec interior includes contoured carbonfibre seats, metallic details that look like heat sinks and a steering wheel a lot like that on the AMG One. Interior designer Matthias Hauser says he and the design team were keen to up the quality of the surroundings, too, with details like milled metal AMG badging on the dashboard and a centre console that’s meant to look like the super durable materials you see in an engine block. ‘We wanted to make the technology very visible,’ says Hauser, ‘and we wanted to make no compromises. Just like the exterior, our mission from the outset was to design the GT XX to clearly show what it is: a technology carrier and a preview of forthcoming AMGs on the AMG.EA platform.’ Mercedes is also developing a new artificial leather that feels as soft as Nappa but feels much stronger; for the GT XX, the ‘leather’ material is derived from recycled AMG GT3 racing car tyres where the fibres are broken down using biochemistry. ‘Underneath the biotech leather alternative, you also have 3D-printed seat pads,’ says Eva Weckenmann, innovations manager (cool job title) for the GT XX project. ‘That allow us to individualise them to the shape of the driver,’ Yes, alright – fine. Some of the details – like the aero wheel inserts and the MBUX Fluid Light Paint – are still in the pre-production stage, we’re told, but more of the GT XX’s technology is ready to go than you may think. The battery technology and new axial flux electric motors, for example, are ready to launch, with their first production car deployment being in . After that, , while CAR’s intel suggests a two-door coupe and convertible will arrive from 2028 onwards. ‘The engine has always been the heart of AMG from the Red Pig to the AMG One,’ says Storr. ‘It’s always been the central component of everything we make, and that should be the same in an electric world.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

140,What's next for Gordon Murray?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/gordan-murray/next-supercar/,Colin Overland,2025-06-26,Car Magazine UK,"Coffee pods. Jean-Phillipe Launberg has carrier bags full of them in his office at the Gordon Murray Group. They will be recycled and used in the lightweight supercar prototype that’s being created for 2027 by a multi-company project he’s leading. He’s serious: ‘We’ve been using virgin aluminium [in Gordon Murray Automotive cars], because that’s the strongest you can get. But something that started at Innovate UK has been progressing, using consumer scrap. In my office I have something like 80kg of Nespresso pods. I’m going to make a full vehicle structure using those! ‘We have all the aluminium we need in the UK – we need to re-use it. So let’s turn recycled consumer scrap into an aluminium that’s actually stronger and better than the virgin one we use today.’ It won’t be easy. After all, just about everything Gordon Murray has put his name to over his many decades as a boundary-pushing F1 and road-car engineer is already ultra-light. But then again, Murray surrounds himself with kindred spirits who aim very high. If anyone can do it, they can. In 2027, a prototype supercar built around a new monocoque will be demonstrated at a proving ground, showcasing various lightweight and sustainable materials and techniques. After that, the learnings from the project could spread far and wide. Innovation is never-ending within the Murray operation. ‘Sometimes it’s for the market and sometimes it’s for ourselves, but we have to find ways to continue pushing the boundaries. ‘For our types of cars, which do very low mileage on average, a lot of the environmental impact is not in the usage phase but in the manufacturing phase. There’s a lot of carbon in carbonfibre. And if you were to make it electric, although there’s no tailpipe emissions the lifecycle impact is high if you don’t keep it as light as possible. ‘So we’re using materials which have already been used before, and looking at how to minimise the use of carbonfibre at the design stage, and minimising waste in the production processes.’ The consortium working on Project M-LighteEn, led by the Gordon Murray Group, also involves composites specialist Carbon ThreeSixty, aluminium experts Constellium and metallurgists at London’s Brunel University. With AI playing a big part in the development work, the targets are ambitious: 25 per cent lighter than a comparable chassis today, 50 per cent greener, and using 80 per cent recycled ultra-high-strength aluminium. (The project name is a contraction of monocoque, lightweight and low energy, fact fans.) Funded by the government-backed Innovate UK and the Advanced Propulsion Centre (a non-profit organisation that helps find and allocate R&D funding), the project will lead to the creation of 160 new jobs and around £150 million of economic activity, if all goes well. They’re building digital and physical prototype monocoques. ‘We have low volumes and we are willing to experiment. We are innovators and early adopters, and then it can be used in higher volumes across the industry in different applications,’ says Launberg. ‘No one will say “I’ll make 500,000 vehicles a year” if it’s the first one. It might hurt your bottom line. The large OEMs are more conservative. Everyone likes to be the second, not the first,’ says Launberg. ‘In this project we will design a supercar structure, because we will be the first ones to use the solution. That’s what we have in our hearts and what we know how to do best. The project will deliver a supercar structure that’s validated in the lab and validated in manufacturing as well. We are not developing a future model, but future models will be based on this work, drawing on these learnings.’ But the big win comes if and when those learnings spread into the wider industry. ‘The solutions are totally powertrain agnostic. Whether you’re carrying a battery pack or a V12 or a three-cylinder mild hybrid, it’s up to the OEM.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
141,"Audi has ‘reached the peak’ of design complexity, says designer Gary Telaak",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/design/,Jake Groves,2025-06-27,Car Magazine UK,"We’re not saying anything controversial here when we say that Audi design has become more complex and less easy on the eye. Audi, which has just acknowledged 60 years of what it considers to be the brand it is today, has moved from functional and cleanly designed cars like the original 80 and 100 to ones that are beset with creases, vents and aggression. We are, however, starting to see signs that the brand will step away from this design complexity with future models with new chief creative officer Massimo Frascella at the helm. Frascella has been in his role at Audi for a year now – taking over from Marc Lichte. Before Audi, he designed the current Land Rover Defender, as well as the latest Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models; all clean and/or functional designs that look remarkably like the brand they’re from, without being over the top. Something Audi arguably needs right now. At an event celebrating this 60-year period of modern-day Audi design at a Frank Gehry-designed hotel in northern Spain, exterior designer Gary Telaak gives us a walkthrough of some of the brand’s key models. Among those models are an 80 and a 100, as well as an Ur Quattro and a few RS models – all from the Audi UK heritage fleet. There are discussions of cleanliness, function, details like the Singleframe grille evolving from being something that originally marked the Audi V8 model becoming a signature of the brand’s cars. After Telaak has given us his walkthrough, the one that’s become a magnet to him while at the event is the RS2 Avant – the Porsche-enhanced fire-breather of an estate car that kicked off the Audi RS brand. He’s desperate to drive it, having never had the chance prior – so CAR hitches a ride with him. ‘I’m freaking out right now,’ he beams as we climb in. ‘This location? These cars? That’s my life!’ This RS2, like many of the cars (RS or otherwise) in the line-up on the event, are subtle but purposeful. No overdone creases, no oversized vents and no aggressive faces. Not a busy or complicated design. While we drive, Telaak explains to us the design evolution; ‘it’s sometimes technology that can make things, as you say, ‘busier.’ For example, we are regularly showing details like the quattro blisters to emphasise four-wheel drive.’ ‘Right now, we’re also playing a lot with light and shadow,’ he adds. ‘It’s important if you want to express specific proportions and make the car look slimmer. Sometimes the package you’re working with doesn’t give you what you want to have in terms of its proportions. ‘We use blisters and undercuts to break the surface, break the volume and create a proportion we want to see. We have probably reached the peak of this sort [of design],’ Telaak adds. So, does that mean Audi designs will become simpler, stepping away from this aggressive and over-styled look? He simply smirks, and says: ‘possibly.’ Indeed, CAR understands that we’ll see a preview of Audi’s future design direction via a show car at the 2025 Munich motor show. ‘This is, I think, our first point of attention: to treat the skin, not to overload it and leave out what is not necessary,’ Telaak adds. Being in the RS2 is another case in point, as Audi RS cars were always designed to be sleepers. You had to know an RS car when you looked one, with cars like this and the B5 RS4 showing very few clues to the performance that lied beneath the surface. Now, though, RS models are extreme, aggressive and showy in their designs. Telaak agrees as he carves up the mountain roads in the RS2; ‘just look at ,’ he says. But he also adds that treading that line between design simplicity and aggression is an even thinner one with RS models. ‘You have to respect the customers,’ he says, ‘and many RS customers expect this [aggression]. You will always be torn between those two extremes, and with RS you have to find the right balance. RS is a community, and it has evolved into something more extreme and radical in terms of expression.’ What should Audi bring back to its design, then? ‘I think the logic of it,’ Telaak responds. ‘Just take the normal A3 as an example. The architecture and structure of the car is all there, with its massive C-pillar.. that is distinctively an A3. You recognise it immediately. It has creases, but not many. This is very Audi.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

142,In-depth with HWA's EVO: a DTM racing legend resurrected for 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/hwa-evo-restomod/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-28,Car Magazine UK,"In 2025 there are two distinct flavours AMG; the ‘official’ electric type showcased in the new , and then this – the brawny HWA EVO. Crafted to harness AMG’s golden era in a modern performant shell, it’s the ultimate modern classic. Just 100 will be made and next year it’ll also race in the hugely demanding N24h race. But before all that, we spoke to CTO Gordian von Schoening about the project. ‘We were looking for something that combines our legacy, but also our racing history,’ CTO Gordian von Schoening tells me ahead of this year’s N24 race. We’re talking in 30-degree heat on HWA’s huge stand at the Nürburgring, surrounded by two new EVO cars, as well as an example of the rare Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evo II DTM racer on which they’re based. But HWA nearly didn’t go for the classic 190E at all. After picking the modern classic era, HWA picked the 190E as it was the base for creating something that looked like the EVO II which it formed a platform for – but was far easier and cheaper to get a hold of. ‘There’s only 500 EVO IIs built in the EU for the homologation of the DTM, but 1.6 million 190Es were built over the car’s lifecycle,’ he tells me. A check on eBay will show a good 190E going for far less than the half a million Euros an original EVO II costs; and for just an extra €700,000-ish HWA will turn it into something, ‘a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more powerful, but that can drive really good.’ ‘The idea was to keep it very original,’ says von Schoening – and that’s exactly what’s happened. Look at the HWA EVO in isolation and it looks almost exactly like the 190E EVO II it’s inspired by – but look at the two cars side by side and it’s quite different. ‘We didn’t’ want to build something new, because the headlights are a face, especially if you have day running lights,’ he says. ‘We just wanted to keep it like it is, and that’s why we ended up as we see it today.’ I’m told the plan was to recreate the EVO as your memory imagined it, and that meant a wider track, bigger aero and cleaner lines than the original car had. HWA has been less sympathetic underneath: Each EVO starts with a W201 chassis, inspected by HWA engineers – but after that things take a turn. The front and rear portions of the original steel chassis are removed, replaced with HWA-designed high-strength steel and aluminium subframes for improved rigidity. ‘The middle piece is a steel chassis, the platform is completely new,’ he tells me. ‘It’s an integrated roll cage, and we have just put a kind of a hat on top of it’ At the front and rear cast-aluminium components are joined to the middle, and HWA bits are then clamped on. ‘We bolt on our engine frame and the gearbox frame in the back.’ The A, B and C pillars have also been strengthened. Altogether 75 per cent of the car is replaced, resulting in double the torsional stiffness. After all the modifications the EVO has similar stiffness to a modern supercar. The drivetrain sees the most change, with HWA’s engineers looking to improve weight distribution throughout. The original car’s four- or six-cylinder engine is gone, replaced with a V6 twin-turbo from a C43, along with the prop shaft. ‘We have an engine in the front, but it’s actually moved as backward as possible behind the front axle,’ von Schoening explains, adding that the front-axle has been moved forward 50mm. A V8 was also trialled, but its increased size meant it was impossible to achieve the desired weight distribution. ‘We have a dry sump system, and a prop shaft that this is running engine speed. We have in the back a gearbox that includes the alternator, the compressor for the air condition, steering pump, and the starter and the clutch.’ The result is a car that achieves 45:55 weight distribution. The brakes are Brembo steels or ceramics (customers decide) and KW dampers are also used – electric or manually adjustable depending on which configuration customers go for. Finally, H&R roll bars are thrown in. In order to further tap into its racing heritage, the Evo will race the ‘Ring next year, but its racing heritage mean there’ll be very little changes. ‘We’re going to have a paddle shift system,’ von Schoening tells me. We will have all the safety systems, like a fire distinguisher, completely installed. These are mandatory things to raise here, FIA roll cage, etc.’ HWA is a German engineering and racing-specialist firm with deep ties to AMG and the motorsport wing of Mercedes-Benz. The company name is an initialism of its founder, Hans-Werner Aufrecht, who started HWA in Affalterbach, Germany, as a managing team for Mercedes’ motorsport interests in 1999. Affalterbach has been the hometown of engine specialists AMG since 1976, a company also founded by Aufrecht in 1967.

143,HWA confirms more AMG restomods are coming,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mercedes-benz/hwa/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-06-30,Car Magazine UK,"HWA has tapped into a rich vein of car culture with its – and it has no plans to stop. Speaking to CAR at the Nürburgring 24-hour race, CTO Gordian von Schoening revealed there would be further products after the EVO – with several cars in AMG’s rich history already being looked at. At just over €0.7 million, the EVO isn’t cheap, but after 100 models HWA will be keen to improve on its ROI: ‘I can say that the development cost, and the investment into such a program is quite high,’ von Schoeningsaid.  ‘And it wouldn’t really return if we would just stick to one product.’ The EVO project has involved R&D and exists on a scale not usually seen in most restomod projects, with HWA already putting the EVO through crash testing. Next year it’ll race in the N24 race, too. ‘Our idea is to not build more than 100 [EVO] cars, because that’s a limitation, but there will be other products, let’s say, in the future,’ told CAR.  ‘I think there is also other very significant and logical cars in the pipeline.’ So, what cars could those be? HWA seems to have hit a sweet spot with AMG’s modern-timer or modern classic era, and it won’t be looking too far for its next vehicle. CAR understands that the next vehicle from HWA could be the larger brother of the 190E: that points to either the W124 in 500E or 300E Hammer form. Both come from the drawing board of Bruno Sacco, and HWA already has experience in updating his beefed-up, AMG-ified lines for 2025. Both cars also carry that mythos and prestige of 80s–90s Affalterbach creations. Whichever car they chose, it’ll be logical step, and play into HWA’s mission to drag AMG’s most iconic cars into 2025. HWA is hell-bent on making holy grails for petrolheads – so I naturally asked about a fast wagon, too. It’s not out of the question: ‘We have actually clients asking us to actually go from this car already into a wagon,’ von Schoening told me. ‘So why not? I’m happy to convert a car, if somebody thinks that would be suitable for them.’ HWA believes it’ll be able to make a car a week, which means the EVO run will be finished by 2027. Expect the next model to appear soon after. HWA is a German engineering and racing-specialist firm with strong ties to AMG and the motorsport wing of Mercedes-Benz.

In a statement released today, Sauber Motorsport (which Audi will take over next year) has revealed it’ll be opening a new technology centre in Bicester. That puts it bang in the middle of ‘Motorsport Valley,’ (the traditional home of most F1 teams) just before its transition to Audi F1. According to a statement, the new facility won’t replace Sauber’s existing Hinwil base in Switzerland, but support it. In addition to forging links with the specialist companies and expertise that exists in ‘Motorsport Valley’ the new base will also act as a hub to attract new and upcoming talent. After all, not everyone wants to move to Switzerland for work – nor Maranello for that matter. ‘The opening of the Sauber Motorsport Technology Centre at Bicester Motion is a significant milestone as we prepare for Audi’s arrival in Formula 1’ said the head of Audi F1 project, Mattia Binotto. As the ex-team principal of Ferrari, he’s no stranger to trying to drag motorsport talent abroad. Perhaps this move ‘This facility will allow us to tap into the talent pool in Motorsport Valley and further strengthen our technical capabilities while being part of a thriving cluster at Bicester Motion where you live and breathe motorsport. The support it will play to Hinwil will be important to our long-term success.’ Sauber/Audi will use Building 123 in the heart of Motorsport Valley, but more specifically on the 444-acres of the Bicester Motion estate. ‘It is thrilling that Bicester Motion has been chosen as their UK base connecting into their Swiss and German operations to support their vision to deliver sustainability, innovation, and maximum performance in motorsport,’ said Daniel Geoghegan, the Bicester Motion CEO. ‘They join many other pioneering automotive and aviation companies, along with Motorsport UK, the governing body of this great industry, already based here.

146,New Ferrari Amalfi: glamorous two-door GT replaces the Roma,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/amalfi/,Ben Barry,2025-07-01,Car Magazine UK,"Considering Ferrari has aimed to be a more unpredictable car company over the last few years, its new Amalfi is – on the face of it – an entirely predictable proposition. Replacement for the , spiritual successor to Maranello’s gorgeous GTs of the 1950s and ’60s, this V8, rear-wheel drive  ‘2+ coupe’ gently updates its six-year-old predecessor’s exterior and interior design, freshens up the infotainment and gives the mechanicals a shot of espresso. All of which you’ll find on page one of the facelift formbook. Yet dig a little deeper and there’s significantly more at play here than a gentle nip and tuck – from the Amalfi’s design through to its engine architecture. The exterior design, for starters, because – according to Ferrari design boss Flavio Manzoni – the body is much more thoroughly reworked than first impressions suggest. Yes, the Amalfi continues to be built around an aluminium architecture, the wheelbase is unchanged and – indeed – the glasshouse is identical, but every panel is described as new. The most obvious change is the front grille – the eggcrate-style perforations are gone, replaced by a cleaner ‘sharknose’ and aggressive lower bib. ‘We were keen to avoid the anthropomorphic look,’ said design boss Flavio Manzoni at the press launch. Elsewhere, you might note the sleeker, more technical look to the head- and taillights, the crisper outline or a reprofiled bonnet bulge, and how those fulsome haunches flow into redesigned door panels. Manzoni talked about pursuing a ‘minimalist, technical and pure’ approach, and of creating ‘sleek, monolithic speedforms’ with ‘master lines that define the structure’. Shown here in the launch colour of Verde Costiera and on 20-inch alloys (the only size offered), there’s no question the Amalfi is a looker. Again the Amalfi favours gentle evolution here, with a wraparound cockpit that partitions the driver and passenger compartments. So the fundamentals are the same but there’s a newfound sense of space – the centre console now lies horizontally and is made from a piece of anodized aluminium machined from a single block, where the previous design raked up at an angle, consuming much visual real estate. There’s also a new infotainment system with three screens – the lowered centre console allowing for a 10.25-inch-wide horizontal central capacitive touchscreen to replace the previous portrait orientation. The front seats are quite firm, the rears tiny, and the driving position good – the relatively small-diameter steering wheel and thin rim feels a particularly good fit. The Amalfi also marks a return to physical multi-function controls and engine start button on the steering wheel – a tacit admission that the capacitive functions on current Ferrari wheels are distractingly unintuitive. The Amalfi treads a fine line when it comes to performance – on the one hand it’s tasked with easing new customers into the Ferrari fold, including those who do not wish to be scared witless by a Prancing Horse on the lockstops; on the other it must dial up ‘adrenaline’ compared to the Roma. The spider diagram shown by on the press launch claimed gains in handling, acceleration and braking performance. Most interesting, perhaps, is the Amalfi’s F154 engine. Like Roma, it’s s a 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8 pushed so far back in the nose it’s almost in the cabin, features a complete absence of hybrid tech and now produces a here-nor-there 20bhp extra, for 631bhp all in. But Ferrari has sweated the details, including camshafts that are some 1.3kg lighter, new faster spinning turbos (to 171,000rpm), and a new Bosch management system that allows for finer control of the pair of them. It’s also shaved about a kilo off the engine block – which sounds like an awful lot of toil for an improvement that pro drivers would struggle to detect, let alone nervy amateurs stroking it along the Amalfi coast. Either way, the takeaway is what appears to be a very gently massaged V8 should feel more responsive and sound quite different to the Roma’s already impressive unit. All that 631bhp still goes to the rear wheels alone via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, which could sound less than benign for the uninitiated. When I suggested to Gianmaria Fulgenzi – Ferrari’s chief product development officer – that many drivers may still find such a generous amount of shove a little intimidating, and that optional all-wheel drive might be an idea, he demurred, noting it would change the 50/50 weight distribution and add complexity. Instead, Ferrari has added its brake-by-wire ABS Evo system, 6D chassis sensor and updated Side-Slip Control 6.1 to keep things under control – systems that we’ve found highly effective at keeping the much more powerful 296 GTB in check. Versus Roma, driving modes are said to be less aggressive in Wet and Comfort settings with improved ride quality, then more energetic thereafter. Just that European cars are planned to go on sale in Q1 of 2026, priced from €240,000 in Italy – including Ferrari’s impressive seven-year maintenance programme with no mileage restrictions, which suggests a price increase of a little below 10%. UK prices won’t be confirmed until later this year. There’s no word yet on the Amalfi Spider’s arrival, and logic would suggest it’ll be a while yet, given the Roma drop-top landed a couple of years later than the coupe. Then again, Ferrari is the unpredictable car company, and they’ll no doubt keep us guessing until the Spider’s silks slip off.

The new information came as part of Xiaomi’s ‘New Beginnings’ event in Beijing, where it was released along with further updates on the company’s other products – including smartphones and smart glasses. With that in mind, Xiaomi has revealed the YU7 will be available in three versions: Standard, Pro and Max. Prices are of course extremely flexible given the political climate and local tariffs and tax breaks – but an initial price of mid-20s to low 30s suggests the YU7 pricing is just as punchy as the SU7’s. With more angles to inspect, the Xiaomi looks relatively handsome and unique. There’s a strong lineage so the SU7 saloon, but it appears Xiaomi’s engineers haven’t borrowed too heavily from their Western competitors.  Like the SU7 there’s a hint of McLaren in the headlights, and perhaps a bit of DBX in the body – but otherwise the YU7 looks like very much its own thing. I’ll be available a very non-Western range of vibrant colours too; from Lava Orange and Emerald Green to Dusk Purple and Shadow Teal. Of course, there’s also a Basalt Grey available for more monotone tastes. Wheel options range from 19-inch diamond-cut alloys to 21-inch forged wheels. All three feature silly levels of power, as is expected for electric SUVs in 2025. Take the Max, which we do have the most solid figures for: its 800-volt powertrain makes 681bhp, will do 0-62mph in 3.23 seconds and has a top speed of 157mph. Thanks to an earlier leak we know a bit more about how it makes that power: an image from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s claimed it’ll have a 295bhp motor on the front and 386bhp on the rear axle. That now checks out. Although not said specifically by Xiaomi, CAR understands the YU7 uses battery sizes of 94.3kWh and 101kWh. The car will float on a front double wishbone suspension with a five-link independent setup at the rear, coupled with dual-chamber closed air springs with adjustable dampers. The whole thing is stopped by Brembo four-piston fixed calipers. We’ve only got CLTC figures for now, but the Standard version has a quoted 519-mile range, with the all-wheel drive versions both doing 478 miles. Xiaomi quotes a 10-80% charge in 12 minutes, with 385 miles of charge taking just 15 minutes. The Xiaomi’s interior goes extremely big on tech, but that’s to be expected from a brand that’s made its name in smartphone and tablets. There are dual 80-watt, cooled charging pads for phones, along with a 4.6-litre smart fridge in some trims – and the range-topping Max trim also gets smart-dimming panoramic roof glass. You’ll also find 27-watt power outlets around the cabin and nine magnetic points that can be used for accessories such as tissue boxes or sunglass cases. The modding continues with a 4k add-on for the rear-view camera. The UI also comes with a few novel tricks: Apple CarPlay can now be run alongside native apps, and those with an Apple Watch will be able to control aspects of the YU7 remotely. Xiaomi has thrown in two ‘co-pilots’ a capybara and an otter that hang out on screen, but the most interesting feature must be its  ’Motion Sickness Relief Mode.’ Developed in association with Huashan Hospital and Beijing Tongren Hospital it’ll put the YU7’s chassis on its best behaviour, dulling down the g-forces and smoothing the feel of the car. Xiaomi says this reduced the starting of motion sickness by 51%. ADAS-wise it’s powered by 11 high-definition cameras, 12 ultrasonic radar and Nvidia’s latest AGX Thor chip, though it remains to be seen how much of the autonomous tech will survive if and when the YU7 makes it to the UK. In terms of other practicalities stats: the Xiaomi gets a 687-litre boot, along with a 141-litre frunk. There’s still no detail when it comes Xiaomi’s plans for the UK, though one would think its launch is imminent. After all, its recent inclusion in Gran Turismo suggests it’s now thinking more globally than ever before. .

148,Geely will release its own cars in the UK – and it’s tapped up Lotus for help,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/geely/ex5/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-07-02,Car Magazine UK,"Geely is launching in the UK with a new electric SUV called the EX5. If you’re thinking you’ve heard this all before, we understand; Geely is the automotive giant behind the likes of Volvo, Lotus Cars, Polestar and (some of) Smart. Only now it’s deciding to go it alone in the UK, too. It’s interesting, then, that Geely Auto would decide not to capitalise on its existing roster of household brands and instead badge the EX5 as its own car. Geely’s ‘Five by Five’ strategy will see it focus on expanding its global presence through five global centres for design, R&D, testing and powertrain operations. It’s hoping to strengthen its market share, as well as increase exports by 53%. The UK market is next in line to help Geely achieve those aims. The EX5 meets the regulatory requirements of 89 countries and will be available in both right-hand drive and as a left-hooker, making a truly global car. It is, of course, an electric C-segment SUV. To make it even more universally palatable for a crossover-mad world. Geely says UK-spec cars have already undergone customer clinics, but they’ll work more on localisation issues for the British market. ‘We know the Geely EX5 is a great product with several core features that will appeal to a British audience,’ said Mike Yang, general manager at Geely Auto UK. ‘That’s why we chose it to be our first passenger car for sale in the UK. However, we’re aware that UK customers have unique demands.’ To help refine the EX5 to UK tastes, Geely is also drawing on the know-how of Lotus Engineering, in a move that is both logical and surreal at the same time. ‘Lotus Engineering has a formidable track record along with some of the best R&D resources, so we’re delighted to be working closely with them,’ Yang added. With that in mind, Lotus is working on both chassis and dynamics development along with thorough testing on road, track and a multi-post rig. What Lotus engineers thought of the EX5, and the scope of their possible changes, remains to be seen. Either way, Geely hopes it’ll make the EX5 suited for European roads and driving styles. The styling of the Geely EX5 looks understated in looks and character. Boxy, non-descript and subtly styled, it’s certainly tapping strong levels of hire-car chic. Interior pictures suggest a large touchscreen and digital dials in the cockpit, but there’s very little else to go on. It should be released in the UK later in 2025.

149,The Mercedes VLE looks like it'll have a really long range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/vle/,Graham King,2025-07-03,Car Magazine UK,"This is our first sight of the upcoming Mercedes-Benz VLE electric MPV in the real world – albeit heavily disguised. And Mercedes has been putting it through its paces, driving across the Alps from Stuttgart to Rome. Nothing particularly unusual in that when there’s a prototype to validate. But what’s notable here is Mercedes’ claim that the journey was completed with just two 15-minute charging stops. To save you looking at Google Maps, it’s 1090km (677 miles) from Stuttgart to Rome, with long stretches of motorways and mountain passes. Mercedes produces some of the longest-range EVs on the market, the top-grade EQS having a WLTP range of up to 481 miles. The results of this test suggest the VLE will have best-in-sector range by some margin – the current Mercedes EQV manages 222 miles, the Ford E-Tourneo Custom runs out at 190 miles. The VLE is based on Mercedes’ modular Van Architecture electric platform that’ll be rolled out from 2026. There will be two MPVs spun off from it, which Mercedes has dubbed Grand Limousines. The VLE seen here is the more everyday option with seats for up to eight people, aimed at families and airport shuttle services. There will also be the VLS, an ultra-luxe version that will probably be mostly used by VIPs who prefer getting into the back of a vehicle through sliding doors. Undisguised, the VLE/VLS will likely look like a toned-down version of the Vision V concept (pictured below) that was unveiled in April 2025. The images of the prototype suggest its front end is a similar shape, but the sides appear less rounded. We haven’t seen any images of the VLE’s interior yet. All we know of the VLE prototype’s spec is that it has rear-wheel steering which, Mercedes says, provides “easy and agile handling” on Rome’s narrow streets. There weren’t any clues when the Vision V was revealed, either. All the information concerned the interior’s bleeding-edge tech and hyper-luxurious materials, some of which may find their way into the VLS – the triple-screen display that divides front from rear, for instance.

150,Ariel’s new Atom 4RR is an extreme 25th anniversary special,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ariel/atom-4rr/,Jake Groves,2025-07-03,Car Magazine UK,"Ariel has wheeled out the candles and party poppers, celebrating 25 years of the Ariel Atom with this: the 4RR. Just 25 will be made. It’s the most extreme and most powerful version of the Atom yet (even topping the wild V8 version), and uses a 525bhp 2.0-litre turbo from Honda. Ariel has managed to squeeze so much power out of the four-cylinder by overhauling and strengthening many of the engines components and improving its oil and cooling systems. The structure and aerodynamics build on , with Ariel calling this a ‘track-focused’ (and therefore not ‘track-only’) model. More technical specs will be revealed later in 2025. Ariel as we currently know it has been around since 2000 when the first Atom launched. The extreme and clean-sheet sports car found a niche and enthusiastic crowd – and was no doubt propelled into many a car enthusiast’s consciousness (including mine) by a certain car journalist-turned farm owner in the early 2000s. Since then, Ariel has constantly evolved the Atom – usually by upping the power of the Honda engines it’s always used. The general structure has hardly changed, though, with Atoms (and the off-road Nomads that have come since) still proudly looking like scaffolding with wheels attached. Those 25 owners, then, are getting the most extreme Atom yet. Lucky them. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017. With a decade of car news and reviews writing under his belt, he became CAR's Deputy News Editor in 2020 and then News Editor in 2025.

151,The electric slide: Alpine A290 Rallye unveiled,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a290-rallye/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-03,Car Magazine UK,"Alpine’s motorsport engineers will soon be quite un-busy. The brand will at the end of 2025 – and, with the F1 season already underway, there’s not much work left to do. So, to save themselves from boredom, Alpine’s best racing minds have been pouring their energy into this. The new A290 Rallye. As the name suggests, it’s a rally-ready version of the hot hatchback. It was designed to conform to the latest rally regulations, while acting as an affordable means for amateur drivers to get started in the sport. Power and torque are identical to the standard car at 220hp and 300Nm, but you get a host of mechanical upgrades to make the platform better suited to the rough and tumble world of rallying. The changes include a ZF limited-slip differential, new dampers from ALP Racing, wider 18-inch EVO Corse wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport A tyres. The brakes have been upgraded too – the Rallye has new, six-piston monobloc calipers with 350mm discs at the front and single-piston calipers with 280mm discs at the rear. There are plenty of cosmetic tweaks, as well. You get wider wheel arches to cover the fatter wheels and tyres, a deeper front splitter, a matte black bonnet to cut down on a glare and a roof scoop to get some fresh air into the cabin on a sweaty special stage. Alpine hasn’t neglected the safety gear, either. The interior gets a pair of Sabelt racing seats and a roll cage, both of which conform to current FIA regulations. So, once the brand has confirmed the rally class the A290 Rallye is allowed to compete in, you should be able to rock up to an event in the car as a privateer. But the best part about the Alpine A290 Rallye is its hydraulic handbrake. As Alpine’s images show, that addition means you’ll be able to back it into corners like Jean Ragnotti. Perhaps my fear about the was premature. And the price of all this electric lairiness? £51,000 excluding VAT which, for a fully loaded, race-ready rally car doesn’t seem like bad value to me. The A290 Rallye will make its dynamic debut at the 2025 before being whisked off the Mont-Blanc rally in September. After that, Alpine plans to launch a single-make rally series for owners to compete in.

152,Aston Martin’s new empire: how Stroll is building F1 supremacy,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/aston-martin/f1-stroll-team/,Ben Miller,2025-07-04,Car Magazine UK,"Welcome to the most recently completed of three sleek buildings on the Aston Martin Formula One Team campus. More secretive than the other two, it’s furthest from prying eyes and has fewer windows. And it’s called Building Three. Clearly when you’re spending hundreds of millions, chasing thousandths and laying the foundations for a trophy-rich dynasty, there’s no time to sit around brainstorming cute building names. Deep in Building Three’s bowels, at ground level but with no views of the grounds or countryside beyond, the ambience is more outer space than just outside Silverstone. In the relative gloom, certainly when you walk here directly from the bright-as-day car-build bays next door, faintly sinister rows of expensive machinery hum as they work. They’re busy batch-printing resin parts for the 60% wind tunnel model. Since the process is like building a full-sized skyscraper in Lego, one tiny layer at a time, it is not fast – the display on one indicates it’ll be finished the day after tomorrow. Others, their windows periodically flashing a ghoulish green, are printing parts of unfathomably elaborate design from powdered aluminium or titanium. AMF1 is more than a customer for these machines – its competitive hunger to push limits has put it right at the vanguard of the technology, along with NASA. After all, why burn fuel taking a full set of spanners into space when you can print the one you need up there? Upstairs somewhere, one of the facility’s prize assets – its new wind tunnel – is undergoing final checks. Previously, the team used Mercedes-AMG’s tunnel when Mercedes-AMG weren’t (so, evenings and weekends) and wore grooves in a nine-mile stretch of the A43 as a consequence. Elsewhere on the campus, the greatest car designer the sport has ever seen, Adrian Newey, stands at the world’s most famous drawing board. After 18 riotously successful years with Red Bull, he started at Aston Martin a couple of weeks ago. His office – a glass lighthouse of experience and creativity in a sea of CAD monitors and furrowed brows – feels as much a display case for this talismanic hire as a place of work. Just down the corridor, behind closed doors, sits another state-of-the-art piece of equipment, AMF1’s new driver-in-the-loop simulator (as opposed to a simulator without a driver, which is also a thing). Unseen, servers run warm as Aston engineers collaborate with those of Honda Motor Company and HRC half a world away. The Japanese company, creator of some of the finest and fiercest engines the sport has ever seen, will be AMF1’s powertrain partner for the sport’s new-regulation era, arriving 2026. And outside, amid beautiful planting and grasses that sway artfully in the stiff spring breeze, there’s a helipad – a helipad that, once a week, receives the man driving this revolution. Welcome to the Aston Martin Formula One team campus, the Rome that Lawrence Stroll is building. Organisations often talk about being more than the sum of their parts. As of right now, if this team were anything like the sum of its parts it’d win every race it entered. Its facilities are state of the art. Its recent hires read like an F1 super group, from the aforementioned Newey through ex-Ferrari aerodynamics man Enrico Cardile and former Mercedes AMG powertrain guru Andy Cowell, who joined as group CEO and was recently appointed team principal, too. Its title sponsor Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s majority state-owned gas and oil company, isn’t short of funds. And on the power unit side, Honda will replace current supplier Mercedes-AMG from 2026. Honda power units have won the last four drivers’ championships and two of the last three constructors’ titles. This team, which began life as plucky underdogs Jordan more than 35 years ago, stands poised to dominate a sport transformed out of all recognition. An insular personal playset when Bernie Ecclestone relinquished control nearly a decade ago, the sport has since conquered Netflix, hijacked the global news agenda on Premier League transfer deadline day (Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari!) and made the teams that contest it wealthier in the process. If AMF1 can become serial winners it’ll be the result of an acquisition of excellence so clear-eyed and uncompromising it’d make Pep Guardiola blush. And if it happens it’ll be because the team – with Andy Cowell at its core – managed to tune this campus, this engine of a thousand people and an awful lot of raw talent, into a winning machine. You can’t point to a single aspect of what we’re doing here as pivotal, and that’s the whole point,’ Cowell tells . ‘It’s a union of all of these things, and it stems from Lawrence’s vision for the team.’ (A consortium led by billionaire Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll bought Force India’s assets in 2018, establishing the Racing Point team that then re-branded as Aston Martin when Stroll became part-owner and executive chairman of the car company.) ‘He came in and said, “I want this team to win. I want this team to get to the front,” and he’s taken the time to speak to people and understand what’s required. So, the wind tunnel. The driver-in-the loop simulator. A significantly bigger factory. Works team status, a partnership with Honda and developing our own transmission [because F1 gearboxes are fundamental to both the car’s aerodynamics and its rear suspension layout, designing your own is essential for a works team with title aspirations]. Bringing together a larger group of people as we transition from surviving customer team to works entity, in which we create everything ourselves. It’s all here. Now it’s about bringing it all together efficiently and effectively.’ Cowell was a part of Mercedes as it geared up to dominate F1’s first hybrid era, which started with the 2014 season. Does being a part of this team now feel anything like being a part of Mercedes AMG then? Is there a familiarity to this calm before the storm of champagne and championship wins? ‘It comes down to the vision. At Mercedes that was “the best or nothing” – that was our approach,’ he says. ‘It took a few years to embed, but you could see that by the middle of 2013 [when Cowell was  Managing Director of Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains] Mercedes were capable of winning races. The new power unit [in 2014] provided a step, as did the aero changes that came with it. Then there was just a determination to stay there – that even though we were at the front, we wanted to keep winning. ‘Here the job is to instil the same focus. If our performance improvement over time is greater than our opponents, then we’ll overtake them. And if we can keep our gradient of improvement over time greater than our opponents, we’ll stay ahead of them. For every department, whether it’s communications or HR or vehicle dynamics or aerodynamics, it’s about an obsessive approach to improvement, and how quickly we can go from today’s situation to what we’ve defined as a great place to be in a robust, controlled way.’ Winning is not something this team, in its various guises, has done much of. As Aston Martin it has scored podiums but remains without a race victory, let alone a title. Its most successful eras were arguably as Racing Point, when Sergio Perez won the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, and as Jordan, when the irrepressible Eddie oversaw semi-regular flirtations with front-winning – and even title-chasing – pace. For those who remember the name Jordan above the door (not to mention Force India, Spyker, Midlands and the rest), the Stroll era feels like a very pleasant dream from which they’d really rather not wake up. ‘The old days were a lot of fun, no doubt about it,’ says Mark Gray, head of build and car assembly. ‘There were fewer races in the season but if anything we were away more; it was like going on holiday with the team. I did 18 years trackside, having joined Jordan in 2003, but what’s happening now is really exciting. Technically the cars today are incredible and Lawrence’s investment – this era – feels different. Previous owners had similar ambitions, but they weren’t necessarily realistic. Lawrence’s approach has been: “What do you need?” For us it almost required a mindset shift. No one had ever asked us that before because we didn’t have the money. Suddenly it’s like, “Right, what do we need?” And what you see here – the autoclave and five-axis CNC milling big enough to accommodate a full chassis [before the £1.2 million investment in this room-sized CNC machine, the team had to out-source the job], the wind tunnel, the gearbox department, the additive manufacturing – is the result of that. And he cares. He’s here every week and he hates it when we don’t do well. But he’s realistic too. He knows success doesn’t come overnight.’ The team’s former home is gone, its footprint buried beneath Building Two. And with its demise came the chance to create the perfect F1 facility from scratch. Previously the team operated in a state of high-functioning semi-chaos, the machining department the noisy, messy hub around which the rest of the operation grew up in an ad hoc fashion. It also had myriad storage buildings and workshops scattered across the county, not to mention a reliance on third parties for access to equipment and techniques the team couldn’t afford. Impressive on arrival, the new campus has the quiet calm of something high-performance and purpose-built, appropriately, and it feels like an Aston Martin space. Outside, the monolithic branding – divided diagonally into light and shade by the shadow of the building at noon – is both bold and beautiful. VIP parking teems with DB12s, visitors walk past a DBX on display behind reception and the hand sanitiser smells exquisite. Free-ish to roam (Mr Newey is understandably busy, the wind tunnel and sim are off-limits and if we photograph anything sensitive 1000 people will get upset), you’re struck by the light, the space and the absence of that machine-oil aroma synonymous with traditional automotive manufacturing. A wide, ground-level boulevard – The Street – runs the length of Buildings One and Two, and your direction of travel along it from reception broadly mirrors the process by which a car is created: composites, machining, quality control, inventory and assembly and, finally, the build bays. Beyond those there’s the finest gym you’ve ever seen and of course Building Three. On the first floor you’ll find offices, the biggest of which is occupied by the design team, a coffee shop, mission control (we visit ahead of the first race of the season and mission control’s already running on Australian time in anticipation) and that bleeding-edge simulator. Outside, you’re struck by the beauty of the setting – with 72,000m2 of wild meadow, 10,000m2 of immaculate lawn and more than 1500 trees, it’s easy on the eye. So, too, is almost everything you find inside. In assembly, a Brembo front brake caliper stops me in my tracks. It’s being bled on a workbench; a complicated, multi-stage process thanks to the intricacies of its internal passages. Once complete (reaching a target pressure is confirmation all the air is gone), QD couplings allow it to be packed away ready for use already pressurised, saving the race team mechanics precious time later. Machined from a single billet of titanium, its bewitching beauty is as much about the blank spaces the elaborate form frames as the metal that’s actually there. Covered in cooling vents, fins, blades and tips, there’s barely a flat surface on it. Capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 1000°C and unimaginable forces, it weighs just 2.5kg. The build bays are empty, the cars that took shape within them already in Melbourne for the first race of the reason. There, results will be mixed. Drivers Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll qualify P12 and P13. The rain-affected race is a nerve-shredder, and the kind of conditions in you’d normally back the hugely experienced Spaniard to succeed. Instead he smears his Aston down one of Albert Park’s crash-ravaged walls and into retirement, and it’s Stroll who keeps his head to claim a fine sixth place. Disappointing, perhaps, given the level the team’s striving for, but Cowell’s quick to dismiss any suggestion the team’s driver pairing is a weakness (both drivers are contracted until the end of the 2026 season – whether they’ll be in green for 2027, the season in which you get the sense the team believes it’ll be right at the sharp end, remains to be seen). Can Aston win both titles with Alonso and Stroll? ‘Yes. The challenge is making the race car quicker. When you look at the lap time we need to gain through this year in order to win races and win the championship it’s car performance, not driver.’ He’s also positive about the direction of travel.’ ‘Last year we won the championship in terms of the quantity of upgrades, but the quality of those upgrades wasn’t strong enough,’ he explains. ‘The idea generation and the confirmation of those ideas within the factory wasn’t robust enough. You end up with so much information you can easily get lost. We’ve worked to simplify that; to get down to the core things that make a race car quicker. That way we can be sure we’ve got a valuable update before we press the figurative button, releasing the surface data to manufacturing, and robustly land performance at the track. That’s the thing I would say we struggled with last year.’ While managing technical partner Newey’s focus is firmly on the new regulations and 2026, Cowell’s confident he’ll help the team more effectively turn theoretical speed into actual lap time gains almost immediately. ‘Adrian understands the whole car, and he understands the feedback from the circuit and from the drivers,’ continues Cowell. ‘I believe he will bring great value in terms of translating what the drivers are saying, translating what the car is doing, into targets within the factory. My role is to pull a business together that enables the work that Adrian wants. His experience is incredible across many different regulation sets, and his competitiveness is tremendous – undimmed, I would say. I’ve just had lunch with him in the restaurant and he’s a very friendly, very warm guy. But there were a couple of things we talked about… it’s lifting the bar, you know? Setting a new level of expectation. There’s no ambiguity there and that’s great – it’s wonderful to have.’ A big part of the reason Newey’s in Aston Martin green is the team’s wind tunnel. Just one aspect of this carefully choreographed rapid expansion overseen by chief operating officer Ben Fitzgerald. ‘I know that he saw the tunnel before it was finished, and I understand it was a key part of his decision making,’ explains Ben. ‘Lawrence introduced me [to Adrian] as the king of upgrades, though that’s the operational king, of course. My contribution is getting the upgrades to the car as quickly as possible.’ Ben joined AMF1 in January 2023, when the head count was half the circa 1000 it is now. Efficiently accommodating this swelling workforce and its demands, together with facilitating the move from a procurement-based organisation to one that now makes 70% of its cars by volume (up from 40%, a leap from 80,000 manufactured parts per year to more like 250,000, reducing external spend by 30%) is Ben’s remit, and he loves it. ‘We’re one of the most operationally effective teams on the grid, albeit that’s not being translated into performance just yet, and a lot of that is down to this campus,’ explains Fitzgerald. ‘The first of these three buildings opened in May 2023, and we produced our first parts within 24 hours. But the planning began four years before that, in mid-2019. That’s when we really established what the future of this team was going to look like, and the role this building would play in that future.’ In total, with the three buildings across the campus, AMF1’s currently at about 400,000m2, having come from a building of 50,000m2. And with £200 million invested to date, it’s not done yet. ‘We are making huge steps forward as a team, but you’ve only got to consider what else is going on – the new partnerships, another set of regulations, more insourcing – to see the challenge. We make 70% of the car, okay, but there’s still a handsome sum to go at.’ There’s much Ben’s proud of, from the rich data pouring from the team’s simulator and wind tunnel to the building’s A+ energy rating and the beehives in the grounds that surround it. But it’s what the campus says about the team he’s most happy with. ‘This is the team’s home now. When we think about the past, that wasn’t so clear cut. This is our home, and the sheer brand presence when you come to this building is fantastic. It’s an emphatic statement of intent.’ As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy. One of the team who's just as happy on two wheels as four."
153,"Performance cars? You've never had it so good, says Hyundai",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/hyundai/performance-cars/,Colin Overland,2025-07-07,Car Magazine UK,"He’s been working in the car industry for 40 years, but Hyundai’s European technical chief is no misty-eyed old sentimentalist. Tyrone Johnson, the Ford veteran who now runs the Hyundai Motor Europe Technical Centre in Germany, says the is hard to beat for sheer driving pleasure. He understands that some petrolheads are reluctant to make the change to electric, but he thinks they’ll be won over – after all, drivers have proved repeatedly that they’re happy to embrace new technology when it’s effective. And he marvelled at the breathtaking pace of progress – in 10 years, EVs had advanced as much as combustion cars in 100. In his 40 years, cars had gone from zero software to being defined by their software. ‘You can do some really clever things. In suspension, a lot is happening, with software and mechanically. It’s going to be quite interesting.’ He also noted the change in expectations: now, everyone in a car expects the journey to be a pleasant experience, not just the driver. Hot hatches still had their place, but a much larger car like the Ioniq 5 N was roomy enough to be practical and comfortable for five, while also being thrilling for the driver. Johnson, who was involved in Ford and Jaguar F1 operations, and with the Focus in WRC, said: ‘I’m a performance guy. I did the first Mustang Shelby [the 1992 SVT Mustang]. I don’t understand the idea that performance cars are dying. If you want to go fast, there’s nothing better than an EV. I don’t understand the nostalgia.’ Most combustion performance cars were, he said ‘miles away – a disappointment’ compared to the 5 N. He added: ‘I can understand that some people want to have the sounds, vibrations, things like that. Those sensory inputs help the human brain understand what’s going on in a car.’ Hence the artificial sounds piped into EVs. His role as head of the Hyundai Motor Group’s European technical centre covers not just the Hyundai brand but also Kia, Genesis and the Genesis performance sub-brand, Magma. ‘There’s been so much innovation at Rüsselsheim and some major investment. Our new building opened a couple of months ago, and it gives us so much more possibility, and allows us to develop EVs. We’re going to be developing our own products in Europe. will be developed in Europe, for the world – nothing will be developed in Korea.’ His job doesn’t just involve high-performance cars – he’s also responsible for teams exploring passenger-orientated innovations. ‘You mustn’t forget that a car is a commodity, and people will buy it for a lot of reasons, whether that’s its performance or because it has built-in shoe sanitisers. In 40 years there have been a lot of changes. I remember the old guys saying things like ABS and ESP would never make it. Maybe in 20 years you won’t be able to buy a car without shoe sanitisers, if the market feels that need.

154,Omoda eyes up UK R&D centre,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/omoda/rd-centre-in-the-uk/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-07-07,Car Magazine UK,"Chery Automotive’s plans for the UK are already in full swing, but there’s much more in the pipeline. Alongside a spate of new models from both its Jaecoo and Omoda brand, the Chinese powerhouse is also eyeing up a UK-based R&D centre. The reason? For the sole purpose of better understanding and courting the tough, discerning UK car market. ‘We do a lot of research on customer feedback,’ Victor Zhang, vice president of Jaecoo and Omoda UK told me at the launch of its new . ‘And the biggest reason people choose to buy an is people love the design.’ Omoda is therefore following the data, and extending the same design language to its larger, more premium Omoda 9 flagship. Larger but similarly understated, it looks every bit a larger sibling to the 5. At the same time, Omoda is also upholding its ethos of giving as much tech as possible for the money, though Zhang tells me the E5 scores well in other aspects such as driving. That aspect feels a little harder to believe, given our experience with the current spec. Indeed, not all the feedback has been good and Omoda is already in the process of implementing MY updates for its 5 and E5 SUVs. For example, the suspension of the E5 will be tweaked for next year, as two decades of Chery’s research never fully uncovered the horror of our roads. The ICE-powered 5 will also receive some changes, based again on both reviews and customer feedback. The best way to accelerate the feedback loop is to put boots on the ground, and that’s exactly what Omoda is considering net. In addition to the 60-strong dealership network the brand launched with in the UK, Omoda will also look to increase its British presence before the point of sale. Chery Automotive wants to do R&D here too. ‘We have R&D capacity in Spain, Barcelona, but for the UK, we are considering the same,’ Zhang confirmed to me. ‘[A hub] crucial to better understand the local requirements and needs of the customers.’ The move is a sign that Chery is here to stay here, but it also reveals the extent the company will go to when cracking the UK market.  Will it work? We’ll partly find out next year, when we drive the updated Omoda cars. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

155,Kia EV5 revealed: the mid-sized EV for the masses,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/kia-ev5/,Ryan Gilmore,2025-07-08,Car Magazine UK,"Nobody could accuse Kia of having a quiet 2025. On top of a stonking refresh, it’s introduced the and is readying the . But now there’s even more, the new Kia EV5. It’s Kia’s all-electric answer to its best-selling Sportage, and it’s set to land in the UK before the year is out. It slots between the EV4 and the EV6 and sits on the group’s E-GMP electric platform, the same hardware you’ll find underpinning the other ‘EV followed by a number’ Kias. It can trace its roots back to the EV5 concept of 2023, unveiled at the same time as the EV3 and EV4. And while the EV5 has been available in China and the land down under for some time, there have been some substantial changes to ready the car for Europe and the UK. You’d be right, EV5 bound for the UK looks identical to the Kia EV5 currently sold in China, but there’s more. Unlike with Hyundai’s – admittedly cool – laissez-faire approach, Kia has a very cohesive language for the brand’s EVs. There’s almost a Russian-doll likeness to the range, all stemming from the boxlike . Those side profile unmistakably take inspiration from it, with its boxy silhouette, high roofline and squared-off wings. The front meanwhile has more than a whiff of EV3 about it with Kia’s ‘Tiger Face’ design and ‘Star Map’ headlights clear as day. Again, think shrunken EV9 or expanded EV3. The dashboard with its disguised air vents, haptic controls and four-spoke wheel is clear-cut EV9. It also sports the rather pointless toggleable HVAC control screen seen in the EV3. The EV5 for China features a front bench seat a la ‘60s Cadillac Eldorado, the EV5 destined for Europe sprouts a centre console and two individual front seats. Interior space is a stand-out. The boot is a chunky 566 litres of boot space, swelling to 1,650 litres with the rear seats folded completely flat. And as if that wasn’t enough, there’s even a 44-litre frunk for storing the charging cable. This is perhaps the largest difference between an EV5 destined for the UK and one for China – battery chemistry. While Chinese examples use LFP (lithium iron phosphate), we’ll be getting NMC (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides). To cut out a GCSE Chemistry lesson, the batteries for Europe and the UK will be lighter and easier to charge in the winter but cost more to produce. While not homologated yet, the 81.4kWh battery is estimated to offer a range of 329 miles. All examples will be front-wheel drive, offer 214bhp and have a top speed of 102mph. Vehicle-to-load (V2L) charging is included as standard and there’s a three-pin plug in the interior from which you can run fridges, TVs and even charge another car. Meanwhile, entertainment packages will be offered, allowing for premium subscriptions to Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and some mildly addictive casual games from the main infotainment screen. And good news for cats and dogs, this is the first Kia to offer a pet mode. They can expect constant air con, locked doors and interfaces to avoid and paw-related mishaps, as well as a polite message on the dashboard to notify passers by that all is okay. Kia is yet to announce UK pricing for the EV5 but expect the entry level model to slot between the EV4 and EV6. Kia estimate pricing will start at just over £38,000, while the range-topping GT-Line S will come in at the £45,000 ballpark. CAR also understands that there is a faster EV5 GT in the works, but no word on when that may arrive, or the specs.

156,Bentley EXP 15 revealed: a very distant look at its first electric car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bentley/exp-15/,Ted Welford,2025-07-08,Car Magazine UK,"Just when you thought was the most controversial concept car of the last 12 months, Bentley comes along with this – the EXP 15, a ‘luxury vision concept’ that will help to showcase its first EV due to launch in 2027. Drawing inspiration from Bentley’s 1930s ‘Blue Train’, it’s the first car designed under the watchful eye of the firm’s relatively new design director Robin Page. He has definitely made his mark, twisting the classic lines of recent Bentleys to create what is possibly its boldest and bravest car in decades, and deliberately so. It’s frankly impossible not to discuss that grille. Crewe’s models have not exactly been known for their subtlety, but the big, brash rectangle that is the EXP 15’s front nose is the centre point. EVs don’t need grilles, and it’s a design element that manufacturers continue to struggle with. With the EXP 15, Bentley calls the EXP 15’s front an ‘iconic grille’, and says that despite the transition to an EV, it’s important to the ‘brand’s historic vehicle architecture’. and specifically one of its most famed models, the 1930 Bentley Speed Six, nicknamed the ‘Blue Train’. Robin Page said: ‘Grilles used to be all about getting air to the combustion engine through the front of the car. But now, with light technology changing, we have an opportunity to create a piece of digital art. So the grille stays as our iconic front.’ It’s not the only detail that is inspired by the Blue Train, with the long bonnet and rearward cabin also shared. The sloping rooflines of the two cars aren’t too dissimilar, either. The Blue Train is the nickname for the 1930 Bentley Speed Six Gurney Nutting Sportsman coupe, which gets its name from a race where then-chairman Woolf Barnato raced against a blue express train from Cannes to Calais. The story goes that Barnato and his Bentley arrived in London before the train had even got to the north of France. The EXP 15’s rear is undoubtedly prettier than its front, with huge wraparound C-shaped lights, while there are twin active spoilers that deploy from the end of the car’s sloping roofline. Active aero also appears with lower sections of the car at the front and rear able to open and close, all done in the name of maximising the electric driving range. Did three seats pique your interest? Well, you’re not alone. But it’s not like a van, nor a in a seating arrangement, but rather a ‘1+2’ layout, which Bentley says ‘affords greater luxury’. We’ve all seen the S-Class’s and 7 Series’ of this world travelling around with the front passenger seat flung as far forward as possible to enable more legroom for those in the back, so it makes perfect sense. Worth noting that the ‘Blue Train’ also had three seats. Twin coach doors and part of the panoramic roof also open upwards to make it easier to get in and out of, while the rear seat on the passenger side swivels. ‘The seat can rotate and you step out totally unflustered, not trying to clamber out of the car like you see with some supercars,’ said Darren Day, head of interior design at Bentley. ‘You just get out with dignity and the Instagram shot is perfect. If you look at the car we built for Her Majesty the Queen, it was always designed around the aperture of the door and ‘the art of arrival’. So there you have it, as suitable for royalty as it is an influencer in Monaco. The passenger side seat can also be slid into a more normal ‘co-pilot’ position and also reclined fully in ‘Relax’ mode. There’s storage for, I quote, treasured pets to sit where a normal passenger seat would be, and the boot doubles up as ‘upmarket picnic seating’ with two small seats deployed alongside a fridge suitable for cooling your champagne. Perfect for the polo. Bentley shot into the headlines last week with the reveal of its , and the EXP 15 is the first time we’re seeing it on one of its cars. Only the fifth design of its famous B in its 106-year history, the redesign was also led by Page, and all the branding is done in-house – a rarity for carmakers. The Bentley wings are now sharper and more angular, while the ‘tail feathers’ underneath the B have been removed entirely. Bentley says the logo now looks more like a peregrine falcon, rather than a barn owl it did previously. While this is a design concept, there is tech on it that you can expect to see on a future production Bentley. A fusion of physical and digital features is expected on Bentley’s first EV, channelling the likes of Bentley’s existing rotating dashboard, which alters from a split dashboard when the touchscreen isn’t required. The EXP 15’s full-width dashboard can be used for various infotainment features or turned off completely to show a veneered wood surface beneath the glass. Page said: ‘We think people are going to get fed up with a fully digital experience and are pining for physical mechanical elements too. By combining the two, you get the best of both worlds. It’s almost like wearing a beautiful watch on one wrist and a digital watch on the other.’ Bentley says it has conceived the EXP 15 as having an ‘electric, all-wheel-drive powertrain with a long range and recharging speeds commensurate with the convenience customers have come to expect of a Bentley’. The saloon market isn’t what it once was. We know that, and so does Bentley – it stopped its Mulsanne a few years ago, and the Flying Spur mainly sells to the Chinese market. The EXP 15 explores what a future Bentley saloon might look like, with a raised body shape that channels the SUV ride height without looking like one. Don’t expect this to appear on Bentley’s first EV, though. We’ve already seen the silhouette of its ‘urban SUV’, which shows a more boxy profile than the lower, sleeker lines of this concept.

185,Why Adrian Newey said no to a Ferrari superteam,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/aston-martin/adrian-newey/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-09-11,Car Magazine UK,"Adrian Newey has joined Aston Martin as a managing technical partner and shareholder in a deal that’s reportedly worth around £30 million a year. The move was announced in a press conference at Aston Martin’s brand-new, state-of-the-art factory, but we could’ve easily been in Maranello, not Milton Keynes. ‘I was very flattered by the number of teams that did approach me,’ said Newey of the period after his Red Bull resignation. ‘I had discussions with some of those teams, but in the end, it became a very clear and natural choice.’  For the last few months, Ferrari was widely reported as being at the front of that list, with reports suggesting Newey would join Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc to form a super team from 2025 onwards. That makes Newey’s signature a huge statement of intent from Lawrence Stroll, but also something of a loss for the Scuderia. ‘Next to Ferrari, Aston Martin is the most iconic brand across the world,’ Newey admitted yesterday’s press conference. So, what made him pick green over red? The reasons are complex, intertwined and only really known to the man himself and his wife Amanda – a key part in his decision making. Earlier this year, reports from Italy suggested that Ferrari didn’t’ want to get into a ‘bidding war’ with Stroll, but that appears to be something of a red herring. After all, Ferrari is no stranger to handing out huge contracts in its pursuit of championships. Just look at its most recent driver signing. Instead, comments from Newey at yesterday’s event painted a different picture. Lawrence Stroll was present throughout the announcement, and it’s clear his personality – above his resources – was a key factor for Newey. ‘Lawrence’s passion, commitment and enthusiasm is very endearing – it’s very persuasive,’ said Newey at yesterday’s press conference. We’d agree. Stroll may have looked the epitome of a pinstriped, business mogul, but what he’s assembled in the last few years – and hours – proves he’s a racer. It also more evidence of his desire to make Aston a match for Ferrari, both on and off the track. Newey and Stroll may have been in the spotlight, but a look in the audience revealed the true depth of the Aston Martin organisation in 2024. It can count ex-McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh, and ex-Mercedes High Performance Powertrains wizard Andy Cowell in its ranks – as well as ex-Ferrari chief brand and commercial officer, Marco Mattiacci. Then there’s ex-Newey acolyte Dan Fallows in the design team; one of the people responsible for Aston’s strong start to 2022. ‘There’s been many pieces in the puzzle, from when we started six years ago, to our great management team we have today,’ Stroll said. ‘Adrian is key – the biggest part of the puzzle, certainly from a technical point of view, from a technical leadership point of view. He will be leading the team, and I think that will have a trickle-down effect to the whole organization.’ Aston Martin’s impressive infrastructure will certainly have been a key reason for the signing. We look at the newly opened building two after the event, and it’s an extension of everything you’d expect from a modern F1 facility. It follows building one, opened officially in May of last year, and will be followed by building three in a matter of weeks. Ferrari may well have excellent facilities, but Aston Martin’s are fresh, and have been built from the ground up for modern F1 – and they have the bonus (for Newey) of being in England, too. ‘It’s not an easy thing to do to build a brand-new factory and greenfield site and have it have a really nice, warm, creative feel to it,’ said Newey. ‘I’ve seen some new buildings that haven’t quite fulfilled that. But this one has a great feel, the portions are right. It has all the facilities.’ Outside the building Aston Martin can also count on Aramco and Honda, the latter with whom Newey has already won championships in the past. ‘There’s no better partnership in the world than what we have with the Aramco,’ said Stroll. ‘And to be able to bring Honda exclusively to work for us for the next five years after the [new] regulations start, where partners are also tremendously important’ Newey’s decision-making process will have also been influenced by the unique grasp Stroll holds over his team. Very new and businesslike on the surface, it also harks to the days of active team owners such as Frank Williams, Ron Dennis and Ken Tyrell – people Newey has worked for and against. ‘In this modern era, Lawrence is unique in being the only properly active team owner,’ said Newey later on at the event. ‘It’s a different feeling when you have somebody that’s involved like that. It’s back to the old-school model.’ Newey appears to answer questions transparently at the best of times (letting slip the inner workings of Red Bull and an aborted move from Alonso to the team) but here it felt like he was really getting to the heart of his decision. Unlike Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur, Stroll holds all the chips when it comes to Aston Martin – and has billions of dollars’ worth of skin in the game. That could be well one of the reasons why he was able to easily offer a shareholder option, something Newey said hasn’t been offered to him before. ‘I think one of the things that I always think is he has total belief,’ said Newey of the Aston owner. ‘He has a direction. He’s happy to put all his chips on the black. And that’s what he’s doing here.’ When Michael Schumacher joined Ferrari in 1996, he created a template the sport’s most successful drivers have followed ever since; join a mid-table F1 outfit, build the team around you, and make sure you’re number one. Newey is doing something different; joining a newly-formed – but mid-table – powerhouse and sitting atop it as a final missing piece. But Newey can’t bring new drivers with him in the way Schumacher brought technical bods. He’ll be working with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll – two seats that have become hugely coveted with a few strokes of a designer’s pen. And if Lance was under pressure before, he’ll be under even more scrutiny in a Newey-designed car. In the driver area, then, it’d be fair to say Ferrari has the stronger suit – though it’ll need to make a more consistent car than it has for the last five years. Newey feels no external pressure to win – he says that comes from within – but he’ll be targeting 2026 and the new regulations rather than 2025. Ferrari will be well placed for the former, as well as other works teams such as Mercedes, but Aston’s exclusive relationship with Honda and the introduction of Newey will hold it in good stead. ‘It’ll be a case of getting myself up to speed as quickly as possible, and just as importantly, getting to know everybody here, learning how to work with everybody, and how we all get the best out of each other. That’s what it’s all about,’ said Newey. ‘Yes, of course they are an opportunity,’ he added of the 2026 rules. ‘They’ll be a reset for everybody. Whether we’ll be able to capitalize on that or not, we just don’t know.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

186,Theory 1: Lotus EV supercar concept is a carbonfibre crystal ball,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lotus/theory-1/,Jake Groves,2024-09-17,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Lotus Theory 1 – a wild new concept car showing off the future of the brand’s design, material use and technology. Is this the closest thing we’ve seen to Lotus creating a sports car? It will be, at least before launches. The brand is very keen to point out that this new concept car isn’t a precursor to that, with it being the first of a more free-thinking series of ‘Theory’ concept cars. ‘Something will only get a type number when it’s been fully approved for production,’ says Ben Payne, Lotus Group’s vice president for design; ‘this is a different kind of exercise.’ You can read our . The exercise is to push Lotus forward into the next dimension and show off the brand’s ‘core design principles’: Digital, Natural and Analogue. Lotus says it’s aiming to be ‘a global performance brand by 2028,’ and elements of this car, and all future Theory concepts, will help to shape its future vehicles – regardless of whether they’re sports cars or ‘lifestyle’ vehicles like and . Sure. Payne says he was personally, and rather heavily, inspired by the original Esprit. ‘My first memory of anything to do with Lotus is the S1 Esprit – I’m of the right age to be easily influenced by such a thing! But watching that drive out of the sea in a Bond movie, and someone telling me it’s a Lotus – that was it. ‘Think of how progressive the S1 was when it launched in 1975 – cars of that period really pushed the boundaries and the positivity of the time.’ That’s arguably why the Theory 1 is about as wedge-shaped as a concept car can be. It’s low to the ground, sleek with very few creases or visual trinkets to the shape and visually sits very wide. Colour is played around with, splitting the car in half with a thin digital display that acts as an interaction tool incorporated into the doors. At the front, the Theory 1 uses something called laser wire from Kyocera in its headlight designs, where the brand’s modern light signature is incorporated using razor thin pieces of wire suspended and stretched taut. Using laser wire is like using fibre optics, but the entire wire glows with light rather than just the ends. Not needing loads of individual fibre optics, let alone much heavier and complex LED daytime running light formations, is good for weight saving without a loss of functionality. The doors open upwards, but Lotus has decided to keep many of the door’s mechanisms exposed meaning large arms that were inset into the roof look as if they are lifting the doors up. It’s all very technical, but well integrated. And that’s the overall vibe Payne and his team have been going for. He’s keen to showcase some of Lotus’ old strengths of lightness, the smart use of materials and the exposure of engineering. So much so that, if you look through the enormous opening underneath the rear wing/air brake integrated into tail, you’ll see the car’s pushrod suspension struts, axle beams and electric motor. But, given it’s the 21 century and Lotus is a car company moving with the times, modern details include that digital light bar in the doors and a lidar sensors incorporated into the design. In fact, the lidar equipment at the front raises up ‘like pop-up headlights used to,’ smiles Payne. Very much, so. And what you’ll notice first is that it’s a three-seater; a driving position that Payne says is ‘as close as you can get to driving a Formula One car. ‘For a product designed for drivers, it instills and builds and inspires confidence. From a weight distribution point of view, you can’t get any better.’ You climb into a cockpit that’s surrounded by recycled chop carbonfibre, giving the lower ‘tub’ a sort of camouflage-like pattern. The seats are built into the tub, with thin pads and extremely intricate, 3D-printed headrests giving you plenty of comfort while keeping things as light as possible. Those headrests include individual speakers in them, which include active noise cancelling that allows each of the three occupants to be listening to individual media without the others hearing. The seats are filled with small pads that inflate within a second from a brand called MotorSkins, giving them texture and grip. ‘We had this idea of including a lot of haptic communication,’ says Payne, ‘giving you something that’s very intuitive and gives you feedback to your driving situation without looking at a screen.’ So much so that Payne envisions driver assistance technologies being linked to the pads so you feel changes to the road around you rather than be shouted at by bongs or flashed at by distracting visual stimuli. The steering wheel itself is bare bones and almost yoke-like in design. The grabhandles feature those haptic pads, too, and robust metallic paddles that feel wonderfully tactile in your hands. The car does have screens, but one is in-built into the lower edge of the windscreen – something you don’t notice until it turns on – and the only others are the glass displays for the digital camera mirrors. Well, Lotus says this really is just a concept car. And yet there are some targeted performance figures ready for it, as the brand demonstrates how close a lot of the technology on board is to production readiness. Theory 1, then, features a 70kWh battery pack, all-wheel drive electric power of circa-1000 metric horsepower (986bhp) and an estimated WLTP range of around 250 miles. Use of all those lightweight materials means Lotus is ‘targeting’ a weight figure of around 1600kg. Still heavy by Lotus’s sub-tonne Elise standards but, with a claimed 2.5-ish-second 0-62mph sprint time, it’s comparable to the Evija for performance. On top of that, Lotus says there are five drive modes – Range, Tour, Sport, Individual and Track, like its production cars – and a 360-degree driver assistance suite that allows for Level 4 autonomous driving. Pirelli P Zero Elect tyres are fitted, as are next-generation AP Racing brakes. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

187,‘Our brand must work globally’: Lotus design boss talks new product push and weight-reduction,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lotus/ben-payne/,Guy Bird,2024-09-17,Car Magazine UK,"There was an interesting slide projected at a recent Lotus press briefing ahead of its proposed IPO listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It reiterated the British brand’s well-publicised ‘all electric from now on’ product introductions and latest delivery schedules, it also gave some extremely ambitious sales estimates and pricing information. Lotus wants to sell 5000-6000 combustion sports cars in 2024. And 40,000-50,000 £89,500-plus per year from 2026. Plus 30,000-40,000 similarly-priced , and a whopping 80,000-90,000 £55k-plus mid-sized SUVs (Type 134) a year from 2027. Add in 10,000-15,000 annual sales of the Type 135 sports car at circa £75,000, plus the odd £2m-ish Evija hypercar, and the annual total could top 200,000 units and a lot of revenue. By comparison, Porsche sold 320,221 cars in 2023. Given that Lotus sales were under 1000 in 2022, that’s a monumental ramp-up. All of which makes new Lotus Group design VP Ben Payne’s job an increasingly large and complex one. The 45-year-old took on the top job in August 2023, just months after the untimely death at 73 of his former boss, the veteran Peter Horbury. ‘The strategy was set regarding future products,’ Payne says. ‘Peter contributed to them, so his legacy will be felt for quite a few years.’ Payne was already chief creative officer of the Lotus Tech Creative Centre in Coventry by 2022 (overseeing the non-sports car side of the range) and boasts a long career to date. The Royal College of Art graduate has worked at Bugatti (2009 16C Galibier concept), Aston Martin (2016 DB11) and for numerous global car brands during two stints at design agency Makkina. He joined Lotus owner Geely in 2018. He’s keenly aware of the leap ahead. ‘We have to shape the brand so it works everywhere,’ he says. ‘Our 2022 sales figures were some 600 cars, and now we’re getting on for 19,000 orders. Those customers are very different, but we’ve got to not leave people behind. As we start to release smaller vehicles, maybe they will be easier for that [existing] audience to accept. “Lighter and tighter” technological products are a brand-level aspiration. But it’s driven by what we can offer customers at the right price point. You can make smaller, more tightly-packed, higher-tech cars – but they are expensive.’ Payne is alluding to the next two smaller Lotus EVs. First up is the Type 134 mid-sized SUV, due to be unveiled later in 2024 and take on the newly-electric Porsche Macan in showrooms by 2026, and second, the Type 135 two-seat sports car to be revealed in 2025 and on sale 2027. ‘When you’re stretching the brand most people know from the Elise, the Eletre is a big transition,’ he continues. ‘But we’ve got more freedom with the Type 134.’ So, no mini-me Eletre then? ‘I think as we take what the brand represents – that real pioneering spirit – you can expect more of a statement.’ Sounds promising. Payne also keeps an eye on every area a Lotus logo touches. For starters, I half-jokingly suggest he takes a look at the London showroom’s weirdly black loo paper and narrow downlighting in the rest rooms. ‘Designers sometimes get too into the details, trying to harmonise things and be consistent,’ he concedes. ‘Otherwise people can run too fast and the brand becomes diluted. But, note to self, “sort the toilets out”…’ More seriously, he reports directly to Lotus CEO Qingfeng Feng and is acutely aware of the increased weight of the Lotus EV line-up at odds with its founder Colin Chapman’s famous ‘simplify, then add lightness’ mantra. ‘Weight is a massively important factor in vehicle efficiency so just saying “I’m an EV and I’m green” doesn’t tick all the boxes. You need to be heading towards circularity, in the way you design and create as the product goes through its lifecycle. That is the aspiration everyone needs to chase and that will be driven by certain markets quicker than others. ‘The second part of the equation is brand value. What’s the right thing for Lotus to do? To make cars which are as efficient as possible in any segment. That comes back to materials and manufacturing.

188,Renault revives the Estafette van for a funkier electric urban delivery future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/estafette-concept/,CJ Hubbard,2024-09-17,Car Magazine UK,"Europe’s biggest commercial vehicle show is happening right now – the IAA in Germany – and in among the worthy, heading-for-an-industrial-estate-near-you production fodder, Renault has sprung a surprise with this new Estafette 4.0 concept. If you’re not up on your van history (for shame, etc), the original Renault Estafette was a bit of a gamechanger when it was introduced in 1959. Front-engined and front-wheel drive, it brought an improved level of space efficiency to the burgeoning mid-size van market. Now Renault is hoping to pull off a similar trick to improve the space efficiency of small, urban-friendly electric vans. For the new Renault Estafette Concept doesn’t just look cute, it’s also rather clever. And, we’re told, heading for production ‘in two years’ time’. Small electric vans make a lot of sense for city deliveries – zero emissions combined with nippy performance and compact size is great for darting about and getting stuff to peoples’ doorsteps. But if the van is so small you need to send two, then a bigger van is more economically viable… until that bigger van isn’t nimble enough to get the job done without, perhaps, risking increased levels of in-service damage. With the Estafette Concept, Renault has approached saving this by creating a vehicle with a footprint similar to a long-wheelbase , the firm’s current small van. At under 5m in length and 2m width, the Estafette will still fit into most ordinary parking spaces and has a turning circle similar to a . But thanks to a dramatically increased roof height, it has load space equivalent to a short-wheelbase, high-roof – Renault’s present competitor to the . For comparison, the Estafette is 2.59m tall versus the Kangoo’s 1.84m. In fact, it’s around 60cm taller than most Transit Customs and you see on the road. This would create a rather gawky visual impact if Renault hadn’t played it by painting the top part bright yellow and giving it that endearing little bulldog face. All part of an effort to make vans more interesting, too. The inside has been thoroughly thought-through, too. The height of the roof means drivers up to 1.9m tall (that’s about 6ft 2in) will be able to stand up in the cab and access the load space via a sliding door in the bulkhead. This improves safety, because it means the driver never has to go to the rear of the van – they simply select what they need and exit onto the pavement via the sliding side doors. The bulkhead door automatically locks as you exit the vehicle to protect the load compartment, while the side doors have ‘pocket sliding’ design that is said to reduce wrist strain. A swivelling seat – just one, the fold-down second seat is ‘only for training’ – also improves the ergonomics of getting up and into the load area, where a number of folding shelves help organise the contents. Loading the van is done by a roller shutter at the rear. Because this doesn’t open outwards like conventional barn-doors or tailgates, the Estafette concept can be backed right up to a loading dock – though a set of steps is available for rear access if necessary. Theory goes that the driver will never need to access the back during their rounds; so it’s loading through the rear, unloading at the side, all in the name of added safety and security. A massive ‘triptych-shaped’ windscreen improves forward visibility, while the rear view is taken care of by cameras and screens. Of which there are plenty in the cabin. The Estafette Concept is the first demonstration of a new FlexEVan platform, codeveloped by Renault and its Flexis partners – that’s Volvo and logistics company CMA-CGM. There’s no info yet about performance, power/torque output or driving range, but this will make use of a new SDV electronic architecture. SDV stands for Software-Defined Vehicle, and has been developed by Renault’s specialist ‘intelligent electric vehicles’ arm, Ampere. SDV is modular, scalable, connected and updateable – and probably plenty of other buzzwords as well. At its essence it plans to provide a permanent cloud connection for the electronics onboard, allowing them to improve over time. The modular aspect is intended to make it easier to add power hungry conversion types to the basic platform, such as freezer compartments, specialist lighting rigs and other developments beyond the norm of simple ‘van’. Sounds cool. Here’s hoping the production version keeps the things just as funky. Ultimately, the Estafette, or the production version it becomes, will be Renault’s new medium van, or the replacement for the Trafic. When asked if the production version would sit alongside the brand’s existing vans, or be a replacement for any, Renault’s vice president for global sales and marketing commercial vehicles Zak Zeghari said: ‘It doesn’t make sense to keep to keep an electric medium van like Trafic [E-Tech] electric. So when will we bring, I would say, the Estafette project, or the other shapes then that will be our solution for the medium van segment.’ This means that the Trafic E-Tech is only set to be on sale for around two more years, given the production Estafette is due to arrive in 2026. As the diesel Trafic won’t be offered in the UK from 2030 onwards thanks to the phasing out of internal combustion engines, this means that the Estafette will be Renault’s only mid-size van offer from as soon as six years time.

189,"Online car sales: Care by Volvo service to stop in UK, split in Europe",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/online-car-sales/,Jake Groves,2024-09-17,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo has begun the process of winding down its Care By Volvo service. In a statement on 16 September 2024, Volvo said: ‘Volvo Cars has begun the process of reviewing its in-house leasing operations in certain markets in Europe and to transfer active contracts to new partners with the aim of ensuring a seamless changeover of finance providers. The decision to move away from in-house leasing to a partner-based set-up is to ensure we are providing products that suit customers’ needs, while at the same time ensuring we are allocating resources towards further digitising our whole business.’ The service has been seen as a novel part of a wider trend regarding buying your car online. Many car makers and businesses in the industry allow you to purchase a new or used car without ever needing to venture into a dealer or showroom. Volvo’s Care by Volvo scheme, an in-house ‘subscription’ service that bundled ownership of the car, servicing and more besides will be closed in the UK and US, or transferred to external partners in countries like Germany and the brand’s home market of Sweden. The subscription was seen as a pioneering addition to the process of buying a car online, with the brand having hoped to shake up the market with its idea of treating your new car more like taking out a phone contract. The brand’s Care By Volvo service had no deposit or balloon payment at the end of a term, but meant a pretty hefty monthly fee to make up for it. However, the scheme didn’t seem like a massive success. A spokesperson for the brand told CAR in December 2023 that it sold ‘over 12,000’ cars via Care by Volvo since it was introduced in the UK in September 2020. That’s a relatively low proportion given it sold around 50,000 cars in the UK in 2023 alone. As the services closes in the UK and is to be handled externally in European markets, Volvo says that it will continue to sell its cars via a digital storefront and offer traditional financing options via loans or leasing arrangements instead. It means more control for the car maker on price, and a more direct way of reaching out to the consumer. Buying a car online is billed as being quick and easy – and allows customers to avoid pushy salespeople. As well as offering digital storefronts that allow you to configure your new car and order it from your computer or phone, some even offer additional services like direct delivery and collections (including collections for servicing, in some cases). ‘It’s a very digital offer,’ Björn Annwall, Volvo’s chief commercial officer, told CAR in 2023. He says one big weakness with the traditional approach is the likelihood that a car in the right spec will be in the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘Here it gets shipped directly to you when you order it.’ When Genesis – the Korean luxury car brand – , it originally didn’t rely on dealership locations spread in high-population areas like many other car makers. Instead, it used ‘studios’ in urban locations (there were originally two Genesis Studios in London and one in Edinburgh for its UK business), with every other part of the buying and aftersales process service being performed remotely. Polestar, too, follows a similar model. Some buyers still want the tactility of looking at their next car up close ‘in the metal’, and even some of the manufacturers who’ve implemented online buying know there are limits. Back in the middle of 2023, an industry insider told CAR: ‘I’ve done the online stuff and the shopping malls, but it keeps reverting [to traditional dealerships] when all the hype has cut through. Look at Genesis, for example: they’ve recently announced they’re looking for retail partners, because they’ve reached a point where the online stuff can’t work any more. ‘Most of these models appear to work in the short term, but if you look back over the last three or four years, they’ve then morphed back into a traditional model much more quietly. All of a sudden, you realise that you’re selling around 60 to 70 per cent of your cars the same way as everybody else.’ And it’s true: Genesis’ chief brand officer Graeme Russell admitted earlier in 2023: ‘I think our larger markets, like Germany or the UK, will need an evolution of that model. Working with agency partners [i.e. more physical locations, but where the brand directly controls pricing and inventory] is a recognition that in order to achieve the potential of getting a brand to scale, we need to find the right partners.’ And that was the plan, in order to shift more units in its fledgeling European markets. Seven partners for the UK were initially located by June of 2023. But, by the end of 2023, it wasn’t enough for the brand in the UK market. Genesis’ UK operations as a separate entity have been wound down as the brand changes its business strategy; the brand will still sell cars in the UK, but via Hyundai dealerships as the restructured business is absorbed into Hyundai Motor UK as of 2024. Volvo acknowledges buying a car online isn’t for everyone, and nor are subscriptions. Some customers still need that touchy-feely experience, and the company still needs locations for aftersales services and maintenance. ‘The need for a physical infrastructure is still there – you can’t stream a car – but over time it will be reduced,’ Annwall told CAR in 2023. While other manufacturers are almost entirely abandoning the idea. ‘Mainstream customers want to buy – and I want to underline this – want to buy a car in a dealership,’ says Luca De Meo (pictured above), boss of Groupe Renault, speaking during the Group’s Ampere Capital Markets Day in November 2023 and emphasising the point while discussing Renault’s growing range of EVs. ’70 per cent of them, according to our research, want to do that – against only around 30 per cent for early EV adopters. That’s where the Renault network in Europe takes the stage with its 4800 dealerships and 8000-strong service points, as well as 30,000 EV-trained technicians. This isn’t something a fancy website can replace.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

190,Opinion: 'Why I think road pricing won't work in the UK',https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/road-pricing/,Keith WR Jones,2024-09-18,Car Magazine UK,"Rumours have been swirling over the last few weeks that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is going to announce the introduction of a road pricing scheme in the upcoming Autumn Statement. But why would such a scheme be necessary, how would it even work, and how likely is it to actually happen? A lot of reporting on the rumours has suggested that road pricing will be introduced to help fill the £22 billion ‘black hole’ the Labour government found in the country’s finances after the election. But that’s not the case, certainly not the one that would be presented. Motoring taxes are supposed to be ring-fenced for road building and maintenance. In reality, that’s not really the case, but it’s the political justification. The only political case that could be made for road pricing – i.e. how it would be justified to the public – is around the issue of electric cars (EVs) currently being exempt from annual vehicle excise duty (VED) charges. The exchequer loses out on a lot of money as a result, and the situation would only get worse as more EVs hit the road. However, the reporting on road pricing has missed a crucial point – brand new EVs will be liable for VED from 1 April 2025. The exact charges that will be levied haven’t been announced yet, but all EVs will be lifted into the lowest cost bracket for cars of their age. According to the Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), that will add around £1 billion per year to the £7.3 billion already raised from VED on non-zero-emission cars. Does that negate the need for road pricing on its own? Not necessarily. EV uptake is well behind early projections – the OBR expected fully half of all new cars to be EVs by 2025, but they currently account for less than a fifth. So that prediction of an extra billion being raised may be rather overoptimistic. And we have no idea how the volume of new car sales will evolve as we get closer to the ban on new petrol and diesel cars. That’s being brought forward to 2030, though hybrids will still be on sale until 2035. It’s entirely possible that people will hang onto their existing petrol and diesel cars a lot longer, reducing the number of new EVs sold. And that could lead to the take from VED shrinking again. Then there’s the issue of the tax paid on fuel. 53p in fuel duty is added to the actual cost of the fuel, then there’s 20% VAT on top of that. The fuel duty alone is expected to raise £24.7 billion in 2023-24, plus whatever the VAT raises. EV owners do pay VAT on the electricity they put in their cars – 5% at home and 20% at public chargers. But that wouldn’t come close to replacing the money raised by fuel duty even as the number of EVs on the road increases. Personally, I think we are going to see fewer new cars hit the road every year once we’re past the bans on the various types of petrol and diesel vehicles. If it even happens – I have my doubts, but that’s another story. The fact remains that the UK’s vehicle fleet is evolving quicker than ever before and it’s already causing financial headaches for the government that could become aneurysms if the way vehicles and driving are taxed doesn’t change. Which brings us to road pricing – or pay-per-mile, as it’s often called. Let me be clear that I’m only offering a personal opinion based on my knowledge of how governments operate and what would work politically. There are several ways it could be done. The fear-mongers would have you believe the only way it could be done is what I’ll call the maximalist approach. That would involve a grid of cameras covering every inch of the UK road network. Each car would be tracked along all its journeys and the driver sent a bill periodically. That’s never going to happen. Building the infrastructure and systems needed would cost tens, even hundreds of billions. Even if the project went completely smoothly (what are the chances of that happening?) it could take decades for the scheme to pay for itself and start actually contributing to the country’s coffers. The maximalist scheme could also be achieved by in-car monitors. But that would still be massively expensive to set up and administer. If it wasn’t killed in the courts on data protection and privacy grounds. Which it would be. Singapore runs a related pay-per-mile system. It’s not dissimilar to Dart Charge or France’s Liber-t toll road schemes. Gantries are placed over key roads and every car has an electronic tag. Cars are checked into and out of the roads, and the charge deducted from the driver’s account. It’s a fine idea that might work on certain roads in the UK. But a widespread scheme would have the same problems as the maximalist approach, and a limited scheme would only displace traffic onto roads that aren’t charged. There are, of course, many other ways of charging drivers for the mileage they cover that require much less up-front investment. New Zealand, for instance, charges drivers per 1000km driven – $76 (£36) per 1000km for cars. A similar scheme could be implemented in the UK based on the mileage covered between MOTs. It would be comparatively easy to set up and administer, and would ensure every driver is charged a fair rate for the miles they cover. But the rates would have to be set at a relatively low level to avoid a damaging political backlash, especially from the haulage industry. And it would almost certainly lead to an epidemic of clocking – people winding back the mileage on their car to avoid paying what they should. Changing cars frequently could also get around it. But there are models that could be a suitable alternative to road/mileage pricing. In the USA, vehicle owners pay an annual (sometimes astronomical) registration fee set by the state they live in. The Dutch equivalent of VED is based on weight. In France, they pay no VED but fuel duty is higher and there are (pretty steep) road tolls to pay if you use the autoroutes. If the UK is going to have some sort of road pricing scheme, I think we’re likely to see one like that proposed by a senior official in the Department of Transport, Michael Dnes, in a tweet thread he was later forced to delete (because politics). He suggested that road charging only be applied to brand new EVs. He said it could be done quite easily because the latest EVs already have the tech to track their usage. There would be legal and political issues to overcome around data protection and privacy, but it’s possible. For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think we’re actually going to see a road pricing scheme of any sort implemented in the near future – or ever. The odd hair-brained scheme may be announced, but it’ll be withdrawn once the political and practical implications become clear. So, what will we hear in the Autumn Statement? It’s highly likely the freeze on fuel duty will end with an increase of 5p per litre, possibly more. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a consultation on how best to tax EVs is announced. The Labour government is happy to make itself unpopular and bloody-mindedly push ahead with politically damaging plans (witness the winter fuel payment debacle) in an effort to stabilise the country’s parlous finances. Even so, at this stage, implementing a road pricing scheme that affects every driver would be too expensive and too controversial to be worth it. But I’ve been wrong before."
191,The Kia electric vans - first teaser shot of the PV5 before it arrives in 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/pbv-electric-vans/,Tom Webster,2024-09-19,Car Magazine UK,"The look of the production Kia PV5 has been hinted at on the brand’s stand at the 2024 IAA van show in Hannover. Although the vehicles on the show stand are the same ones that appeared at CES in January 2024, there were a couple of silhouette images of the production versions tucked away on the back of the stand. Given it’s an outline, it doesn’t give huge amounts of detail but it is possible to determine a couple of crucial factors about the production models. Firstly, the level of tech is being dialled back for the vans that are going on sale – there are conventional door mirrors in place of the camera-and-screen setup of the concepts. The other notable observation is that the fundamental shapes seem to be much the same, which would back up Kia insiders’ claims that the concepts are very close to the production versions in terms of shape and look. The headlight design is the same basic shape, although slightly less angular. Kia also confirmed some welcome details at the IAA, namely that the PBVs (Kia’s slightly odd name for its vans) will get the same seven-year 100,000-mile warranty as its passenger cars. This would give the Kias one of the longest warranties in the class, with only Toyota’s unsurpassed 10-year cover bettering it. The other claim is one that you might expect a brand to make about its new vehicles – it is targeting best-in-class performance for elements such as payload, capacity and turning circle. However, this is where it gets it a little unusual, as the dimensions of the PV5 (and its larger sibling the PV7) sit neatly between two categories. It’s slightly larger than conventional small vans such as the Citroen Berlingo but a bit smaller than the medium Ford Transit Custom. Perhaps conveniently, Kia says that the best-in-class claim refers to the smaller of these two classes. It would make sense that a bigger van has more space inside, but increased payload and a smaller turning circle are both a bonus. The final confirmation of note was that fast-charging capabilities will be part of the PV5’s offering, too, with up to 150kW on a DC connection and 22kW via AC. Our photographers have previously caught the PV5 out testing, while heavily disguised. In a hint at the sort of vehicle that Kia is targeting, it has been spotted alongside the – another van that sits between those conventional categories. However, Kia also had a out alongside the PV5, which gives another hint that the brand’s so-called PBV won’t just be your average base-level workhorse white van when it launches in 2026. We can expect a high level of technology on board, such as drive-by-wire steering and braking, in-wheel motors and highly integrated electric features. Kia has subsequently said at the IAA that it aims to cover a wide range of potential buyers, though, so there should be a lower-spec model as well as the highly equipped version. Kia revealed as many as five concept vehicles at the CES show in Las Vegas in January as it signalled serious intent to take on the world of electric vans. The Korean brand hasn’t had any real involvement with the world of commercial vehicles in Europe, but it is looking to change that as it launches its new ‘Platform Beyond Vehicle’ business. And while lots of the early literature has talked about ‘PBVs’, these are light commercial vehicles (LCVs) or just vans in plain English and expect the UK marketing to reflect that. It is doing far more than just talking about it, though, as it revealed three sizes of van at in Las Vegas, with the PV1, PV5 and PV7 shown in concept form, with a PV3 also planned for the future. As well as showing what the vehicles might look like, Kia also outlined how and when it intends to bring these vans to market and what sort of physical and software tech there will be behind them. Expect swappable tech and modular assembly so a vehicle can be changed easily and quickly from being a van during the week and a taxi at the weekend. This suggests you will be able to tweak your Kia electric vans once you have bought it, should your business needs change over time. While there will be three fundamental van models, there is scope for many more shapes and sizes in the PBV range, as illustrated by the concept vehicles shown in Vegas. The vehicles are based on an adapted version of the same under the EV6, but in two lengths and in a ‘skateboard’ style, which means they can be stretched and adapted. The PV5 is the mid-size van, although it is slightly smaller the likes of the . Instead, it’s more like a long-wheelbase Citroen Berlingo or a VW ID.Buzz Cargo. In a bid to show the flexibility of the architecture, there are several versions of the vehicle on display, with a high-roof model, a people-carrying minibus, a self-driving Robotaxi and even a pick-up truck. Alongside all these was a standard-roof panel van, which is the model that will form the core of the range, if the PV5 is anything like the rest of the van market. This is the one that was given prominence at the IAA too. This version is around 4.7m long, so fractionally shorter than the Ford, and is set to be offered with front-wheel drive. A longer-wheelbase version is possible for the future, though. There are some clever-looking touches on the various vehicles, with the high-roof model offering enough space and height for a driver to walk through from the cabin to the loading bay. The people-carrier comes with features such as seats that be configured in various layouts and a sliding see-through partition that divides the cabin from the main seating area in the rear. The space for the passenger seat is given over to storage in the concepts. Also on show at CES were a PV1 and PV7 concept, with the latter a larger medium van that will measure around 5m to 5.7m in length. There is little information on exactly how big it is in terms of carrying capacity or how much payload it can take, but it is said to be the largest model in the planned range for now at least and is ‘defined by more space, greater distance, and enhanced functionalities.’ It is set to launch with a front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive version. The PV1, as the name suggests, is the smallest concept on show, but it is even smaller than the conventional small-van class – it is better seen as a last-mile delivery vehicle, similar to the likes of the . However, this is very much a pie-in-the-sky vehicle for the UK, as it is a self-driving vehicle that is unlikely to be legal on UK roads. It has some very clever features, though – the loading floor is the same height as the other vans, so anything loaded in can slide from the bigger vehicle to the PV1. It also has a tiny turning circle which is achieved by rotating the wheels around so it can spin on its axis. There was also a pick-up truck on show, but Kia says this is more of an exploration of what is possible rather than a confirmed model. What is going to come is a PV3, which will be a smaller van – more of a rival to the likes of the Ford Transit Courier. However, Kia has not said when this will be launched yet and is yet to show a physical vehicle, even in concept form. Instead it appeared as an image on a screen, just briefly, at a presentation in Las Vegas. Expect this to be several years down the line. Given that Kia is launching a range of commercial vehicles with a completely blank sheet, it is little surprise that it is looking to provide more than a selection of basic vans. There is scope for customisation in various forms, partly courtesy of its so-called ‘PBV Ecosystem.’ This is a posh way of describing the racking and storage possibilities in the rear loading bay, which come via an integrated rail system on the floor, ceiling and internal side walls. This means that items such as cabinets and frames for internal racking and storage solutions can be easily swapped in and out of various vehicles. By offering such features from the factory, this could remove the need for many customers to head straight to a third-party to get a load of systems fitted in the back as soon as they have bought their van. However, it is not yet clear whether buyers will be able to fix in the sort of racking that they have been using in vehicles for many years – plenty of van owners will transfer the fixtures and fittings from their old vehicle to a new one when they replace it. The current plan is for the PV5 to be front-wheel drive only, while the PV7 will be front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive. Despite Kia’s standing start, we shouldn’t have long to wait until the brand’s electric vans head out to the market. The first PV5 model was originally planned to come as soon as 2025 however, this has now been pushed back to 2026. Production While UK pricing has not yet been set, Kia has said that the PV5 will start at around 35,000 Euros (around £30,000) when it goes on sale. It has said that it sees there being three phases to the PBV rollout, with the PV5 set to be the first model to go on sale in late 2025, followed by the PV7 in phase two, which will start around 2027. As well as the PV5, phase one will also see the launch of some of the software that will be supporting the vehicles. The PV1 will follow in 2028 where it is legally permitted. This phase will then bring more connectivity and the PBV Ecosystem that will allow the vehicles to swap cargo between each other. Phase three is less defined at this stage in terms of precise vehicles or products, but this is when Kia is saying it expects to be able to add the sort of future tech that isn’t possible right now – a greater degree of self-driving ability, robotics, Artificial Intelligence and even Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This is currently set as being from 2032 onwards. The AAM ecosystem is being developed by Supernal, which is looking at the mobility possibilities that could be available, while Boston Dynamics is looking at what could be done with robotics.

192,Europe has fallen out of love with Ford - can this man win us back?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ford/jim-farley/,Phil McNamara,2024-09-24,Car Magazine UK,"Jim Farley’s company jet will be on the ground in Nice for less than 24 hours but the Ford CEO is determined to put his mark on this major moment, albeit fleetingly. ‘ is an important one for us,’ is his opening remark to CAR. To back up the rhetoric, Ford has . With travel influencer Lexie Alford – who blogs and makes videos as Lexie Limitless – at the wheel, the Explorer has covered 18,830 miles on six continents to become the first EV to circumnavigate the globe. Today Lexie, her Explorer and the boss cross the finish line to mark the car’s commercial introduction. Ford is making a big deal out of this all-guns-blazing PR stunt: you can’t move for Ford-badged employees and dealers in the port-side hospitality area, and Ford is streaming the climax to its workforce. The dismal weather barely dampens the enthusiasm. A convoy of amazing and eclectic Ford heritage vehicles are here – from a replica of the Model T that became the first car to circumnavigate the globe a century ago, through Mustangs and GTs to the electric and that embody contemporary Ford – reminding us of the cars that made the Blue Oval matter. On stage Farley demonstrates his car-nut credentials, firing off vignettes to the crowd as he recounts the GT40’s racing pedigree (‘you’ve got to love GT40s – what a beautiful car’), telling the 1967 Bullitt car’s backstory (‘it was the first big-block Mustang, so great at burn-outs!’) and joking about how a mid-engined RS200 Group B rally car ended up in Essex police livery. ‘That’s forbidden fruit in the USA,’ he mutters, sounding like he fancies putting that right one day. And that’s the crux of this rose-tinted show of strength: Farley’s strategy is to make passenger cars that tap into the DNA of Ford’s big hits to reignite customer passions. ‘We’re getting out of the boring-car business and into the iconic-vehicle business,’ he tells me. ‘We’d always competed at the heart of the passenger-car market, which didn’t work out too well for Mondeo, Focus and Fiesta. They were loved by a lot of customers but they could never justify more capital allocation – unlike commercial vehicles.’ Farley believes the Puma, developed when he ran Ford of Europe, Africa and the Middle East from 2015 to 2017, epitomises his new strategy. Combining a popular body style with a winning design, a beloved name plate and a higher price to boost margins, the small SUV was the UK’s best-selling car last year – and the Transit family the top-seller overall. The UK is ‘kind of a home market’, the CEO reckons, although VW usurped it as the biggest-selling brand during the Covid-19 era, a situation that won’t be reversed as Ford switches from a car-for-everyone approach to more upmarket, carefully targeted vehicles. , in a $1 billion refit to manufacture the electric Explorer and its sibling, . Pointedly Jodie Kidd drove a 1972 RS 2600 version of ‘Europe’s Mustang’ in the Lexie Limitless convoy. The Focus – represented by the Mk1 RS, the ultimate fast Ford badge, and one that Farley hints will return on future cars – will bow out of production in 2025. ‘We’re naturally good at fast Fords and and authentic off-roaders,’ he explains. ‘Ford’s brand perception was the same around the world: we were a ubiquitous company. But we had these little areas of brightness: we have heritage centres around the world filled with these [great] vehicles, but they were never mainstream. ‘Take Raptor: it came from desert racing in Mexico and we made it global and mainstream.’ With jacked-up ride height, beefed-up suspension and big engines, there are now Raptor versions of , and the Bronco SUV. ‘The Raptor story is a great example of where I think our passenger cars should go.’ Warming to his theme, Farley continues: ‘We can take on Porsche with Mustang – it’s the best-selling sports coupe in the world. We’re going to invest in that brand and get stronger and stronger.’ Hence the dollars being wildly hosed at motorsport, from , to long-standing World Rally Championship interest, to off-road racing Broncos, to the Mustang’s assault on Le Mans this year. The hall-of-fame convoy includes a Mustang Dark Horse, which sired the FIA GT3 racer, which in turn inspired . With 800 horsepower, part-carbonfibre body and an outrageous aero kit to glue it down, the GTD will have a six-figure price and the scent of Porsche GT cars in its nostrils. ‘Ford never funded enthusiast products – they were always a side business. Now with Mustang, Raptor and Bronco, they’re our business,’ says Farley. He’s one of those leaders who likes to listen as well as talk, for instance sounding me out on whether Bronco could compete with Land Rover in the UK. ‘The big Bronco will do right-hand drive and I think it’s worth a try,’ he muses. Then he chuckles: ‘We had a break-up with a marriage there,’ referencing Ford’s sale of Land Rover to Tata in 2008. ‘The next step is to go dating again, right?’ Before then, this August, the UK gets the Explorer EV. The mid-size SUV’s hardware is Volkswagen Group’s MEB electric-car platform, a deal signed the year before Farley moved offices from COO to CEO. Two ‘extended range’ Explorers are being offered at launch, one rear-wheel drive, the other four-wheel drive. The £45,875 rear-drive version packs a 77kWh usable battery and a 210kW motor (282bhp). It’s almost Focus ST quick: 0-62mph takes 6.4sec, dropping to 5.3sec for the twin-motor Explorer. This has a combined peak power of 250kW (335bhp) fed by a fractionally bigger 79kWh pack. Those powertrains largely mirror VW’s, though Ford reckons its fine-tuning has delivered figures that are (for now) class-leading: the RWD’s 374 miles of range, and the AWD’s 26-minute charge time (from 10 to 80 per cent on a 185kW DC charger). Those are the details that matter to car buyers, not who supplies the battery, insists European design director Amko Leenarts when I mention the lack of Ford proprietary technology. His design team have done a splendid job stamping Ford’s identity on the MEB underpinnings, not just by chopping 120mm out of the rear overhang and shrinking the boot to 450 litres. The bluff sides give presence, the clean surfaces modernity and the blacked-out pillars, including a rearward ‘sail’ graphic, make a visual connection with America’s bigger (non-electric) Explorer SUV. I take a brief passenger ride on the damp roads around St Paul de Vence. The commanding seating position feels authentic SUV, and there’s a long overdue improvement in Ford interior design. All Explorers get a two-tone dashboard, seats trimmed in sporty, leather-free Sensico and a prominent, 14.6-inch vertical touchscreen, its interface familiar from Mach-E not ID. 3. The screen manually pivots by 30˚ to adjust visibility and uncover a clever storage area to hide valuables; owners will welcome the huge armrest stowage too. Beneath, thunking manhole covers and jarring tarmac ridges are relayed to the cabin by taut suspension, which reins in bodyroll and float. There’s an engaging electric-motor whine as the Extended AWD spins eagerly up to speed, and murmuring from the Continental tyres. Springs, dampers and anti-roll settings are bespoke. Partnering with Volkswagen helped Ford get a European-sized EV to market two years quicker than going it alone. But Jim Farley flatly refuses to answer whether the MEB co-operation will be extended, instead talking about Ford Otosan, ‘our best partnership globally’. This commercial-vehicle venture with huge Turkish conglomerate Koç Holding embraced Volkswagen as part of the MEB deal, so VW’s new Amarok pick-up is a rebadged Ford Ranger and the Transporter and Transit are being pooled. ‘In commercial vehicles, Ford is the number one brand in Europe and the US. Man, we’re just great at work vehicles,’ he enthuses. But a proposed Turkish battery gigafactory has been shelved. Has President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its huge subsidies for home-grown electrification initiatives, sucked Ford’s investment in batteries and vehicle platforms back to the US? ‘The US has never had an industrial policy like Europe, Japan or China; the IRA was one of the first. And it’s changed the math for manufacturing batteries and for customers looking at EVs,’ the CEO replies. ‘But despite all that, customers have many uncertainties regardless of what a manufacturer wants their line-up [to be] or what regulators in Brussels want.’ Those uncertainties include resale values, energy costs and charging on long road trips, he reckons. This is the turbulence through which Farley must pilot Ford. An airspace where government policy can upend plans for good or ill, where electrification invites new rivalries. ‘The Chinese brands are coming to Europe and they’re incredibly fit competitors. In the EV business, Tesla and the Chinese are our main competition.’ All the while customer desires are fragmenting, heaping extra pressure and costs on car makers. ‘We make [America’s] best-selling ICE vehicle – the F-150 – also as a hybrid and EV. In California, 85 per cent of F-150 sales are electric or hybrid. In Texas 85 per cent are combustion!’ Amid that uncertainty, he’s got to make the call if vehicle platforms should be pure electric or multi-energy, made in partnerships such as the Explorer’s or developed in-house. And it sounds like the MEB partnership is very much a short-term play. ‘If your bet is the digital experience as a differentiator, you can’t use someone else’s electric architecture. If I use MEB, then another architecture in China, one in North America and another for export, that’s multiple different software. Software that has to be written to the individual module for propulsion, braking, steering, seats. If [Ford] is very committed to digital differentiation, it’s impossible to have that complexity. ‘One of my biggest bets as CEO is our platforms, including our electric architectures. There will be places where we work with each other, such as MEB. But in the future that will be harder, not easier.’ From a purist’s perspective, that sounds like a good thing. For Fords to be distinctive and packed to the core with its finest DNA, creating EVs that shine like S-Max, Mk1 Focus or Fiesta ST for a new generation, it needs to rediscover its Midas touch. Then Europe might see the characterful cars Farley promises, icons for the 2020s and beyond."
157,Bentley’s new look is here – and it’s sharper and simpler than before,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bentley/new-winged-b-badge/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-07-08,Car Magazine UK,"Bentley has a new look! Earlier this month it revealed a redesigned badge, the fifth version of the famous B in its 106-year history. Officially called the ‘Winged B,’ the new logo follows a similar design and theme to the one created by F. Gordon Crosby way back in 1919. It’s just been followed by a significantly less subtle concept car, . You can also read . The logo redesign was led by Robin Page, Bentley’s director of design – but was a team effort. An early version of the new logo won an internal design competition, and further tweaks and refinements followed. ‘In more than a century of history, this is only the fourth evolution of Bentley’s iconic Winged B, and redesigning it was a formidable task for which we’ve taken great care,’ said Page. ‘In an era of ever-increasing complexity and fidelity from digitalisation, an exercise of simplification and refinement is a modern necessity – and so the new emblem is cleaner, sharper and more impactful than its predecessor.’ The new logo has undergone further tweaks and refinements, designed to make it bolder and easier to recognise across media. With that in mind, the wings are now sharper and more angular – and the ‘tail feathers’ underneath the B have been removed entirely. Look at the images here, and you’ll see just how subtle the changes are. It’s a similar treatment to Aston Martin’s recent logo update, which has also refined and simplified.

158,"Why Bentley hasn’t just copied Jaguar with its new concept car, according to design boss",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bentley/robin-page/,Ted Welford,2025-07-09,Car Magazine UK,"As soon as I saw the first pictures of the , it was inevitable that comparisons were going to be drawn to last year’s . Similarly bold, different to their firms’ traditional offerings, they show a new side to these storied British car brands as they grapple to give modern luxury customers what they want, even if they might not know it yet. On Bentley’s own Instagram post, some of the most liked comments, unsurprisingly, concern THE Jaguar concept (pictured below). ‘Did no one learn from Jaguar’s mistake’ says one person. Another says ‘what in the Jaguar’. A pun I wish I’d thought of first. In an interview with Bentley’s design director Robin Page, who sketched the EXP 15 as one of his first tasks at Crewe after joining in September 2023, it was the question on everyone’s lips and I jumped in first to ask about the similarities to the new Jag. But not before Bentley’s CEO could get in there with a quip, joking ‘Jaguar who’. ‘The Jaguar is a very different size of car [to the EXP 15],’ says Page, who has the unenviable job of making Bentley’s design more modern while still mixing it with traditional elements. ‘They [Jaguar] follow their design principles as well, which is British heritage. Just generally in the design world you follow design inspirations and trends. More modern surfacing and a cleaner design are definitely trends at the moment.’ Page served as head of Bentley interior design between 2001 and 2013 before going to work at Volvo for a decade, implementing cars such as the and , truly transitional products, which have helped completely change the Swedish brand’s audience and success. Similar is now planned at Bentley, which knows the customers wanting luxury cars are now typically younger and want something that looks modern rather than classical. The EXP 15 is the result of that. Details on it will influence , a luxury ‘urban SUV’ due in 2027, but instead this concept more explores more around the future of what a Bentley saloon car might look like. Page says they know and understand the market for their and – and more importantly their customers – well, but the saloon market is a challenge. These days, only customers in China and the US tend to buy these in any great numbers and what they expect from a four-door car is changing. The now accounts for only around a quarter of its sales, and it’s now been five years since the bowed out as a true Bentley flagship. Page says: ‘What is interesting is the sedan market as that is something that are changing their expectations of. You’ve got three-box, sort of coupe-styled low, high, etc, so we thought we would test the waters with an elevated sedan, and take some influence from the beautiful Blue Train. ‘The whole SUV market took off because of this elevated presence, this higher seating position, this statement of importance and confidence on the road, but we’ve never explored this on the sedan market, they have always remained low.’ It’s Bentley’s heritage that it hopes to build on in the future of luxury, and an element it knows can separate itself from the Jaguar, which was a ground-up redevelopment for an ailing firm. When asked how Page’s Bentleys can be differentiated, he said: ‘We’ve seen all the way through the automotive design journeys that there is always a level of trends going on at the time, but for us, we’ve got a great car to reference in terms of our iconic Blue Train. ‘The proportions and the size of this car are completely different to the Jaguar, but of course we’re all going for that modern design that’s attractive to the next generation.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."

160,"New Mazda CX-5: family SUV wasn’t broken, has been fixed anyway",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/cx-5/,Jake Groves,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"One of Mazda’s most popular cars returns for a third generation. The new CX-5 manages to be both VERY Mazda, as well as very un-Mazda at the same time as this version introduces new tech, new engines and a new(ish) look. We are. Yes, granted – the design is definitely an evolutionary step over the old one, but that’s deliberate. The has tonnes of loyal buyers who’ve had a few, and Mazda’s design team have been keen not to put them off while also making the car that little bit sharper. Mazda’s sold 4.5 million of them worldwide, so is keen not to rock the boat too much. Sharper headlights, new wheel designs and a little bit of a visual clean-up of some of the lines and creases. Mazda, like pretty much every other manufacturer, is stepping away from having its logo on the rear – replacing it with the brand’s font, too. In fact, the CX-5 marks the start of a new brand identity for Mazda. There is indeed: buttons. Which is a massive shame, as Mazda is quite possibly the best in terms of offering cars that not only still have physical switchgear, but ones that are well laid out and feel tactile to use. The interior in the CX-5, however, seems to have been heavily inspired by the electric 6e’s interior, with many of the physical touch points – including the very welcome click wheel usually found on the centre console – being removed. Not all of them, though. Jo Stenuit, design director for Mazda Europe, is quick to point out that there are a considerable number of physical buttons on the steering wheel, so the driver never has to focus anywhere else than straight ahead of them. ‘Driver-focused and pure,’ he calls it, pointing to the fact that Mazda never loses sight of cars like the MX-5 that are right at its core. We’re still unconvinced, however, even as Stenuit assures us: ‘we’re not Volkswagen.’ The steering wheel buttons may be physical, but many of them are part of one single panel that doesn’t easily allow you to tell the difference between each one via touch alone. That, then, still forces you to take your eyes off the road… and look at the bafflingly busy steering wheel instead. And, besides it being generally quite large (either 12.9 or 15.6 inches depending on spec), the screen itself steals quite a lot of attention because the CX-5 is the first Mazda to use a Google-based infotainment system. That means Google Maps and its Gemini AI assistant are included, and the inclusion of the Google Play store means you can install apps to your own liking. Other than that, though, the CX-5’s new interior feels like a good place to spend time. The seats feel supportive and have plenty of adjustment, and the material finish is good, too. Space is most impressive in the second row, with tall adults able to sit behind tall drivers. Mazda clocks luggage space at a good 583 litres – 61 litres more than before. That figure is way larger than a or , and competitive with a . Four trims will be available, starting from Prime-Line, up through Centre-Line, Exclusive-Line and topping out at Homura. Every CX-5 includes 17-inch alloys, LED headlights, digital instruments and a 12.9-inch infotainment screen, adaptive cruise. Luxuries in higher trims can include things like a sunroof, Bose audio upgrade, larger wheels or a larger infotainment display. Yes, you can – exclusively with one, in fact. Although the launch engine is rather piddly in terms of the performance offered. For now, you can only spec a new CX-5 with a naturally-aspirated 2.5-litre petrol engine with… wait for it… 139bhp. Of course, this amount of power compared to this amount of displacement is unsurprising; Mazda likes to do things its own way, with pretty much every car it makes coming with a powertrain choice that defies convention. Moritz Oswald, the CX-5’s project manager, points out that this engine does have more torque than the old 2.0-litre petrol, however – all 176lb ft of it – and keeping the engine turbo-less means better throttle response, too, he says. Instead, the 2.5-litre engine (which is also in the 3 and CX-30) simply comes with a 24-volt mild hybrid system for a very gentle power boost. That’s good for a 10.5sec 0-62mph sprint for the front-wheel drive version, or a 10.9sec one for the all-wheel drive model. Your only transmission option is a six-speed auto. Want a diesel? Mazda’s response is: buy a instead. Want a hybrid? You’ll have to wait another year or so, when launches with more significant electrification. Mazda is keen to put across that the CX-5 is still a good handling thing. The suspension has had some tweaks compared to the previous generation, with a softer spring setup and modifications to the anti-roll bars and dampers. If you spec the all-wheel drive version, the CX-5 will also come with the brand’s G Vectoring Control Plus system – which is basically torque vectoring. Production will start in October 2025, with the first Euro-spec ones landing in the first couple of months of 2026.

This is the 95-59, and it promises to be much more than a mystery meat of Woking’s finest supercars. The name comes from 1995, the year that Lanzante won Le Mans, combined with the number of the winning car. Yes, it’s a homage to the cult-classic Ueno Clinic . And it has three seats. ‘95-59 is the result of everything I personally and we, as a business, have learned and experienced over three decades since winning Le Mans,’ explained Dean Lanzante at the car’s launch at the . Finished in Ueno Grey the 95-59 looks eerily familiar, but that’s because it’s been penned by Paul Howse, the designer of the original P1. With that in mind, it follows an even more extreme philosophy than that of the P1, with a carbonfibre body shrink-wrapped over a contemporary, reworked McLaren platform. Key to the entire design though, is the inclusion of three seats – with a moveable driver seat flanked by two passenger seats. ‘The central driving position was a key part of the initial discussions for this project,’ Howse said. ‘We wanted something that looked organic, with an aggressive edge to it, but clean. In the same way fighter jets are designed with purpose and poise, without superfluous intricacies and design trends.’ Howse’s design work means the car has the lowest possible belt line, with organic shapes helping to ease it – rather than force it – through the air. Even a brick with these specs would handle well, though. Lanzante has stuffed a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 between the passengers and behind the driver and mated it to a seven-speed SSG transmission, and it’s quoting a power output north of 850bhp and 649 lb ft of torque. It’s a sliver of a thing at weighing as little as 1250kg with the optional LM30 pack fitted, and that gives it a power-to-weight ratio of some 700bhp per tonne. The LM30 pack also includes extras like lightweight forged alloys, F1-derived Inconel exhaust headers and titanium tailpipes. That element is also used for the body fixings, and gold-plating is used as heat-shielding throughout the engine bay and exhaust area. That’s for heat protection but serves as another link to its iconic McLaren F1 ancestor. Interested? Just 59 examples will be made, priced at £1,020,000 plus local taxes. You better get in quick! It’s an automotive business obsessed with McLaren that’s specialised in motorsport as well as restoring and servicing historic sports cars. Lanzante Motorsport was the business that won the 1995 Le Mans event with a McLaren F1 GTR – hence the link.

162,The difficult second album: Hyundai Ioniq 6 N launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/ioniq-6-n/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"I have endless respect for Hyundai’s N division. It proved to the world that can be an absolute riot, providing you put a petrolhead at the top of the company and give him the freedom to make cars driving enthusiasts want to buy. If I needed an electric car, I’d head straight to a Hyundai dealership. And now, I’d have more choice. Meet the new Hyundai Ioniq 6 N, revealed today at the . Don’t be fooled into thinking this is nothing more than an in a flowy frock, though. The Ioniq 6 N is a completely different animal, not least because it’s been designed to go around a track quickly rather than sideways. It might share the same E-GMP architecture as its smaller sister, but its dampers are different, its spring rates are different, its geometry’s unique, its motors have been improved and it cools much better better, meaning you thrash it harder for longer. Plus, the software controlling all the mechanical bits has been completely re-written. Scroll down to find out why you’re going to want one when it goes on sale in November 2025. Maximum power and torque are the same as the Ioniq 5 N. You get 641bhp and 568lb ft (which is ample in my book). But, because Hyundai has improved the magnets inside the motors and upgraded the 6 N’s cooling system, you can access more of that power more often. Plus, you now don’t need to keep mashing the big red N Grin Boost button on the steering wheel to unlock the car’s maximum potential. Sven Risch, one of Hyundai N’s Senior Engineers, told me Ioniq 5 N drivers aren’t using the function as often as they can on the track because they’re already at cognitive capacity simply managing the playfulness of the chassis. That was hurting lap times so, in a car so unashamedly designed for the track, the decision was made to dial the extra power into the accelerator. At least in N mode. You still get to pretend you have NOS when you’re pootling the 6 N along in Normal mode. Top speed is slightly slower at 160mph and, although Hyundai hasn’t yet confirmed the 6 N’s 0–62mph time, I’d be very surprised if it was slower than the 5 N’s 3.4-second time. Range is pretty good, too. Hyundai’s current estimates put the maximum figure at 291 miles. Granted, that’s 47 miles behind the most efficient version of the – and it achieves that figure with an 84kWh battery rather the standard car’s 77.4kWh unit. But the N has almost triple the amount of horsepower, so that doesn’t seem like a bad result to me. That’s quite an understatement. Hyundai’s N division has tickled almost every panel on the car – and I don’t really think the images do the tweaks justice. The Ioniq 6 looks mean in the flesh. The biggest change Hyundai’s N department had to accommodate was how to make the body fit around its wider track and fat new alloys. The solution was a widebody kit. It’s 30mm wider each side, which doesn’t sound like much – but it makes a huge impact. Once it had figured that out, Hyundai could focus on the 6 N’s aero package. There’s a new front splitter, wider side skirts, a massive rear diffuser and a swan-neck rear wing that looks like it was pinched from a GT3 racer. Hyundai won’t tell us how much downforce the changes produce, but its engineers did tell me that extras such as the air curtains ahead of the front wheels and the deflectors under the splitter allow the air to pass more cleanly over the body and contribute to the car’s near 300-mile range. Even the forged 20-inch alloys have been designed with aerodynamics in mind. They have a massive (and immensely kerb-able) lip running around their circumference which pushes some of the air away from the hubs, preventing it from getting minced by the spokes and causing drag. Hyundai N’s obsession with performance even forced its engineers to drill holes in the spokes of the alloys to shave a few grams off each corner of the car and reduce unsprung weight. That’s dedication, right there. The cabin has some big changes, too. You get the same N-branded skin for the infotainment system as the Ioniq 5 N, the same racy Alcantara steering wheel and a pair of sublime racing seats. I tried them in the studio and they’re easily as good as any seat from Porsche. Again, it’s different. Most of the elements from the Ioniq 5 N remain – torque vectoring, active dampers, an electronic limited-slip differential, an incredibly sophisticated traction control system – but they’ve been adjusted to suit the 6 N brief as a track monster. Sven Risch told me this new car should be even more predictable at the limits of grip, which should make it even easier to screw fast lap times out of it. Hyundai hasn’t lost its mad streak, though. In addition to all the grip-biased technology, you get an even more sophisticated version version of the firm’s Drift Mode, which means even someone as ham-fisted as me should be able to skid it about like Daigo Saito. Where the 5 N’s technology was basically an on/off toggle, the 6 N’s operates like a dimmer switch. It has three sliders that allow you to customise the amount of angle you’d like from your drift, the ease of initiating said drift and – I swear I’m not making this up – the amount of smoke you’d like from the rear tyres.

163,RN24: Hyundai’s cut-and-shut go-kart will soon morph into a new hot hatch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/rn24/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has a habit of making production cars out of its prototypes. The Concept 45 faithfully evolved into the Ioniq 5, while the set the blueprint for the new Ioniq 6 N. But the RN24, a Frankenstein’s monster of scaffolding and horsepower, described by the firm’s own engineers as a ‘Rolling Lab,’ couldn’t possibly preview a new electric performance car. Could it? I certainly thought as much – and I couldn’t have been more wrong. At the UK launch for the , Joon Park, vice president of Hyundai’s N division, told me he has plans to turn it in into a ‘smaller, C-seg’ performance car. Probably a hot hatch, by the sound of it. The aim of the project is to create a more compact electric performance car that capitalises on all the learnings from the Ioniq 5 N and Ioniq 6 N, but which offers better controllability, sharper handling and even more fun. Plus, rather than piling extra power into the RN22 to make it more exciting, Joon says he’ll strip weight out. Joon explained: ‘The physical weight itself should be reduced to have much more fun in the future. So, for example, that’s one of the reasons that we – not the big car like, you know, SUVs or something. ‘We’re going to have a newer generation of our electric platform. And then, we have a newer technology on our electric platform. For the high performance [cars], we want to have a lighter one. I’m not talking about the power. Power itself can stay as it is, because, you know, if we are just increasing the power only, it does not make a fun car. ‘So, one of the things that we talk internally is that if we have money, and if we have effort, and if we have limited resources, that we would like to rather refine this current level of power to have much more fun. Because easily we can increase the power. But at the end, power is not everything without control.’ ‘RN24 exemplifies Hyundai N’s commitment to advancing electric motorsport technology by prioritizing the driving experience rather than spec numbers,’ said Joon. ‘This Rolling Lab proves that there remains untapped potential for high-performance EVs and with new technologies ahead, there is much to look forward to.’ The RN24 is based on a cut-down version of the E-GMP architecture you’ll find under the . It features the same 641bhp dual-motor powertrain, but the suspension has been peppered with upgrades pilfered from Hyundai’s WRC exploits. Oh, and it weighs just 1880kg (which is nothing for an EV) and can get from 0–62mph in less than 3.4 seconds. I’ll canter through some more of the upgrades. There are rally-spec dampers, stiffer subframes and a WRC-spec Powertrain Drive Control logic system that offers greater customisation. Drivers can adjust acceleration sensitivity, brake regen severity and the power spilt between the two axles. There’s even a rally mode that optimises the power delivery for chucking rocks at spectators on a special stage. Cooling has also been improved, while the steering response has been sharpened compared to the Ioniq 5 N’s to improve the go-kart feel. There’s also an e-handbrake that uses regenerative braking to lock the rear wheels and initiate a slide. This has the added benefit of reducing weight compared to a conventional one. Finally, Hyundai engineers have also included two side-speakers and the Ioniq 5 N’s Active Sound+ set up, so it’ll generate the same sounds as the – before amplifying them through a rear apron that acts like a soundbox. But the biggest change is the wheelbase. Hyundai cut 340mm out of the middle of the Ioniq 5 N, bringing the RN24’s wheelbase down to just 2660mm. Incidentally, that’s a similar size to the i20 N WRC car – and it puts the RN24 slap-bang in the middle of B-segment. Somehow, though, Hyundai has managed to reconfigure the Ioniq 5 N’s battery within the space and retain the same 84kWh capacity. All this is encouraging for the production car, although Joon and his team still feel limited by the technology of their time. He wants the next big improvement in battery technology so he can hack more weight out of the car – and he’s ready to adapt when it arrives. ‘With the current technology and current models that we are doing, this is the current state of art technology that we are having. But at some point, when we have a little bit more substance – a better component out there that we could make for the future as an advanced technology, then it’s the way we need to go.’ It’s all eyes on Hyundai again, then. And for good reason. It’s set out its stall as the brand that going to save the world’s petrolheads from the era of hydrocarbon prohibition. I wish it nothing but the very best of luck.

164,Still want that Tesla? MG goes upmarket with its IM5 and IM6,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/im5-and-im6/,Ted Welford,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"MG is going for the Tesla with the reveal of its new IM5 and IM6 at the , an EV saloon and aiming to open MG up to a wider audience. The brand has earned a great reputation for its value for money in recent years, with models such as the and in particular growing its sales. In 2024 MG became the 10th most popular car brand in the UK, overtaking Vauxhall and Skoda despite a smaller line-up of vehicles. But MG is now looking for a more premium slice of the pie with the reveal of the IM5 and IM6, larger, more advanced and more expensive electric cars that have the and firmly in their sights. Over in China IM Motors is a standalone brand under SAIC Motor, MG’s parent company, with IM standing for ‘intelligent in motion’. But given MG’s already strong presence in the UK, it’s been decided to launch them under the existing branding. The two cars are already on sale in countries such as China and Australia but are now arriving into Europe for the first time. Both the IM5 and IM6 are considerably larger and more premium cars than what we’re typically used to from MG, each measuring more than 4.9m in length. Although they’ll rival Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y, they’ll be closer in size to the and . David Allison, head of product and planning for MG in the UK, said: “MG has made EV ownership accessible, exciting and different with the leading the way for the brand. But now, we’re seeking to deliver technology leadership and innovation with MG IM, engaging with customers aspiring for the future, today.” We’re still waiting for MG to detail the full specs, but the IM5 is available with a choice of 75kWh and 100kWh batteries, with the IM6 only getting the larger of the two. The IM5 75kWh sits on a 400V charging structure, offering far lower charging speeds than the 800V network that underpins models fitted with the 100kWh battery. With the latter, MG is promising a 10 to 80 per cent charge in just 17 minutes, and a maximum DC charging speed of 396kW. Single-motor, rear-wheel-drive models and four-wheel-drive dual-motor will be available on both cars. Providing the cars mirror the line-up available in Australia, which we expect them to, the rear-wheel-drive versions will develop 402bhp and accelerate from 0-62mph in 4.9 seconds in the IM5 and 5.4 seconds with the IM6. At the top of the line-up will also sit Performance versions, producing a truly ridiculous 766bhp, and making Teslas look a bit old hat. The IM5 can sprint to 62mph in 3.2 seconds and the IM6 in 3.4. Yes, we’re also questioning why on earth they need that level of power. More positive, however, is the maximum claimed range, with MG saying the IM5 can travel up to 442 miles on a charge, making it one of the on sale. The technology on these new EVs represents a significant step up compared to what we’ve seen on MG’s so far, Cyberster aside. Fully autonomous park assist is a first, as is rear-wheel steering, a feature usually reserved for luxury cars. On the IM5, it means a turning circle of just 9.98m – a metre less than that of a . Inside, a panoramic 26.3-inch display is spread out across the interior, with a panoramic glass roof fitted as standard, as is a 20-speaker sound system. A separate lower touchscreen is also present, and can be used to control features such as ventilation. MG also promises ‘exemplary cabin refinement’ from their double-layered laminated windows throughout. Prices for the MG IM5 kick off from £39,450 for the 75kWh model, £44,995 for the Long Range 100kWh model and £48,495 for the Performance version. As for the IM6 SUV, as it’s only offered with the 100kWh battery, prices start from £47,995 for the rear-driven model and £50,995 for the Performance. MG is also offering a Launch Edition, which gets features including air suspension, for £52,995. Orders are expected to open imminently, with first deliveries expected later in the year.

165,MG Cyber X concept: a vision of the future from the past,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/cyber-x/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"MG has had an interesting comeback. The brand has been around for more than a century, having forged its reputation with its sports cars. But when it was bought out by the Chinese automotive conglomerate SAIC in 2006, it evolved into a purveyor of sensible, reasonably priced family hatchbacks and SUVs. For MG’s design department, that must be quite dull. Family cars are far less interesting to draw than lightweight cabriolets – so, occasionally, the company likes to give its designers a bit of freedom. The last time this happened, we got the electric sport car. This time round, we’ve got the Cyber X SUV. The Cyber X might look like a real car from a distance, but once you get up close you realise it’s just a polycarbonate shell on wheels. That’s because its job is to preview MG’s future design direction rather than lay the foundations for a finished motor. It appeared on MG’s stand alongside the . It does, in a strangely conformist sort of way. There’s a lot of nostalgia sloshing around the car industry right now, which is motivating a huge push towards retro design. Just look at cars like the , , and . To my eye, the boxy lines of this MG concept seem to mash together elements of the old Ford Bronco and Land Rover Defender, with a dash of the Mercedes G-Wagen thrown in for good measure. But MG’s design department has chucked in a further nod to the past. It also has pop-up headlights like a Lamborghini Diablo. I’ll say it again for the folk sleeping at the back. They might be utterly miniscule, they might never get past pedestrian crash-safety regulations and they might look completely out of place on this tall-riding SUV, but I welcome their return. MG is still being rather coy about whether the Cyber X will roll down its production lines. As I said, there are still question marks over the legality of those pop-up headlights and how the car will slot into the company’s range. However, Guy Pigounakis, MG UK’s Commercial Director, told me he’s incredibly keen to get car off the drawing board and onto driveways. He said: ‘If it was down to me, yes. It’s not, clearly. There’s got to be proper assessments. I am just one opinion in that. You know, whether you think something is absolutely fantastic, you’ve got to do the analysis to make sure that you’re not just commissioning something that you personally like. But would I have that car tomorrow? Absolutely.’ Guy’s reservations are sensible. But the thing is, MG has a knack for making its concept cars real. Take the Cyberster as an example. Its turnaround from show car to showroom was a mere two years – a fact Pigounakis was more than happy to recognise. He said: ‘That car today is purely a concept, which is disappointing a lot of people because they want to hear that it’s a prototype and it’s about to go in production. Today it’s not. But we do have the ability to turn a prototype into a production car . Yeah, very quickly.’ Encouraging. As is the fact MG has obviously thought about how it would market an eventual production model. David Allison, MG’s head of product and planning, told me: ‘We would sell a Cyber X-style product to someone that wouldn’t buy a ZS hybrid.’ Meaning, someone who’s looking for a more expensive-feeling product. ‘We’re in this business to sell volume, to make money,’ he said. ‘Our dealers are in this business to do exactly the same thing. For me, it’s always important that every time we bring a new product to market, there is a clear and defined customer to whom we’re going to sell that car to. I can absolutely see that with those two cars down there [the IM5 and IM6]. I can definitely see that for that car down there [the Cyber X].’ The market in question is more premium than what MG has already carved out for itself – and it’s something the brand is testing with the £50,000 IM5 and IM6. And to prevent any confusion with its more affordable cars, Allison suggested that MG could split its Cyber-badged models off into a distinct premium silo in the same way BYD has with its more expensive sister brand, Denza. That’s one thing MG is still sitting on the fence about. When quizzed on powertrains and platforms, Allison said: ‘I think, again, that’s a commercial decision. It’s difficult, isn’t it? Because if you’re going to do it as an EV, you’d have to do it off an EV platform, which wouldn’t necessarily work from a combustion engine point of view. I suppose a lot of it will be dictated by where it is sold. ‘I think if you sell it in China, EV is the obvious place to go. If you sell it in Europe, hybrid at the moment is the obvious place to go. Particularly in lots of European markets where EV is nowhere near as proficient as it is, even in the UK, which is still only 23–24% of the market. So, yeah, if we did it, that would still be a decision we’d need to make.’ Interesting times ahead for MG, then. Stay tuned for more news.

166,The second coming: Hyundai plans new i20 N and i30 N,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/hyundai/hot-hatches/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"Being a petrolhead in 2025 is tough. Our hobby is steadily being legislated against thanks to tougher CO2 targets, increasingly stringent noise regulations and expanding low-emission zones. The amount of red tape required to get a fast combustion car into showrooms is either putting manufacturers off building one or sterilising the finished product. But Hyundai doesn’t seem fazed. I recently spoke to the N division’s irrepressibly petrolheaded visionary, Joon Park, at the launch of the – and he told me his engineers are working on a hybrid-powered replacement for the i20 and i30 N. ‘We are not limiting ourselves into EV,’ he said. ‘But this is some kind of tendency after we launched , because Ioniq 5 N was a huge message for the entire car industry. And a lot of people thought and think that Hyundai N is going towards only for EV. It’s not true. ‘The discontinuation of i20 and was a for me. But it takes time to it takes time to have a new one. So yeah, we are not focusing on EV only. We are not. I’m not the person who actually really likes the EV. I’ve always liked the smell and the sound and all those kinds of race cars.’ Joon explained Hyundai N’s shift back into petrol power won’t be easy, though. The brand can’t make as much money on a small, fast petrol car as it can on a larger, more expensive . The markup just isn’t as strong. But he couldn’t give a flying proverbial. ‘Hyundai N has to be reachable,’ he said. ‘We actually want to play with our friend groups, with a proper priced car and reachable price cars. We are not talking about luxury exotic car. We are talking about the Hyundai N level. In that case, where should we go? Where nobody else is existing anymore, except for GTI. ‘Last movers advantage could exist, right? But it could be a first mover to invest a lot of for those smaller cars which do not make that much amount of profit margin. ‘Higher price, higher profit margin, right? Small car, lower price, lower profit margin. So, if we want to have a B-segment car then I need to work very hard to persuade everybody. So, this is what I’m doing. B or C, or it doesn’t matter. But at the same point, I also need to take care of our customers who really wants to be in this area.’ Joon kept that card close to his chest. However, he did confirm that he won’t be able to revive the old i30 N’s 2.0-litre petrol engine. It’s dead. ‘I’m responsible for the global market. Europe is not going to be easy,’ he said. ‘All those kinds of things that we actually – you know, the 2.0 turbo engine for 280 PS, or something like. That cannot exist anymore based on the current regulation and future regulation.’ However, Hyundai’s 1.6-litre Smartstream engine could provide a lifeline. This engine is already used in the self-charging hybrid versions of the and – and a high-output, non-electrically assisted variant of it is found under the bonnet of the i20 N. Hyundai could feasibly take the i20 N’s 201bhp engine, wind a bit more boost into it and then bolt on a beefy hybrid system to crank its combined output up to a level that can keep pace with the and . I reckon upwards of 300bhp should be manageable. The Santa Fe’s self-charging hybrid tech adds 53bhp to that 1.6-litre engine, while the PHEV system adds 91bhp. And I’m sure Hyundai’s engines can find the missing ponies from the engine to make up the shortfall.

167,Chery to become latest Chinese car brand to launch in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/chery/tiggo-8-suv/,Ted Welford,2025-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"Chery is the latest Chinese car brand to announce it will launch in the UK, with the firm set to start selling cars later this summer with its Tiggo 8 Super Hybrid. Making its UK public and debut at this weekend’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Tiggo 8 SUV will be the first car to be sold as a ‘Chery’, despite the automotive group already selling cars here under its Omoda and Jaecoo sub-brands. Both of these have already made their stamp in Britain, selling 6,941 and 8,399 cars in the first six months of 2024 alone. That’s more than well-established mainstream car firms such as Fiat and Jeep sold in the same period. The Tiggo 8 will be the first Chery car in the UK to be sold with seven seats, though given it’s labelled as a ‘5+2’ arrangement, the third row is expected to be tight for space. Using a 1.5-litre petrol engine as its base, it’s paired to an electric motor for a combined 201bhp and 269lb ft of torque. An 18.4kWh battery also allows for up to a claimed 56 miles of EV range, with Chery claiming it’s capable of driving up to 765 miles on both power sources. The exterior styling is inoffensive, with a fairly smart chrome grille despite its size and a rear that has a whiff of Kia Sportage about it, no bad thing. A twin screen headlines the interior, with standard equipment including adaptive cruise control, a 12-speaker Sony sound system and a panoramic sunroof. Set to be primarily sold at dealerships with existing Omoda and Jaecoo franchises, it will come with a seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty. Pricing and full specs for the Chery Tiggo 8 are still being finalised, though are expected to be announced in the next few weeks, but we expect it to start from just above £30,000, putting it against the MG HS and Nissan X-Trail. Chery UK country director, Farrell Hsu, said: ‘Goodwood is one of the most prestigious stages in the automotive world – so there’s no better place to reveal Chery’s most versatile and refined hybrid SUV to a UK audience. ‘The Chery Tiggo 8 Super Hybrid is a perfect expression of what Chery stands for: smart technology, generous space and electrified efficiency without compromise. It’s designed to make people happy, knowing they’ve made the smart choice for their next SUV.’ Geely is one of several new Chinese car brands which have recently announced their plans to enter the UK. MG revealed its IM5 and IM6 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed as more of a premium sub-brand. BYD-owned Denza is also out in full force at the FOS with its chunky B5 4×4, while Geely, the Chinese owners of Lotus and Volvo, also confirmed it would soon start selling a car under its own name in the UK.

168,"New, hybrid Corvette e-Ray is coming to the UK and Europe",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/chevrolet/corvette-e-ray/,Jake Groves,2025-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"General Motors has confirmed that the Corvette E-Ray – the sports car’s first ever electrified variant – is coming to both Europe and the UK. Ones that launch here will arrive with right-hand drive, too. Corvette took to the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed to make the announcement, sending the hybrid E-Ray model up the hill. The C8-generation has been around for a few years now, with the E-Ray making a slow and gentle launch into its home market in the states over the last year or so. We , feeling like a proper sports car much more than any previous generation had. For the E-Ray, the 6.2-litre ‘Small Block’ V8 driving the rear wheels remains, itself generating 475bhp and 452lb ft on its own. It’s then supplemented by an electric motor and battery pack that throws in another 159bhp that drives the front wheels. Corvette claims a total system output of 634bhp, meaning a 2.9sec 0-62mph sprint. ‘It’s truly a different entry for Corvette,’ Tony Roma, Corvette chief engineer tells CAR at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Roma points out that, when designing the C8-generation Corvette, an electrification element had always been part of the plan. ‘Looking back almost 10 years ago, we knew electrification would become a bigger thing, as has become for other cars around us in the Supercar Paddock,’ he says. ‘When we started C8, we architected the car for the electric elements of the powertrain to be in the central tunnel, which is part of the reason this car feels incredibly solid. ‘Power-wise, it’s basically almost the same power as the ZO6, too. But it is more of a GT car, this one – more of a long-range cruiser,’ adds Roma. ‘People who already have one in the US are already bragging to me how many states they visit when they buy the car and go on long road trips.’ Visually, beyond the widebody elements, the E-Ray isn’t designed to shout too much about its hybrid-ness. ‘We want people to have the look of the widebody you get with the ZO6 model, which comes with wider front tyres to help you use the electrification in the front end,’ says Roma. And, because it’s electrified, Corvette says the E-Ray has drive modes like Stealth Mode that’s designed to get you away from your house without disturbing your neighbours, and Shuttle Mode that’ll keep the engine off for doing the same thing when you return home. As well as the power on offer, Corvette throws in some toys for the E-Ray. Carbon ceramic Brembo brakes and adaptive ‘magnetic ride control’ dampers are included, with Michelin Pilot All-Season 4 fitted as standard. Pilot Sport 4S rubber can be applied as part of a performance pack. Prices aren’t confirmed yet, but Roma confirms that it will be a bit more expensive than a Stingray – obviously.

169,Goodwood Festival of Speed ultimate visitors' guide: the cars and stars you won't want to miss,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/goodwood/festival-of-speed/,Tommy Begley,2025-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"Summer heat, Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix… Yes, we’re already in early July and that means that it’s time for the Goodwood Festival of Speed (FOS). The 2025 festival opened on Thursday 10 July and runs all weekend until Sunday 13 July – and it’s a sunny, dry one, with temperatures set to top 27deg C. Looks like you can keep your umbrella at home this time (or take one as a parasol). In this festival preview guide we explain the key highlights, people and cars to watch. Read on for our suggested highlights and best bits to see. We’ll be updating it over the next few days, as more news arrives from Lord March’s motorsport mecca. This year’s Festival of Speed looks to be particularly special for F1 enthusiasts. Celebrating 75 years of the Formula One World Championships, there will be a chance to glimpse some of the iconic cars and drivers from across the decades. Some notable attendees are: Three current Formula 1 teams are set to be in attendance: Atlassian Williams Racing, and MoneyGram Haas, as well as more than 100 F1 cars past and present. The theme for this year is ‘Winning formula – Champions and Challengers’  to shed light on the inspirational pioneers and innovators that have shaped different strata of motorsport today. The central feature (see top image), designed by 73-year-old sculptor and designer Gerry Judah, dazzles visitors every year in front of Goodwood House. This year it celebrates 60 years of automotive design from Gordon Murray, who has brought many motoring marvels to the world, such as the and the IGM Ford T.1. Rally fans will be happy to see a celebration of Colin McRae’s thirtieth anniversary of his 1995 World Rally Championship win. FOS will honour his racing legacy by bringing together his iconic ’93 Subaru Legacy, ’95 Impreza 55, ’97 Impreza and ’01 . Starting in 2017, Future Lab has been the place to see global innovation for a better tomorrow. 2025 is no different, offering interactive exhibitions for all ages. This year it centres around the key themes of: New Industrial Revolutions, Exploring Spatial Intelligence, Mobility for Humanity, and Our Big Blue Dot. As is customary, this year the Red Arrows make an appearance not once, but four times over the weekend. Their 22-minute acrobatic displays are accompanied by the famous red, white and blue vapour trails and be hard to miss wherever you happen to be at the time. As any long-time Goodwood aficionado will know, Shootout Sunday brings the very best drivers to Goodwood hill for the Hillclimb. Former F1 driver Max Chilton’s 2022 record of 39.08 seconds will be in everyone’s sights and is sure to be a spectacle. As ever, there will be a rich spread of cars on offer for visitors to this year’s festival to ogle. Last year, took centre stage, celebrating the brand’s centenary with its in pride of place on Judah’s yearly featured sculpture. Trying to keep the momentum going, the brand has unveiled two new Tesla-busting EVs, , both of which are already available in the Chinese and Australian markets but without the MG livery. One of these will compete in the infamous hillclimb, and with a claimed 0-62mph of 3.2 seconds for the performance model, it may do quite well. MG has also brought the compact and Cyberster Black to Europe for the first time. The McLaren-based Lanzante project car, named , has already been unveiled at the 2025 festival. Automotive business Lanzante specialises in restorations and developing unique vehicles. The company has been focused on McLaren ever since winning the 24-hour Le Mans back in ’95 with a McLaren F1 GTR. Project 95-59 is a three-seat, limited-run sports car, following in McLaren F1’s footsteps of having a seat layout with the driver in the centre. The biggest draw, perhaps, is how the car performs; with a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 producing more than 850bhp and 649 lb ft of torque, the 1250kg carbonfibre machine boasts 700bhp per tonne. It’s certainly not going to be a slug out of the traps. Hyundai has picked the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed to unveil the new . Unlike its hot hatch sibling, this performance saloon has been designed for the track and the dynamic features have been honed to follow this new brief. , which simulates a real manual gearbox feel, and you can now even choose how much smoke you’d like with your drift. This is definitely a car to keep an eye out for in West Sussex this weekend. Aston Martin has brought along its much anticipated new hybrid superstar. The Valhalla is the roadgoing cousin to the track-focused , with a greater focus on creature comforts. The concept version was initially unveiled in 2019, dubbed the AM-RB 003 and has been much refined since then. The car boasts a 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbo petrol engine which works alongside two front-axle and one rear-axle electric motors, producing a purported 937 bhp. With a production cap of 999, there might not be another chance to catch a glimpse of this car for a while… Lotus is rolling out its Theory 1 concept car for people to gawp at. This car is seriously interesting, boasting a weight of 1600kg (not bad for an EV) and a 0-62 mph time of 2.5 seconds. However, it’s the use of just 10 surface materials (the bits you can see before you start taking off body panels) compared with the industry average of 100 that makes this car interesting. Check out also the ‘robotic haptic control buttons’ which appear only when needed; so if you have to answer a phone call, a physical button appears from the dashboard, disappearing when no longer required. It’s tech built by Berlin company MotorSkins. It’s great to see digital innovation played out in the physical world like this – suggesting there is life beyond the touchscreen. This could well be one of the most technologically innovative machines at Goodwood. General Motors’ first hybrid sports car has been taken to the festival this year adding fanfare to the announcement that the car will be launched in the UK and EU. First released in north America in 2023, sold in fairly low numbers compared with and . With a total system output of 634bhp and 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds, Corvette is going to try its hand up the hill this weekend. Let’s just hope the more electric-friendly UK and EU markets can help to turn the sales figures around. It’ll need to be good to persuade Brits to part with £153,440 for the privilege… With a self-imposed need to release a new sports car every year, Maserati has 2025. Looking suspiciously both in the metal and on paper, there is a good chance this may be more of a colour-and-trim exercise than a brand new car. It is undeniably sexy though in its new light blue, bordering on turquoise, paintwork and detailing. It’s definitely worth stopping to take a look if you happen to be walking past the Maser stand, but just don’t expect anything game-changing. Chery is a Chinese brand that you probably haven’t heard of yet, but the automotive group has been selling its and sub-brands in the UK since last year. is hitting a pretty flooded SUV market. It pairs a 1.5-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to produce 201bhp and it’s expected to sell at around £30,000 when it launches here. If you’ve forgotten to grab your tickets, the standard day passes are now sold out, sadly. The only way in is to purchase potentially expensive hospitality tickets or inquire about returns. As the time of writing, the most cost-effective tickets we could find were for the . It’s a group deal with access to the grandstand and is situated right by the track, is fully catered and has an unlimited bar. The Goodwood Festival of Speed has become motorsports enthusiasts’ go-to event in the UK. Every year for the past 32 years, drivers, vehicles, enthusiasts and families have come together to share their passion for forward momentum in all its myriad forms. There has been motor racing on the West Sussex estate since 1936. The ninth Duke of Richmond, Freddie March, hosted a hillclimb meet for Lancia enthusiasts and subsequently, and perhaps embarrassingly, won the race himself. The famous Goodwood Motor Circuit was built in 1948 and was host to Britain’s first post-war race meet at a permanent venue. It closed in 1966 due to safety concerns, as cars were becoming faster than the track was able to cater for safely. But in 1998, five years after the FOS was started, initially just using the old hillclimb track, the circuit was re-opened and the rest, as they say, is history.

170,Lamborghini Temerario GT3 revealed: race car drops the hybrid and improves the usability,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lamborghini/temerario-gt3/,Ted Welford,2025-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"Lamborghini has revealed its new Temerario GT3, its next-generation racing car that promises to be quicker and easier to drive than its old Huracan. Shown for the first time at the , it’s the first GT3 car that has been designed, developed and built in-house by Lamborghini, with the racing car being conceived while Lamborghini was penning the . Promising some big improvements over the previous , it swaps out that car’s old-school naturally-aspirated V10 for the turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 engine used in the regular Temerario. However, unlike the road car it doesn’t feature any hybrid element, with this not being permitted in the GT3 racing class, nor wanted by customers because of the hybrid’s complexity for racing teams to work on. The also drops the road car’s PHEV setup in place of a V6. Compared to the 907bhp produced by the road car, the GT3 puts out what seems like a fairly meagre 542bhp, though features a new smaller turbocharger and compressor unit (required to meet GT3 regulations), which alters the way the power is limited . It’s paired with a six-speed transverse gearbox, and also features a specific Capristo exhaust. There are three main improvements over the old Huracan GT3, as explained to us by Rouven Mohr, chief technical officer at Lamborghini, who is open about the Huracan being an ‘old-generation’ car and having some ‘weaknesses’ next to the competition. ‘The main thing we say [which lets us down] is the engine torque based on the naturally-aspirated engine, but now with the new torque curve and how the torque is delivered, we have a lot more freedom with this turbo engine.’ That’s one box ticked. The second is improving the modularity of the Temerario GT3, essentially how easy it is to rebuilt if it’s in a crash. It’s built around a simplified version of the road car’s aluminium spaceframe, allowing for easier removal and reattachment of the front and rear subframes. The bodywork is also said to have been ‘engineered for quick disassembly and assembly’, reducing the time it will spend in the pits. ‘Our car today is still quite limited and old-generation compared to the newer ones,’ says Mohr. ‘For sure, that gap will close.’ The third area Lamborghini has worked to improve is how easy to use the GT3 is, especially during endurance races. Mohr says the Huracan’s ‘steering wheel is quite old-fashioned’, so ergonomics have been improved with a new one  along with revised switchgear with new graphics. ‘So if you have hot conditions in an endurance race, if you have rainy conditions, it’s not so comfortable, to be honest to drive our old car is much tougher. In an endurance race the comfort of a driver is important. For gentlemen drivers, the Huracan GT3 has been quite tough to drive.’ Other differences for the Temerario GT3 include a new system that enables an increased refuelling rate, while revised fuel sensors can give a more accurate reading to the team. The Temerario GT3 has a longer wheelbase than its predecessor, and combined with a wider track aims to improve stability in the corners. New six-way KW dampers are also fitted, which can now be changed quickly in the pits. There’s no word on pricing, but Lamborghini has said it plans on exceeding the Huracan GT3’s sales of 200 units over the course of the Temerario GT3’s lifetime and says it has the car do it.

171,Lamborghini plots different kinds of hybrid for Temerario supercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lamborghini/future-temerario-hybrid-variants/,Ted Welford,2025-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"Lamborghini’s technical boss has confirmed the firm is plotting different kinds of hybrid powertrains for its , with a detuned rear-wheel-drive model next on the way. The Temerario replaced the last year and with its plug-in hybrid setup now means every new Lamborghini road car is electrically assisted. The current Temerario 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine produces 789bhp on its own, but is joined by three axial flux electric motors (two on the front axle, one sandwiched between the engine and eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox). All combined together, they produce a mammoth 907bhp. But we now know Lamborghini is plotting less powerful, slightly cheaper versions of the Temerario, including – first on the way – a rear-wheel-drive model, following a similar path to what it did on the Huracan. Rouven Mohr, chief technical officer at Lamborghini, told CAR that different kinds of hybrid powertrains are in the pipeline. ‘I’m not saying in the future you couldn’t see a 2WD version of the street car, and then perhaps a different kind of hybridisation,’ says Mohr. Mohr wouldn’t go into details on this, but one option could be removing the front two electric motors capable of driving the wheels on their own and leaving the one between the engine and dual-clutch gearbox. This would make the Temerario rear-wheel-drive and more of a conventional hybrid, which also wouldn’t require plugging in to recharge. ‘This [sort of hybrid] is already available today,’ says Mohr, referring to the T-Hybrid system in the (pictured below), which the technical boss calls a ‘super example of a completely different hybrid approach’. The T-Hybrid system works with one electric motor in the 911’s PDK gearbox and a second tiny motor to help boost the turbo, and means it essentially eradicates any lag. The result is impressive, you don’t even realise you’re driving a hybrid. Mohr was speaking ahead of the reveal of the new Temerario GT3 racing car – all the more interesting because it’s a Temerario that’s not a hybrid, owing to GT3 rules not permitting the technology, nor race teams wanting the additional complexity. Asked if Lamborghini could make a road-going Temerario without any hybrid assistance, Mohr didn’t rule it out completely but said it wasn’t on the priority list. I would not completely exclude [a non-hybrid Temerario], but it’s not on the priority list. The probability is quite low, never say never, but at the moment, we have a lot of other things to do, and I would not bet my money on it. ‘Just because we’re going racing and it’s not a hybrid, it doesn’t mean this would be the right approach for the street.’ Mohr also spoke more about Lamborghini’s EV plans, with the firm already pushing back the launch of its first electric car (previewed by the in 2023) by a year to 2029. What’s clear is that the firm is happy to take a step back and watch the development of the EV market from afar, but says its hybrid strategy was the ‘right one’. For sure we are observing carefully what happens on the market and what situation is going on. But this isn’t a secret, we know the transformation speed is different compared to to what we expected. ‘We are a little bit lucky because we are exactly in the time when everyone is wanting a hybrid and we have hybridised our entire line-up. Our strategy was exactly the right one.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
193,Does it work? Polestar 4's digital rear-view mirror tested and explained,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/polestar-4-rear-screen/,Ben Miller,2024-09-30,Car Magazine UK,"It is Ferrari design boss Flavio Manzoni’s fervent belief that great design doesn’t mean steamrollering engineering challenges in the name of style. Instead, he says, designers should understand the thinking behind the engineering and see the demands it places on the car’s exterior form as inspiration, not a limitation. Clearly, though, there’s a third way – use technology to square the circle. When it came to the , the brand’s iPace-style coupe/ crossover, head of design Max Missoni wanted a coupe roofline on a package that, thanks to its underfloor battery and rear-passenger headroom requirements, really didn’t lend itself to the idea. The answer was to move the header rail, a key part of the car’s structure, rearward, behind second-row heads rather than above them. Doing so creates decent headroom beneath a sexy, supersonic roofline. A reclined seating position also does its bit. Does the theory extend to real life? It does, and in some style. Climb into the back and the 4’s second row is roomy in the extreme (as you’d hope given the 2999mm wheelbase and 4.84m overall length). Headroom is generous and the interior design quirky but gorgeous, with a neat wing motif that runs around the back of the rear seats, mirroring the same idea around the two people up front, making you feel snug and safe and happy. The vast panoramic roof can be optioned with electro-chromatic glass and, despite the lack of natural light from behind, there’s no sense of claustrophobia thanks to gentle ambient lighting. Colour themes, inspired by the planets of the solar system, are nicely presented on the screen, complete with Polestar-show-car-in-space animation. But of course no rear glass means a normal mirror is good only for checking one of your children hasn’t painted the other one blue with a handy felt pen. Hence the digital rear-view mirror. These aren’t a new idea (the second-gen Evoque featured the same) but of course in the 4 you have no option but to use it. The mirror uses a feed from a 2.5MP camera high on the trailing edge of the roof, and features a far wider field of vision than a mirror, so that its image overlaps generously with what you see in the actual glass of the side mirrors. Yes. Although something about glancing at a screen after decades of mirrors takes some acclimatisation. That said, it’s a far less demanding shift than, say, camera side mirrors.

194,Alpine to wind down F1 engine program: Viry-Châtillon set to become Hypertech Alpine,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alpine-f1-engines-viry-chatillon/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-09-30,Car Magazine UK,"Alpine is winding down its F1 engine program, with the company set to stop developing F1 powertrains at its Viry-Châtillon facility. Instead, the site will become Hypertech Alpine; a new centre for innovation and R&D. Resources and employees will be redistributed as part of the transformation, and the team will continue to make the current Alpine engine until the end of 2025 – it just won’t develop one for the forthcoming 2026 rules. The news comes after months of speculation. Most believe it’ll result in an engine deal with Mercedes from 2026 onwards to coincide with new engine rules. If true, that would mean Alpine cars would be powered by a different brand, which seems confusing from a marketing point of view… ‘Creating this Hypertech Alpine centre is key to Alpine’s development strategy and, more broadly, to the Group’s innovation strategy,’ said Alpine CEO Philippe Krief. ‘It is a turning point in the history of the Viry-Châtillon site, which will ensure the continuity of a savoir-faire and the inclusion of its rare skills in the Group’s ambitious future while strengthening Alpine’s position as an “innovation garage”. ‘Its racing DNA remains a cornerstone of the brand. It will continue to fuel an unprecedented industrial and automotive project, thanks particularly to Hypertech Alpine’ The team has been struggling as of late; it sits 9 of ten teams in the constructors’ championship – and is by far the worst performing works team with just 13 points. It’s possible management has suggested the team concentrate on the chassis side instead. After all, creating a competitive powertrain in F1 isn’t easy. And creating your own isn’t essential for winning either, as McLaren’s recent success with a Mercedes engine proves. It’s a blow for F1 in many ways, but the writing has been on the wall for a while: paddock sources have claimed the Alpine/Renault engine is down on both power and reliability compared to the others. Alpine has also been unable to benefit from using data from multiple teams in the way that Mercedes, Ferrari and RB Powertrains do, as it only supplies its own two cars. Mercedes, for example, powers Aston Martin, McLaren and Williams in addition to its own cars – eight in total. Alpine isn’t scrapping Viry-Châtillon, but is instead rebranding it as Hypertech Alpine. Its mission goal is predictable. According to today’s release it’ll ‘bring together some of the best talent in the world to contribute to the development of ultra-high-performance vehicles and innovations in cutting-edge technologies, for Alpine and Renault Group.’ Battery and electric motor technology sit at the top of the list, but the centre will also contribute to the development of a new Alpine supercar. It’ll also play a role in other motorsport programs such as the WEC, Formula E and Dakar. F1 powertrains are very much off the list, but it will continue to monitor the sport at least: ‘Formula 1 activities at Viry, excluding the development of a new engine, will continue until the end of the 2025 season,’ the release goes on to say. Interestingly, Alpine also says the Hypertech facility will be concentrating on ‘the development of engineering services for other companies,’ something we’ve seen teams such as McLaren do with great success. Alpine is keen to stress that this won’t result in job cuts, but rather a redistribution of expertise. The release says that ‘each employee affected by this transformation project will be proposed a new position within Alpine Hypertech.’ It’s a way of keeping experience, expertise and jobs within the company, after all. We’ll update this story when we know more. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

195,Peugeot 408: new electric version joins the range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/peugeot/408/,Phil McNamara,2024-10-03,Car Magazine UK,"Peugeot’s striking 408 crossover now benefits from an electric version: the e-408. The new e-408 has joined the range in 2024, with Peugeot saying its arrival ‘completes the EV line-up’ for the brand. Need a reminder as to what the 408 is? Read our handy guide here. Right? It’s also designed to be segment-busting. Is it a hatchback? Is it a coupe? Is it a crossover? Technically all three. ‘The 408 is an inventive, dynamic fastback: it blends sedan [saloon] and SUV cues such as a high driving position. And it has a strong presence on the road,’ says Peugeot product director Jerome Micheron. Peugeot is reluctant to pigeonhole the 408, preferring to cite the ‘active couples’ who will supposedly be drawn to it (though there’s a heap of rear space for when they have to forego base-jumping for changing nappy-wearers). The dimensions put it in context however. It rides almost 4cm higher than a 308 hatchback, but about 1.5cm lower than BMW’s X4 coupe-SUV. The roofline is comparatively lower too: the 408 stands 1480mm high, the X4 1621mm tall. ‘Our intention is to reinvent the [midsize] sedan,’ says design director Pierre-Paul Mattei. ‘We want to create a new worldwide model, more modern, exciting and bold. ‘It’s an empty space, and we are convinced Peugeot has something new to fill this space. New 408 is closer to a sedan than an SUV, but it’s not a typical sedan design.’ Glance at the rear three-quarter, and you’re struck by how unusual, how aggressive the design is. A bulbous black plastic diffuser juts out rearwards, and sharp lines fan out from the rear wheelarch, breaking the fender into facets. The thin rear lamps are crowned with a Porsche-style ducktail spoiler, fed air by the ‘cats ears’ either side of the tailgate. ‘The imposing black rear bumper absorb shocks when parking the car,’ says Mattei. ‘We use this to give dynamism: we cut the body colour, creating an inverted effect. It gives a very strong personality to the car. As of October 2024, quite a few. The range starts with the now-quite-old-school 1.2-litre PureTech petrol, which comes with 128bhp, front-wheel drive and an eight-speed auto. A short step up is Peugeot’s new ‘Hybrid’ (it’s pretty mild, in reality) model with 134bhp and a new six-speed dual-clutch transmission. This powertrain launched in the all-new 3008 SUV, but has since been ported across to other models in the range. Next up is the plug-in hybrid model available with two states of tune: 178 or 222bhp. Both use a 1.6-litre petrol engine, 81kW electric motor and eight-speed auto and claim up to 34 miles of e-range. Topping the list is the new arrival: the e-408 electric model (pictured in white). The e-408 uses a 58.2kWh battery pack and a 208bhp electric motor driving the front wheels, and Peugeot claims a 281-mile range. ‘The rear of the car is unusually high, higher than the front hood: that’s where we use the cut of colour to absorb this extra volume,’ continues Mattei. The high rear gives strength: it’s very muscular, nothing is neutral.’ The rear overhang is sizeable, intentionally to free up cargo space. The boot stores 536 litres, or 1611 with the rear seats folded. That’s slightly more than either the Peugeot 3008 or BMW X4 SUVs offer. Mattei admits the two-tone effect is to help disguise the overhang; the 20inch alloys’ counter-intuitive squared-off design has the same effect (which suggests the base 17inch rims may be somewhat overwhelmed). When this GT model in Obsession Blue is manoeuvring at low speeds, the wheels’ square graphic really stands out – Mattei calls it ‘disruptive’. The interior will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s pored over the new 308’s: they’re the same. ‘When we asked our creative team to design the dashboard, we didn’t ask them to design the dashboard of the 308 but the 408’s,’ reveals Mattei. ‘And during development, we kept checking that what we were doing was still compatible with the 308.’ Peugeot didn’t have the design capacity nor budget to work up divergent cockpits, so the 308 hatch, SW estate and now the 408 share the design. That may explain why some of the dashboard’s angular planes feel more at home in the crossover than the hatch. Naturally the 408 gets Peugeot’s trademark compact steering wheel, and a 10inch digital driver’s display with 3D effect on GT models. The 10inch central touchscreen has six customisable, digital shortcut keys underneath to access your most-used functions. The 408 is embedded with Peugeot’s new voice control system, and comes with optional Night Vision. In the rear seats there’s plenty of kneeroom, but only a couple of inches of headroom for a six-footer. The front and rear screens are thickened to soften external noise, and the Allure option pack complements this with thicker side glass. Peugeot took the unusual step of showing the 408’s origin design, a yellow crossover bearing the project’s codename P54 (below). ‘Every day we have exchanges with the brand, asking what will be next in the Peugeot range, how will the market change?’ explains Pierre-Paul Mattei. ‘Here we asked what could be the next worldwide sedan. ‘We worked on several different concepts. At the end we were convinced that this could be a solution for something worldwide. Then we had to convince everybody in the company that this was the way.’ And this yellow concept served as inspiration – despite it being completely unfeasible. ‘Nothing works technically, it would be impossible to do that car,’ says Mattei. ‘Because when you make a car, you have to integrate the door stiffener, you couldn’t even open this trunk, the aerodynamics don’t work at all and this kind of shape for a [rear screen] would cost the same as all the windows of the real car. And we don’t respect the suspension. ‘But it gives the vision. We try if we can. And that’s why there is such a difference between this car which was created in 2015 and the new 408.’"
196,Hyundai Inster EV: prices for dinky electric supermini start at under £24k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/inster/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-10-03,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has confirmed pricing for its all-electric Inster supermini. The brand says the baby EV’s pricing starts at £23,495 in the UK. The Inster is a (mostly) new A-segment EV designed to sit at the bottom of the brand’s electric offering, under the and Ioniq 6 streamliner. It uses the South Korea-only, combustion-powered Casper as a base, but stretches the wheelbase before filling it with an EV powertrain and some pretty innovative features. Hyundai is calling its new A-segment EV the Inster, which isn’t short for Instagram, but is instead a mish-mash of the words ‘intimate’ and ‘innovative.’ Nope, we don’t get the link either. It seems the suits in HQ knew the ‘Casper’ name used by the combustion version would not go down well, but chose a slightly more embarrassing moniker to replace it. Why not call it an Ioniq model? That’s easy, because it according to Hyundai suits that sub-brand is reserved for EVs that use . As a result of Hyundai’s tinkering, the Casper’s transformation to an EV has added an extra 230mm of length with 180mm of that in the wheelbase. Almost all the length is to the benefit of the rear passengers. The Inster will be available in a 42kWh version capable of up to 203 miles, and a Long-Range 49kWh version capable of 229 miles. Both models will use a single motor for 95bhp in the 42kWh model and 113bhp in the Long-Range 49kWh car. Torque is the same for both at 108lb ft. When using a 120 kW DC charger it’ll recharge from 10 to 80 percent in around 30 minutes and the Inster can even can be ordered with . ‘The design is all about having a charismatic exterior and a very functional interior, Victor Andrean, Hyundai designer told CAR. ‘Important is this very high nose and the general proportions. It makes you feel like you can take it on an adventure and feels a bit off-roady in a way. It’s got this duality between friendliness and ruggedness.’ In order to acknowledge its new EV powertrain, Hyundai’s stylists kept the broad strokes of the Casper, but gave it the usual smattering of pixels as its other EVs. ‘When you see pixels, it’s Hyundai. It’s EV,’ Andrean tells us. It’ll run on 15-inch steel rims with wheel covers, 15-inch alloys or 17-inch alloy wheels for the higher spec cars. Despite all the style, the Inster looks a little ungainly on the outside – but it all pays off once you get in the cabin. It’s decked out in sustainable materials but almost everywhere you look, Hyundai’s engineers have crammed innovative, practical thinking. The dashboard is symmetrical, even the front row of seats feels airy, and a lack of transmission tunnel means that the driver can easily exit the car from the passenger door. ‘You could say it’s democratic,’ Andrean tells us as we shuffle out for the third time. Above you’ll find a sunroof, and elsewhere a wireless charger and 64-colour ambient lighting. All the usual tech is here too, such as ADAS and lane-keeping along with a duo of 10.25-inch screens. There’s a good amount of open storage for quickly stowing bits and pieces. However, it’s at the rear where the extra 230mm in length over the Casper really pays off. Adjustable and reclinable seats make it easy to get comfy and on the most extreme inclined setting I had more than enough room to relax behind myself. Pretty impressive for an A-segment EV. There are other nice touches: the front passenger seat can fold down so the driver can put their bags next to them, and it’ll also act as a footrest for rear passengers with delusions of grandeur. The rear door cards and front seats also feature attachments which Hyundai says will be used for a range of accessories. We’ve seen a few prototypes in action; from a table to a wallet and photo album. Cool, but not essential. CAR understands that a more rugged version called the Inster Cross will follow in a few months. Although it’ll look different, it’ll have the same ride height and dimensions – just expect more adventurous-looking front and rear bumpers. The interior could have a different spin too. Hyundai suits hinted that there’ll also be a cheeky N-line version of the Inster to come – and we’re here for it. Hyundai says the Inster range will start from £23,495 for the 42kWh battery option and can be had with the larger battery or more powerful battery. The base Inster ’01’ model features 15-inch alloys, a 10.25-inch infotainment screen, digital instrument cluster, rear parking sensors and camera, adaptive cruise, climate control and more besides. The Inster ’02’, priced from £26,495, is only available with the larger 49kWh battery and 113bhp motor, and comes with bigger wheels, front parking aids, those clever folding/sliding seats and heated front seats.

197,"We need to let customers decide whether they want an EV, not legislators, says Skoda boss",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/skoda/electric-car-choice/,Ted Welford,2024-10-03,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda boss Klaus Zellmer has spoken openly about car manufacturers only being able to do so much to tempt buyers into – and legislators need to do more to encourage uptake. Speaking to CAR at the reveal of the , the brand’s new compact , Zellmer said while the firm would continue to increase its electric offering, Skoda needed to be ‘flexible and cater to what customers actually want’. ‘Our task is to provide products like the Elroq to make EVs as attractive as possible, and now let’s see what legislation comes up with. We can’t change a customer’s sentiment, we can’t provide all the charging infrastructure, and we can’t provide electricity prices that favour an electric car versus an ICE car. ‘It’s something that encompasses a lot more than just car manufacturers, and this is why we are as aggressive as we are with the Elroq as we want to meet the CO2 limits and not exceed them, and now let’s see what consumers do going forward.’ The CEO’s comments were in relation to the European Union’s fleet-wide emissions targets, which are becoming more stringent in 2025. The EU is taking a different stance to the UK’s zero-emissions mandate, where a certain percentage of all cars sold need to produce no tailpipe emissions otherwise they face steep fines, but can be delayed in order to meet them. It was initially thought that the Elroq would replace the similarly-sized in Skoda’s line-up, but the two cars will now co-exist with similar dimensions, interior space and – most importantly – price. Across Europe the Karoq and Elroq will cost almost the same, and in the UK, the Elroq’s  £31,500 starting price will ‘get within £200’ of a petrol Karoq, according to a spokesperson. It makes the Elroq one of the cheapest electric SUVs in its class, undercutting the new and . ‘We are building on [Skoda’s] affordability factor. The price of the Elroq is an aggressive way of showing we can build and offer a car that’s on a high level with its ICE brother or sister car. We wanted to show it’s doable,’ said Zellmer. ‘We really want to offer cars that consumers opt in for, and it will be interesting to see how many people gravitate towards the Elroq and how many stay with the Karoq.’ The current-generation Karoq has been around since late 2017 and is now one of the oldest models in its segment, yet remains one of its most popular cars. ‘At the end of the day, consumers decide what they want to do with their money and we want to keep all doors open. The trend in the European Union at the moment is not showing the growth of BEV that we originally forecast. So we need to be flexible and cater to what customers actually want.’ Zellmer said they have ‘two to three years’ to see how the current Karoq is doing and they will then decide to do ‘another refresh or not’. ‘But we want to keep that up to customers to signal what their preference is and not what we think they should drive.’ Zellmer showed support for the UK’s ‘ZEV mandate’, adding that Skoda supported a ‘window of three years’ to meet targets, whereas they must be met in the EU by the end of December 2025. ‘It’s going to be the most fierce environment for EVs in the next year and that’s not healthy. It will destroy residuals, it will destroy customer sentiments in terms of electric car cost, because they will cost something completely different in 2026. ‘We need to try and meet a deadline that reflects what consumers really want at the minute.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
198,W1: McLaren’s new hybrid hypercar is a technological tour-de-force,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mclaren/w1/,Ben Whitworth,2024-10-06,Car Magazine UK,"This is the McLaren W1. It’s the next generation of Woking’s ‘1’ cars, and follows on from the and in the Ultimate Series. These are serious cars – vehicles at the very pinnacle of performance, technology and exclusivity. McLaren announced the W1’s debut at 1pm BST on 6 October, precisely 50 years since Emerson Fittipaldi sealed the company’s first Formula 1 Drivers’ and Constructors’ World Championship victories at the wheel of the McLaren M23. The letter W nodding to what the company calls its world championship mindset, this halo model is a £2 million trailblazer for McLaren’s path for the next decade. With a lineage that includes the Speedtail, Senna and Solus, McLaren’s knowledge banks in this niche are Wikipedia-like in size and value. Every aspect of the W1’s description-defying design is driven by the aerodynamics – the most advanced, ambitious, extreme and comprehensive McLaren has ever applied to a road car, it claims. The W1’s complex bodywork is wrapped around what McLaren calls its Aerocell, an all-new motorsport-inspired prepreg carbonfibre tub designed from scratch to bring shapeshifting aero that delivers both massive downforce and minimal drag. ‘We’ve applied F1 aero techniques to redirect air under, through and over the car,’ says Robin Algoo, the W1’s lead aerodynamicist, who has spent half of his eight years at McLaren working on the W1. The result, explains Algoo, is that high-energy airflow travels cleanly down the centre of the car. ‘Front downforce is more evenly distributed, with the centre of pressure naturally closer to the centre of gravity, making the W1 less sensitive to pitch than cars with traditional front splitters. At the back, the Active Longtail wing extends up to 300mm rearwards – rather than vertically – and swings through 29º to position the leading edge of the wing behind the diffuser trailing edge.’ Behind the passenger cell sits the MHP-8, a new 3988cc V8 that shares nothing with the M630 V6 or the M840T V8 in the . The longitudinally-mounted 90° flatplane-crank unit, designed and developed by McLaren engineers, is manufactured by long-term supplier Ricardo. The all-alloy unit features both port and direct fuel injection at 350bar of pressure, and is breathed on by a pair of twin-scroll turbochargers. The short-stroke engine revs to 9200rpm, higher than any previous road-legal McLaren, at which point it’s generating 915bhp, with 664lb ft of torque coming in from 4500rpm. With a specific output of 230bhp per litre, the MHP-8 generates 102bhp more than the Senna GTR. That’s just the V8 engine. Like the P1, the W1 is a hybrid. A lightweight power-dense 1.384kWh battery, housed in the Aerocell’s floor, feeds a radial-flux electric motor that adds 342bhp and a further 325lb ft for combined total outputs of 1258bhp and 988lb ft. ‘The W1 is the fastest-accelerating road-legal McLaren ever. It will accelerate to 60mph in 2.7 seconds, reach 124mph in 5.8 seconds and 186mph in 12.7 seconds,’ says W1 vehicle line director, Alex Gibson. ‘Top speed is electronically limited to 217mph. It will drive away from a Speedtail in a race to 185mph, and around the 6.2km handling circuit at the Nardo Proving Ground it’s three seconds a lap faster than a Senna.’ Three seconds a lap faster than a Senna… how is that even physically possible? Expect iterations of this engine and its technology to power future higher-volume road models. That monstrous power and trick aero are supported by brakes, suspension and steering engineered to maximise driver control and confidence. The steering is hydraulically powered – no rear-steer or numb electric assistance here – for an unfiltered flow of information from the front axle. The W1’s Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear forged monobloc calipers may be standard equipment at this performance level – you’ll find them on the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale, Porsche 911 GT3 RS and the Lamborghini Revuelto – but here they grab 390mm CCMR-Plus brake discs coated in an additional high-friction ceramic layer that McLaren claims will deliver both consistent braking performance and parachute-deployment levels of retardation: 124mph to standstill in 100 metres and 62mph to zero in just 29 metres. The front and rear suspension componentry wouldn’t look out of place on the walls of a modern art gallery. Snappily labelled Race Active Chassis Control III, the W1’s complex suspension uses double wishbones front and rear, inboard springs and dampers, with rear active drop links and adaptive damping. There’s titanium componentry, and a lot of 3D-printed sexiness in the wishbones and the inboard active heave damper, which significantly increases vertical stiffness under braking, improving stability and reducing corner-entry oversteer. Swing up the driver’s door – take the time to gaze at the sculpted aero intricacies of its skin, and the titanium suspension that’s on view between chassis and front wheel – and you’re faced with a yawning aperture that makes cabin entry and exit a breeze. The two bucket seats are an integral part of the Aerocell, rather than independent bolt-in units. Apart from the obvious structural benefits, this single-piece approach creates generous levels of room in all directions. The single-piece F1-style sliding pedal box and reach-rake steering wheel adjust around the fixed seats; extra padding and support are available if requested by customers. Nope, sorry. Production is pegged at 399 units, with the first customers taking delivery in early 2026. They’re all spoken for.

199,"436 miles per charge for under £45k: new Tesla Model 3 Long Range is 'most efficient EV' in UK",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/model-3/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-10-08,Car Magazine UK,"Following on from the 2024 facelift, the has received another upgrade – this time the addition of a new long-range version of the rear-wheel drive variant. Creating what Tesla says is ‘the most efficient EV available in Europe today’. Claimed capable of 436 miles per charge, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, to give it its the full and rather unimaginative title, is also said to offer the best ‘price-to-range’ ratio of any on sale in the UK. Starting at £44,990, it’s certainly cheaper than anything else on our . That 436-mile driving range is equivalent to 700km. Which means – according to Tesla – driving that far uses an equivalent amount of energy as heating 700 microwave dinners. We’re not really sure of the relevance of that either, but apparently that’s a measure of EV energy consumption now. In more sensible figures, Tesla says the LR RWD expends 20.1kWh per 100 miles. That’s 5 miles per kilowatt hour, which is very impressive. Using dedicated home Octopus Go, which costs as little as 7p per kWh, Tesla reckons 10,000 miles of driving would therefore cost approximately £140.83. Amazing, if that maths adds up in the real world. And to be clear, we will be testing the car’s real-world efficiency as soon as we’re able to – though it’s worth noting the Model 3 is already the most efficient EV we’ve ever group-tested, achieving 4 miles per kWh in . The first UK customers cars should be here in November 2024. The Tesla Model 3 has been revised for the 2024 model year – and we’ve got all the new photos and specs of the facelifted electric car. It’s the biggest change after six years and 2 million sold, underlining the importance of the smaller, cheaper Tesla. It’s now available in the UK, priced from £39,990. Deliveries for the heavily updated car – dubbed ‘Highland’ before being unveiled – began in January 2024. The Model 3 has become a common sight on UK roads, rising to be the bestselling car overall in some months. It’s clearly done its job intended by Elon Musk: to electrify the masses. Key changes for the 2024 model year are revised lamps front and rear, and a host of interior upgrades, and we’ll detail all these changes in this article. You can watch our , where road tester James Dennison drives the cheaper, smaller Tesla in London and the countryside, and gives CAR magazine’s verdict. We’ll be driving the revised 2024 Model 3 in the weeks to come. Read on for everything you need to know about the Tesla Model 3 EV. Two models initially came to the UK and Ireland in 2024: the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Long Range All-Wheel Drive. Two additional colours (Ultra Red and Stealth Grey) were added at the same time, with an updated Model 3 Performance joining a little later. You can see the latest specs and prices in the table below. Compare that to previous specs below and the range is up across the board, although speed remains unchanged. That’s partly down to the updated Model 3’s uprated aerodynamic efficiency. Most of the improvements to the Model 3 are focused around the cabin, an area where its age was beginning to show compared to the competition. Tesla engineers have introduced premium materials to the fold and updated pretty much everything in the interior: The front seats are now ventilated and all seats are heated as standard. The centre console – always a highlight of Teslas – still houses a 15.4-inch display, but thinner bezels mean there’s more usable screen area than before. The entire console is now covered in aluminium with improved storage, dual wireless phone chargers and a trio of up-to-date USB-C ports – all capable of pushing out 65W of power. Tesla has also added ambient lighting, a feature found in the majority of its competitors. Passengers at the rear haven’t been left out when it comes to tech though; an 8-inch screen will allow those in the back seats to access entertainment and other options, with further features to be added via OTA updates. A new stereo brings 17 speakers, dual subwoofers and twin amplifiers for Long Range vehicles, while basic RWD Model 3s get a single sub and amp. The infotainment supports Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal and Tesla promises better microphones for hands-free calls. Note also how there is no key: instead you use your phone, or a Tesla credit-card-sized fob, to unlock and start the car. It’s a good example of Tesla focusing on evolution, not revolution. The 2024 facelift is a modest change, emphasising everyday useability over any significant engineering step change. Tesla recently gave Model 3s with the bigger battery a firmware update which brought faster, 200kW charging capability. It means cars with the top battery can now add a theoretical 850 miles of range in just one hour – if you can find a fast enough charger, that is. The new European ultra-fast networks such as Ionity, Fastned and Allego chargers should do the job, according to Tesla.

172,Mystery Toyota GR GT3 car takes on Goodwood,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/gr-gt3/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-07-14,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota Motor Corporation is plotting an all-new supercar – and we just got our best look at it. TMC hasn’t revealed any concrete details about it at all – but that didn’t stop the Japanese brand sending not one – but two – versions of the supercar up the Goodwood hill. How’s that for a teaser campaign? Very little, but even with the camo on it’s clear these cars are related to the Toyota GR Concept revealed a few years ago. First shown at the 2022 Tokyo Auto Salon, the GR concept signalled Toyota’s future commitment to the GT3 class and doubled-down on its ‘race to road’ ethos – already shown with the GR Yaris. With that in mind, it’s likely the GT3 racecar was developed first, with the road car following in its wake. Even with the camo on, we can make out the silhouette of the new car. It looks to be a front-engined, rear-wheel drive beast in a similar ilk to that of the Mercedes-AMG GT3 that’ll eventually be tussling with. Of course, it’ll really be front-mid-engined, as you can bet Toyota’s engineers have tried to improve the CoG as much as possible. Listen to the videos and clips floating around on the internet, and it’s clearly packing a V8 under the long hood. If so, it could be one of two already existing engines: the 5.2-litre V8 engine that currently powers the Lexus RC F GT3, or the 5.0-litre V8 in the RC F road car. Of course, it could use an entirely new engine and could also operate with hybrid power in other trims. Although the styling looks to have hallmarks of Lexus, it’s clearly based on the GR Concept under the camo – which was revealed as a Toyota. The finer details are obscured in the prototypes shown at Goodwood, but we can look at the concept for an educated guess. Expect a sharp light signature, angular lines and something that’s somewhere between a Supra and LFA. Not the worst place to be. When released, we expect the race car to start alongside Toyota’s already successful Hypercar, the GR010. It’ll also see Toyota competing in WRC, both classes of Le Mans – and even with an involvement in F1 through the Haas team. We’ll update this article when we know more.

173,The S Express: Aston Martin unveils new Vantage S,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/vantage-s/,Jake Groves,2025-07-14,Car Magazine UK,"Aston Martin’s next S-branded car has landed. The new Vantage S made its first public appearance at the , and follows on from . The biggest change to the Vantage S is more power from the 4.0-litret twin-turbo V8, which now makes 672bhp – up from 656bhp from the regular Vantage. That lops 0.1sec off the 0-62mph sprint, down to 3.4sec, with the 202mph top speed remaining unchanged. Beyond that, Aston Martin has further refined the throttle mapping and fiddled with the launch control settings to bring a smoother sprint. Recalibrated Bilstein DTC adaptive dampers and tweaks to the undertray aero to improve downforce are included, too. S models stand out via red trimmings and new 21-inch wheel designs, as well as extra carbonfibre elements. A new rear wing increase downforce by 44kg, while new details at the front can manipulate the air better. It’s the same inside, with some red detailing and bespoke Alcantara seating. You can have a Vantage S as a coupe or as a roadster, with the first ones launching at the end of 2025. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

174,Denza’s masterplan for the UK: BYD’s premium trio hits Goodwood,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/denza/bono-ge/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-07-14,Car Magazine UK,"So, it’s confirmed: Denza, is coming to the UK in 2026 with three cars, the B5 4×4, the Z9 GT, and the D9 MPV. All three were on display at the , as the brand begins its PR and marketing offensive ahead of launch. To get more insight into the strategy for BYDs premium brand, we spoke Denza’s UK boss Bono Ge. ‘We are planning to launch in middle of next year,’ he says, speaking to me in Denza’s sweltering VIP area. As you’d expect, the Denza has brand one of the larger stands at this year’s festival, and it’s using it to showcase the crab-walking antics. ‘We are preparing a few products,’ he continues. ‘At the moment we have the Z9 GT, and we are working on the European version. We are working on the D9 and the two products will be available the first roughly middle of next year.’ We’ve already driven the Z9 GT, and it’s fair to say a fair amount of localisation work will need to take place. Chinese market cars tend to come off as ‘floaty’ and relatively soft compared to the western variants, and that was certainly the case when we drove the Z9 GT in hybrid form (it’s available as an EV, too). It’s all down to variables like driver behaviour and road conditions, but it’s something Denza is already at work to fix. It’s also something the likes of Jaecoo and Omoda also must contend with. That’s one of the reasons why they’re considering an R&D site in the UK. The Z9 GT will launch alongside the D9 MPV (shown above), a vehicle class that seems to be enjoying a resurgence. ‘If you look at the market data, the MPV is not really high in the UK. But now MPV in China are getting very, very popular.’ Denza believes the same thing will happen in the UK. It’s a view shared by , who is also planning to release the X9 MPV in the UK later, too. It’ll be coming to Europe in PHEV form, though it’s also available as an EV in China. Next on the scene is the B5, a car not marketed as a Denza globally. In other markets it’s badged as yet another BYD brand – this time an off-road specialist called Fangchengbao. In the UK, however, the B5 will be the third Denza car. ‘We’ll try to get ready hopefully in Q3,’ Ge tells me. ‘With the Z9, we only get a car, so we need SUV, right? We to combine two brands in Europe, making them one brand, so we can get an SUV. We’ll also get an MPV. We can do more things.’ The B5 will be offered as a hybrid-only. We all get tired of brands bringing electric SUVs to market – but it’s always surprising when they opt for something else. After all, electric SUVs have been a huge growth area for the last few years. With that in mind, I ask Ge why they’ve gone for such a varied line up: an MPV, wagon and 4×4. ‘It stands for technology drives elegance,’ says Ge. For Denza and BYD, the trio picked out represents the best of BYD’s technology and reaches for every extreme of the market. It’s a good way to cover more ground, quickly. Zoom in closer and you’ll find other interesting decisions. The Z9 GT comes in both saloon and wagon in other markets, but Denza is only bringing the GT to the UK: ‘That’s where European product team made a study,’ he explains. ‘We believe the GT version is more suited to this market. You know, the pure sedan market share is not huge, right?’ Denza will arrive next year with all the intelligence already gathered from BYD, so it’ll have a better idea of UK customers. ‘BYD will help us know more about the UK customer’s thinking and the European customer’s thinking.’ Ge says. ‘UK customers are really open minded, and they really like to try new technologies.’ That’ll be useful for Denza, who is pushing its superior technology over its premium competitors. ‘We should attract customers from Mercedes, BMW but also some customers from Porsche,’ says Ge. However, he also acknowledges other areas Denza will need to work on to deliver a truly premium experience: ‘You need to focus on a lot of details and try to make the customer journey smoother.’ Next, read what BYD boss said about Denza on its brand launch in early 2025.

175,New CLA Shooting Brake is Mercedes’ first electric estate,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/cla-shooting-brake/,Jake Groves,2025-07-15,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-Benz has launched its new CLA Shooting Brake – its first electric estate – to accompany its . The small estate is the second car to launch on Merc’s new MMA platform, with new SUVs to come. As well as promising more usable space inside than the saloon, Mercedes says the new CLA Shooting Brake is capable of massive range figures for the EQ Technology-branded electric version that launches first. Like the CLA saloon, the Shooting Brake will also benefit from new hybrid engines that will launch at a later date. Little has changed beyond the body style morphing, with the new CLA Shooting Brake still featuring the CLA’s rather grumpy face and three-pointed star details in the lights, as well as a chintzy light-up grille. The biggest focus, design-wise, for the new Shooting Brake is its stretched rear end that allows for a larger boot – one that’s 50 litres bigger than the CLA saloon. On top of that, Mercedes claims you can use the 101-litre frunk and incorporated roof rails to boost how much you can carry. All of the tech beneath the bodywork is the same as the CLA saloon, including that new Mercedes Modular Architecture platform. Two variants will arrive at launch: the CLA 250+ and 350 4Matic. Both use an 85kWh battery pack and can be charged at up to 320kW on DC charging (although will be incompatible with many 400-volt DC chargers in the UK, annoyingly). The 250+ version uses a single 268bhp e-motor, sprinting to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and topping out at 130mph. Mercedes claims a 473-mile max e-range via WLTP testing. Choose the pokier 350 4Matic version and you’ll benefit from two e-motors generating 349bhp, good for a 5.0sec 0-62mph sprint and a slightly smaller claimed max range of 454 miles. Not bothered by an EV? Like the CLA saloon, you’ll be able to choose from a non-plug-in hybrid model at a later date. Just like the CLA saloon, the Shooting Brake features a new version of MBUX inside that massively improves the amount of connectivity on offer, with Mercedes including features like an AI assistant and a much more expanded app store. The new CLA Shooting Brake launches in March 2026. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

176,McLaren Project Endurance: the WEC hypercar you can own,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mclaren/wec-hypercar/,Jake Groves,2025-07-15,Car Magazine UK,"McLaren has already confirmed that it plans to enter the top class of the World Endurance Championship, and now you can own an endurance racer. We’ve been up close with the ‘customer’ car at the . As part of Project Endurance, where McLaren is getting itself involved with top tier endurance racing again, it’s also producing a set of track-only versions that clients can buy and own. Of course, that idea comes with quite a few caveats – with the largest being you’d need to be a billionaire to even get close to one, and McLaren needs to keep a hold of it for the first two years. ‘The top of the car is still produced under LMDh regulations,’ Neil Underwood, head of HyperTrack cars at McLaren, tells us. ‘And then what we’ve done after is incorporate , like the Performance Line down the side similar to McLaren’s CanAm cars. The DRLs – those vertical lights – are the same on the front and the rear of the Sabre [a limited-run, US-only hypercar], and the rear section is very much like the P1.’ Like the endurance racer, the client version features an electrified 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 powertrain that Underwood says has been specifically developed for Project Endurance, driving the rear wheels with endurance race-spec engineering. ‘There’s also a seven-speed sequential Xtrac gearbox, as well as all the right bits to make it go faster,’ smiles Underwood. Naturally, there’s a significantly detailed onboarding process for those lucky enough to get access to their own Project Endurance car. ‘Clients will get simulator sessions, a seat fitted for the car, as well as lots of ‘money can’t buy’ experiences,’ says Underwood. ‘You’re in the development as it happens, too. The difference between ours and the Ferrari or Aston Martin programme, for example, is that we’ll really take you behind the scenes. They’ll come to the first test with us and experience what a pro driver will.’ Part of that programme is also choosing a livery or paint scheme. ‘You can choose from a number of liveries, as we’re not doing an MSO programme on this,’ says Underwood. ‘The car will come in raw carbon, then you choose a livery which will be in vinyl. If you want your car painted, that’d be an additional process but it’s possible.’ For the first two years, McLaren keeps custody of the car itself due to the super exclusive battery technology used. After that, the batteries are replaced. ‘After the two years, you can then take the car and run it yourself with a new battery programme, or we can keep running it through our McLaren Pure programme,’ says Underwood. McLaren already races in the GT series with a 720S, but McLaren Racing recently confirmed its return to WEC. The team it’ll be partnering with United Autosports (co-owned by Zak Brown) to come back to the top class of prototype endurance racing. Details are thin on the ground, but the racer will compete with the LMDh rules like Porsche – rather than the bespoke Hypercar rules Peugeot and Ferrari adhere to. McLaren will also be using a Dallara chassis, and will pair it with a twin-turbocharged V6 with hybrid assistance. ‘McLaren Racing’s return to the FIA World Endurance Championship marks the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for us,’ said McLaren Racing’s CEO Zak Brown. ‘We have a rich history in the sport together with McLaren Automotive, having raced and won on our first attempt at Le Mans in 1995. This customer programme will offer buyers an incredible chance to own an authentic race car and get closer to the action on track.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

177,Car design is in a crisis,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/car-design-in-crisis/,Stephen Bayley,2025-07-16,Car Magazine UK,"Saturn ate his own children. The motor industry does the same, except it also regurgitates them. When Volkswagen took-over Navistar (which was formerly International Harvester), it inadvertently acquired the “Scout” nameplate. Scout was a utility vehicle made by International Harvester between 1961 and 1980. The concept was “replace the horse”, but a slow cart-horse rather than the fast race-horse which Henry Ford believed his own customers yearned for. Designer Ted Ornas created what was essentially a Jeep with softer, more friendly contours. Scout had understated, clean, modern lines and was – you could say – the first SUV. But it did not excite an ungovernable frenzy of consumer hysteria. Nor will Volkswagen’s new Scout EV. Car design is in a crisis. The rich vein of elegance that once informed the Italians has been all but exhausted. Today’s BMWs look like the result of an anarchic game of consequences, not rational German thought. Mercedes’ product-planning seems wholly randomised. French cars have lost their charm. And of American design, all you need is think Cybertruck. To explain, we need the Soviet economist, Nikolai Kondratiev. He had a theory that all economic, and, indeed, cultural activity followed a sinusoidal pattern of peaks and troughs, often inspired by the discovery of new energy sources. The theory became known as Kondratiev’s Waves. Alas for poor Nikolai, he was unable to predict his own fall-out with Stalin and was confined to a gulag. Electricity is that new energy source and dominates discussion of car design today. But this discussion began at precisely the time that we became fearful of the future. This is why designers are plundering their memory palaces and Ford gives us re-issues of Bronco, Mustang and Capri, feeble travesties of the gutsy originals which cynically exploit consumer nostalgia in the absence of having anything to say for themselves. Ditto electric R5, Volkswagen ID-Buzz. You name it. This is what I mean by a trough. The conversation about electricity as an intelligent power source is for another day, but there is no debate that electric cars are less interesting than combustion cars. A combustion engine has thousands of different parameters of noise, heat, vibration, smell. Electric has fewer. A big twelve cylinder demands a monumental Packard. A small air-cooled twin just has to be in something as cute as a cinquecento or a 2cv. The Scout EV is a demonstration of doubt on an industrial scale, the latest car to plunder the past in a process begun by J Mays’ 1991 Audi Avus concept which cleverly played with ghosts of Hitler’s Auto Unions. Mays (who also rebirthed the Beetle and the Thunderbird) called this “Retrofuturism”, the title of an exhibition of his work shown at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2002. The year before, BMW had re-imagined the Mini. At the time I was visiting Walter de Silva at Audi in Ingolstadt and – despairingly – he put his head in his hands and said “Repetizione! Repetizione!” The Scout EV is another repetition and the more depressing because it repeats an original that was, unlike, say, the Thunderbird or Mini, not that exciting in the first place. At least the first generation of electric cars, the ur-Prius and Honda Element, were courageously odd, making explicit their whack-job outlier status. If electricity becomes the norm, then car design will be progressively infantilized. Actually, I see it as becoming no more interesting than Hot Wheels : with motive power and drive systems all similar, designers will gussy-up platforms with ever more playful parodies of the past. Good food should taste of what it is. Good design should express fundamental truths about the product. Instead, the Scout EV is an unpalatable fiction …. like tofu made to taste like steak. But let’s get back to the Waves. Like Kondratiev, I might be wrong. There’s a condition that psychologists call apophenia which means an inclination to see connections between unrelated things. Maybe I am apophenic. Perhaps electricity and retrophilia are unrelated. On the other hand, if Kondratiev was right, when hydrogen arrives, design will soon be out of its trough and back to its peak. Meanwhile, I’ll tell you one thing of which I am certain : no-one, not even the most demented retromaniac, will be reviving the Scout EV."
178,The agitator in chief: next-gen MG 4 EV looms over the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/4-ev-hatchback/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-07-17,Car Magazine UK,"MG is the original disruptor of the 21 century automotive industry. It created the formula for Chinese brands to breach Europe. It accelerated a shift towards affordable with its aggressive pricing. And now, it’s ripping up traditional manufacturer model cycles because, just three years into the current car’s lifespan, it’s replacing the . Most manufacturers keep their cars around for six or seven years to try and make as much money from their initial investment as possible. To western business minds, MG’s decision to replace the 4 EV twice as quickly is unthinkable – especially upon learning how extensive the model change is. David Allison, MG’s head of product and planning, broke the news to me at the 2025 , hinting that his engineers were already working on a new MG 4 that’ll arrive on UK shores 2028 (which is when the current car should be replaced, if we’re following conventional logic). After a bit of digging around on MG’s Chinese media sites, I think I’ve found the car that’ll receive the torch. It’s already on sale in China. It’s also the right size for the European C-segment, it’s based on a new platform, it has a completely new body, an updated interior and a fresh infotainment system with more connectivity features. So, while MG hasn’t yet confirmed we’ll get this exact car, I think it’s a safe bet. Allison provided an explanation for this seemingly reckless strategy. He said: ‘one of the things that’s important is when you sell a car, or when someone’s gone through their two- or three-year life cycle, is you’ve got something to offer them when they come back. ‘And sometimes maybe a facelift – a slightly different front end or an interior, particularly given how quickly EV moves – maybe isn’t enough. I think that may be more important from an EV point of view, perhaps, than a combustion engine or electrified combustion engine point of view.’ He added: ‘we’ve got very used, in this industry, to a model lifespan of five, six, seven years. Launch, facelift after three, replace after six. I think those days are over. I really do. I don’t think [with] the way that China evolves, they wouldn’t think twice about developing a car and completely ripping it up and starting again in two- or three-years’ time. ‘So, I wouldn’t be surprised – I’m not saying that’s going to necessarily happen to us and it’s going to happen immediately – but I can absolutely see that happening in the future. That very, very quick product cycle. And almost thinking that, by the time we’ve got a new car into market, we’re not working on the facelift, we’re working on the replacement.’ As mad as MG’s reasoning might seem, I reckon it’s actually quite a smart move. MG is under a lot of pressure right now from both incoming rival Chinese brands and more established European manufacturers who’ve figured out how to make their EVs cheaper. Plus, MG’s growth has started to stagnate. Back in 2022, the brand enjoyed a whopping 59% increase in sales, but that had tumbled to a mere two percent by the time 2024 rolled around. For 2025, MG is only expecting a two or three percent increase. That means it’s now all about customer retention for MG – and if the brand can offer those customers exiting a three-year lease one of the newest and shiniest cars on the market, it stands a better chance of batting away brands like BYD, who have exploded onto the UK with a relentless barrage of fresh metal. It’s notoriously difficult to get information out of China, but Allison offered some insight. ‘For that kind of car,’ he said, ‘operating in the space that it operates in, you don’t necessarily need to change. ‘You probably just need to make it charge a bit faster, go a bit further, make it more efficient, make sure that the technology is upgraded from an infotainment point of view, it’s less aggressive in its lane keep assist and all that kind of stuff. And to a lot of people, that would be okay.’ Which is basically this everything this little purple hatchback has achieved. There are also rumours floating around Chinese automotive websites (such as ) that the new MG 4 EV will feature some form of semi-solid-state battery. That stands to reduce the car’s weight, improve energy density and reduce the likelihood of combustion in an accident – a feature that’s held in high esteem amongst Chinese car buyers. MG has also collaborated with the smartphone manufacturer OPPO on the MG 4’s infotainment system. Apparently, the tie-in will make it to make it simpler to plumb your mobile into the car’s touchscreen and provide easier access to in-car apps. MG hasn’t told us that yet, but there’s every chance it could be a little cheaper than the car it replaces. I quizzed Allison about whether the cost of redeveloping the MG 4 EV would be passed onto the consumer, to which he said: ‘Not necessarily, because the next platform might be a cheaper platform to develop. ‘If you think about it, when we introduced MG 4 in 2022, we weren’t operating at anywhere near the level we’re operating today in terms of global volume. And the way that car companies can bring costs down is just through volume. The more cars you sell, the cheaper you can buy your components from your suppliers. It’s all about scale. ‘Take MG S5 that we launched in March. It was £2,000 cheaper than the car it replaced. It’s £2,500 more expensive than an equivalent MG4 for a car that’s bigger, goes further, has a much nicer interior. Okay, it might not be as sporty to drive because of the SUV body style, but it’s a really, really nice car.’ Hopefully my bet pays off. Stay tuned to find out whether I end up in the red or the black. The current MG 4 EV was most recently updated in 2023, with the launch of 400bhp-plus XPower performance model. It broke cover at the after an accidental leak by several MG dealers. It’s still on sale, with a starting price of £36,495. ‘We’re confident the MG4 XPower will shake-up the market like the MG4 SE and Trophy, showing that a compact EV can be affordable, practical and a terrific drive,’ said Guy Pigounakis, Commercial Director at MG Motor UK. ‘We expect it will appeal to customers looking for a pure performance offering which is the antithesis of the traditionally ‘loud’ high performance hatchback. The XPower also retains the generous technology and equipment levels, as well as practical hatchback features, of the award-winning MG4 range.’ MG engineers have packed not one but two motors into the MG 4’s capable chassis, and the numbers speak for themselves. The MG 4 XPower can muster 429bhp and 442lb ft of torque – all for a 0-62mph time of just 3.8 seconds. The car is based on the MG 4’s Modular Scalable Platform (MSP). To cope with the increased power, the XPower gets a locking electronic differential and torque vectoring. There are also a range of suspension upgrades including stiffer anti-roll bars, quicker steering and 25% stiffer springs. Aside from its huge performance increase, there isn’t much to differentiate the XPower from the standard 4. The brand says it wants this model to fly under the radar. All you get is an XPower badge, a two-tone roof and 18-inch alloys. You’re getting more than double the horsepower of the cheaper MG 4 SE and MG 4 SE Long Range models, which have 168bhp and 200bhp respectively. It also offers a significant performance jump over the 242bhp Trophy Extended Range version. However, the XPower might not be the one to go for if you need to cover long distances. Trophy Extended Range cars have the biggest battery packs at 77kWh, while the XPower is lumbered with MG’s 64kWh Long Range battery. It saves weight and improves performance, but maximum range is only 248 miles. The Extended Range model, meanwhile, has a maximum claimed range of 329 miles. And we never felt short changed with the amount of power that car offered.

179,Why Bentley's new boss isn't here to play it safe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bentley/frank-steffen-walliser/,Ben Miller,2025-07-18,Car Magazine UK,"Nearly 30 years a Porsche man, Frank-Steffen Walliser is now steering Bentley as CEO and chairman. Fluent in future powertrains and platforms and plugged into Wolfsburg’s decision-making apparatus, it’s not hard to see how the man behind the 918 Spyder bagged the job. Behind us, the picture-perfect Swiss mountain resort we left five minutes ago continues to free-falls into our recent past, the not inconsiderable speed with which we sweep around each hairpin taking us further from Andermatt and closer to the heavens. Ahead, the sashaying mountain road – smooth, empty, dry and set in a landscape so dizzyingly vast and beautiful I’m not sure whether to laugh or cry – is doing a decent impression of perfection. And next to me, suede-rimmed wheel in his hands, accelerator pedal very much under his right foot, new-ish Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser is talking, chuckling, driving and trying (but mostly failing) to summon some a suitably sombre tone as we discuss the demise of Bentley’s W12 engine. (We’re in the new flagship Continental GT Speed, which has filled the W12-shaped vacuum in its nose with a V8 plug-in hybrid powertrain of significant potency.) ‘Looking at the competitors, yes, they made different decisions, saying they are going to stay [with their flagship engines; Aston Martin has heavily revised its twin-turbo V12 for the new Vanquish, and Ferrari and Lamborghini will retain their V12s for the foreseeable]. But driving our alternative is extremely good.’ It’s at this point, perhaps for emphasis, that Frank flexes his ankle, filling the cosy cabin with sumptuous V8 racket and firing the Conti up the road like a wet bar of soap squeezed with both hands. ‘I have a W12 company car, a [previous-generation] Continental GT,’ he continues. ‘The engine is nice, it’s unique and it’s amazing from a technical perspective. But do I miss it? Yes, for the heritage and the engineering. But on the road, this is perfect.’ It’s hard to argue. Next question. I’ve long been curious and, well, I’m 99% sure this is the moment: that I’ll never get a better chance than right now to try to try to understand the inner workings of the labyrinthine VW Group. Specifically, how it decides which of its tech- and investment-hungry brands gets the really good stuff. Is it like Dragons’ Den, perhaps? Brand bosses and CTOs shuffling in, nervously making their case and, on a good day, leaving with three-chamber air suspension? Or is it more Gladiator: a secret coliseum somewhere in Wolfsburg from which the victor emerges, bloodied but clutching an electronic limited-slip diff? ‘Ah, now, this is maybe one of the secrets of the Volkswagen Group – and if I’m being honest, I’m still looking for the answer.’ Frank’s being coy, of course. This is the man behind Porsche’s remarkable 918 Spyder, a car that conquered so much fresh territory technically it must have run out of flags to plant, not to mention the mid-engined 911 RSR racecar and the new ‘T-Hybrid’ GTS 911. If anyone knows how to get the good stuff it’s Frank. ‘The question is good, and when I think about it part of the answer is definitely your network; the people you know. There’s no general decision board saying, “Right, this technology goes there, this goes here…” If you have a trustful relationship and know where the decisions made you can look into the cycle plans, you know the guys, and you can figure out what you can take. But then you have to be open-minded because in engineering, when you see an early prototype, honestly the experience is normally not good. It’s still to be developed and refined. So you have to judge, “Okay, this would fit our car?” And if you’re not convinced you have to think, “Is it the state of the R&D that is not convincing or the is it the technology itself?” It certainly won’t be right for Bentley at that stage, so you must look at the potential.’ There it is, then: proof, were it needed, that networks are as vitally important within the Byzantine VW Group as they are without it. And when Frank explains the transformative couple of months that plucked him from Porsche, which he joined more nearly three decades ago, and shifted him to Crewe, you get the sense his network is formidable. ‘Everything was at short notice,’ he insists. ‘I’d had some general talks before about what the future might look like. After working for some years, as I have, you have some connections in the Group. You exchange ideas and talk to people, and I’d already driven some Bentley vehicles in my previous role [the business car-busting vice president complete vehicle architecture and characteristics at Porsche]. At the end of March I got the call, asking if I would be interested. I spoke to my wife, we got on a plane and we drove around a bit in a rental car, everything undercover. I made the decision on my side, and then for sure you have to go through the Group. But I’ve had a very good connection with [VW Group CEO and Porsche CEO] Oliver Blume for many years, so that was not the question. He was in favour. And the driving force behind it was Gernot Döllner at Audi. He is also a long-time friend – we started at same time, and we’ve always been close. We did a lot of things in parallel, always challenging each other. On the 918 he did the technical concept and the show car, then handed it over to me. We sometimes discuss which was the more difficult part…’ Frank’s first day as CEO and chairman of Bentley was July 1 2024. And what a time to join. The full extent of Volkswagen’s financial pain is global news and eye-watering. Audi, too, is in the teeth of a storm. Electrification – not long ago a bandwagon at which everyone was launching themselves – appears now to be a particularly nasty combination of brutally expensive investment and limited return, certainly in the short term. And all the while shifting, wildly inconsistent global legislation adds yet another layer of hideous complication. Is this the time to be putting a guy with no prior CEO experience in charge of Bentley? ‘If you look at the job I did on the 918 Spyder, it was really more than one job. I was also looking after the complete vehicle: purchasing, production, customer relation, sales, marketing efforts. It was not only the engineering. And that was really exciting. Yes, there was a certain complexity. But it was a lot of fun making the decisions to deliver the car to customers. It was everything right up until the moment when you hand over the key to the customer, saying, “Now it’s finished, and you can drive it.” It’s an unbelievable thrill, and really you have to keep this moment always in mind during a project – the original concept of the car and that moment when you will hand over the key and say, “What do you think?” ‘It’s the same when I ran the motorsport department [between 2014 and 2019]. We had the racing team but we were also responsible for all the road-legal GT cars [Frank owns a 991 911 GT3 Touring], the engineering, motorsports for the customer racing, our own sales organisation, marketing, the Carrera Cups… I always considered this a small company inside the company, and this was how we ran it. ‘For me Bentley is kind of an extension of this, and what really thrills me the most is having this mixture of technical stuff but also marketing, the brand, communication, customer contacts, production, aftersales – the full picture. How many car brands are there in the world? Maybe 100, without the Chinese? And how often do you get the chance to run one? Obviously, Bentley is not mine. But that sense of responsibility really appealed to me; it really excites me.’ The current line-up (the Conti GT 2+2, the Flying Spur and two Bentayga variants) excites him too, not least because of the potential still to be tapped. ‘The current offering is very strong. I think in many ways, from a driving perspective the Bentayga is underrated. I just drove it again on the roads of north Wales, with some of the competitors, and it is very, very good. But while I understand the background and why certain decisions were made – and I definitely do not blame anyone – the last update of the car [which arrived in 2020, and comprised detail changes to the suspension and cockpit, together with an exterior refresh which didn’t look as extensive as it was] did not push it as far as it could have done.’ You sense Bentley’s failure to tap the rapidly expanding luxury SUV market quite as hard as it may have done gnaws at Frank. ‘Definitely there is more potential in the SUV. The Bentayga kind of defined this segment [we’d had sporty, premium SUVs before. But the Bentley blazed a trail for the likes of the DBX, the Cullinan, the Urus and the Purosangue], as the Continental GT did before it. The segment is growing tremendously and we have not benefitted from that as much as we could have done, for different reasons.’ The first EV should help, now confirmed as a ‘luxury urban SUV’, due 2026. Bentley claims the new car, which won’t replace any of the brand’s existing models but complement them, is the first ‘true luxury urban SUV’ – though precisely what makes it more urban than any other luxury electric SUV remains to be seen. An uplift in comfort is promised, together with a level of agility beyond the current plug-in hybrid and combustion-engined line-up. ‘It will be a little bit more compact, for a Bentley I must add – under 5 metres in length [the Macan is 4.7; the Bentayga 5.1-5.3] and easier to drive in urban areas,’ he explains. ‘It will be super-versatile and you will be able to use it for both long range and for the city. We want to attract new customers – there is not a lot of electric demand among today’s Bentley customers – and we think this vehicle will help us do this. Optimising travel time is not just about range. We will have incredible fast charging and the range will fit all the needs of our customers.’ The new car is part of a prudent re-engineering of Bentley’s initially hyper-aggressive electrification timeline. The original plan, announced in January 2022, was to launch five EVs between 2025 and 2030 – the so-called ‘Five-in-Five plan’ – in an ambitious £2.5bn push to establish Bentley as a leader in sustainable luxury. The brand’s ‘all-electric by 2030’ intention has also been revised, to 2035. We’ll see a new model every year between 2026 and 2035 but the rollout will comprise PHEVs as well as EVs. Bentley’s also not done with purely combustion-engined cars, hinting at a hot Bentayga in 2025. ‘The first electric Bentley will be 2026, on sale 2027,’ confirms Frank. ‘This is the part of the strategy we have been concentrating on since I arrived. Things could still change. We have five-year cycles, and when you look back five years from now, to 2019, pre-Covid, the picture was completely different.’ As is consistently the case at the moment it’s weak customer demand that’s prompted Crewe’s re-think, rather than any serious technical, production or financial challenge. ‘You can only sell it if your customer is convinced; you cannot push it. For sure it also depends a lot on the regulators, the political and tax boundary conditions. But the luxury car it is not something you buy to go from A to B. They are outside of tax optimisation, and realistically you cannot ask for a tax reduction on luxury cars. So, this is a real market. It is not driven from the outside. I would say what we’re seeing in the [electric] market at the moment is a dip. Electric demand will come back, at different speeds in different categories and in different countries, and we will be prepared for that. When we arrive with our first BEV in 2026/2027 it will coincide with a second wave of customer acceptance.’ Just as Frank’s spider’s web of a network stands Bentley in good stead for the coming years, so too will his familiarity with the platforms around which it will create its next decade of new models. The urban SUV will ride on an advanced version of the PPE platform already in use in/underneath Porsche’s electric Macan and Audi’s Q6 e-tron and new A6. Put it to him that the prospect of a Bentley that feels and drives like any of the above doesn’t feel right and he smiles a weary smile. ‘The question is always: “What is the platform?” But really there are so many variants, and this makes sense when you have the requirements of so many different brands. Software also has a huge impact. Has Crewe been influencing the design of PPE for years? It’s more like “What can we take?” We can do whatever we want; whatever is appropriate for the brand. We just need a platform that gives us a good base on battery power, charging speed, the electrical architecture and software. ‘This is where I think sometimes Bentley is misjudged. It is also a technology company – we’re handling all this stuff. It’s not only stitching and leather and nice interiors, and I’ve not seen many [other luxury car companies] in the world capable of doing this to this level. Honestly, no one. It is not just a carryover platform. The engineering job is way bigger – to bring a Bentley-ness to every part of the platform, even where you cannot see it. This is very important, so that we are unique.’ Will Frank’s Bentleys feel different to drive? After all, you’ll find his fingerprints on many of the most celebrated Porsche sports cars of the last 20 years. There’s also something of a contradiction at the heart of the brand, isn’t there? On one hand Bentley has this incredible heritage – the Bentley boys, Le Mans, Pikes Peak, GT3 racing – and, on the new Speed, very Porsche-esque tech such as rear-wheel steering and electronic differentials. But you sense too that an awful lot of Bentley customers just want a very quiet, comfortable and luxurious motor car. ‘This is an interesting point, and one I’m discussing with the engineering team more or less every day. I would say ‘comfort’ is too generic. “Effortless” describes it way better, so the car is easy to handle. You notice it too when you drive the heritage cars. I’m convinced that if a car is really driving properly, with top steering feel, throttle response and great brake pedal feel, this is all part of effortless, regardless of how you drive. I also don’t believe that to be comfortable you have to be soft. A car that is soggy is not good to drive because it demands more of your attention. It’s a like a good racecar. A car is usually fastest, certainly in terms of repeatable performance, when it is the easiest to drive, because the driver is less distracted and more confident.’ Talking of racecars… ‘Are there motorsport plans? No, not at the moment. Would racing again fit with the brand? Absolutely yes. In terms of the World Endurance Championship it would help if they could agree a single set of regulations. But right now it is not a top priority. It is the same with a Bentley sports car. I would like to do it but it is not the priority. We also have to work out what exactly it might be; a sports car, a super performance car, or is it something else again?’ For now, the success of sports cars and motorsports, with which Frank forged his reputation, must take a back seat. It’s as a strategist, engineer and arch networker that Bentley needs him to shine. As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy. One of the team who's just as happy on two wheels as four."
180,Subaru confirms new Uncharted electric crossover for Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/subaru/uncharted/,Jake Groves,2025-07-18,Car Magazine UK,"Subaru has confirmed its next car for Europe: the Uncharted. It is – rather unsurprisingly – an electric crossover based off a Toyota. Specifically, the Uncharted has close ties to the new – the battery electric version of Toyota’s own mid-size-ish crossover. The Uncharted is, according to Subaru, ‘the brand’s first all-electric compact SUV’ that is ’designed for outdoor-loving explorers and performance enthusiasts alike.’ And, as much as Subaru has worked closely with Toyota, the bodywork is all Subaru’s own design. Inside, the Uncharted includes a large 14-inch infotainment screen and dual wireless chargers, as well as a broadly similar interior design as the C-HR+. Three powertrain options will be offered. A base model with a 57.7kWh battery pack, a single e-motor and a claimed range of 276 miles. A larger 77kWh battery option is offered with either a single e-motor and a 363-mile claimed range, or a dual-motor all-wheel drive version that can sprint to 62mph in five seconds and claims a 292-mile range. Subaru’s rollout of EVs continues, after the that launched a few years back. As well as the Uncharted, Subaru has confirmed that the E-Outback will come to Europe. We’ll find out more specific speca when the car launches early in 2026. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

181,Aston Martin reveals its motorsport-spec Valkyrie targeting Le Mans and IMSA victories,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/valkyrie-amr-lmh/,Colin Overland,2025-02-05,Car Magazine UK,"This is the racing version , which will be competing at this summer’s Le Mans 24 Hours and in the whole World Endurance Championship and US IMSA series this year, kicking off with WEC round one in Qatar at the end of February. Adam Carter, Aston’s head of endurance motorsport, says: ‘For people who’ve grown up in racing, going racing with Aston Martin is a great privilege. To be able to do it with the Valkyrie, at a time when sportscar racing is in a golden era of manufacturer interest, is a great opportunity, the stars aligning.’ The Valkyrie is the only car in the Hypercar class that’s derived from a road-legal car, and the only V12. It keeps the Cosworth-built 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 engine, but loses the limited-edition road car’s hybrid assistance, as that adds weight and contributes more power than WEC rules allow to be used. The racer makes about 670bhp, against the road car’s 100bhp-plus, with valvetrain revisions giving a smoother torque delivery. It’s competing for overall victory against a packed field that includes 2024 winners Ferrari, previously dominant Toyota, and works-backed cars from Peugeot, Alpine, Cadillac, Porsche and BMW. Genesis has said it’s joining the series in 2026, and Ford has announced it plans to join in 2027. Aston Martin will run two Valkyries in WEC (pictured in green) and one in the IMSA series (in blue, which now uses the same regulations as WEC). The WEC cars will be driven by Marco Sorensen, Alex Riberas and Brits Tom Gamble and Harry Tincknell. The US car is in the experienced hands of Ross Gunn and Roman de Angelis. All three cars will take part in the high-profile Le Mans race, which Aston has been involved with since 1928. In recent years its main success has been in the GT3 class. This year will be a serious attempt to nab its first overall victory since 1959. Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark says: ‘The Valkyrie is an embodiment of our enduring sporting ethos, one that has defined the brand for more than a century.’ The roadgoing Valkyrie was in large part the work of Adrian Newey. He’s now with Aston Martin’s F1 team, but hasn’t been directly involved in the Le Mans project. Various details have been tweaked to adhere to racing rules and to make it better suited to the demands of 24-hour racing – the aerodynamics, for instance, are no longer active, but the underbody has remained close to the road car’s. The big change is removing the hybrid element from the V12 engine. Carter says that in race form the engine will not be working so hard as it does in road spec, which should help with reliability, durability and fuel efficiency. He says: ‘Running lean to reduce the amount of fuel you are carrying to deliver the required stint energy is important. We operate the engine slower than it’s capable of because we require less power. The lower power limit within the regulations creates an opportunity for us to revisit the torque curve and reduce the frictional losses by reducing engine speed to increase fuel efficiency.’ He adds: ‘You learn every time you go to the racetrack. Feeding that learning back into Aston Martin is an important part of what we do.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
182,Government moves to bring petrol and diesel car ban back to 2030,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/uk-hybrid-petrol-diesel-ban/,Ted Welford,2025-01-07,Car Magazine UK,"The government has opened a consultation into banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, reversing the earlier 2035 date implemented by the previous Conservative government. In a written statement to Parliament, transport minister Heidi Alexander said Labour wanted to ‘restore clarity’ for the automotive industry after the ‘previous government had caused significant harm’ by moving the date of the ban from 2035 to 2030. Alexander, MP for Swindon South, said: “This consultation marks a new phase of collaboration between the government and the automotive and charging sectors as we support and work together with industry to grasp the opportunities of this ambitious and transformative shift – ensuring the prosperity and security of our nation, with higher growth, better jobs, and cheaper bills. This transformation is a challenge we can meet by working together.” Let’s take a look at what we know so far. As part of this government consultation, it says it is an opportunity for the industry to express their preferences on the ‘types of vehicles permitted between 2030 and 2035 alongside EVs’. But by 2035 it says ‘all new cars and vans will need to be 100 per cent zero emissions’. What this means is that you won’t be able to buy a new conventional petrol or diesel car without any hybrid assistance, but some hybrid vehicles might be permitted after this date until 2035. That said, the statement contains no mention of hybrid vehicles, so it’s unknown what type of hybrid, if any, the government will allow to be sold between 2030 and 2035. Clarity is desperately needed here for the industry. It was known that Labour was looking to bring forward the petrol and diesel car ban, and this letter to parliament, now brings further certainty that it is their intention. The statement makes it clear that it wants to offer clarity to the industry, which is in a state of flux as it works to bring EVs to market that customers don’t necessarily want to buy, in order to meet targets. While the industry will welcome certainty when the consultation comes to a close and a decision is made, it continues to leave key UK automotive manufacturers in limbo. Toyota’s factory in Burnaston, Derbyshire, exclusively makes self-charging hybrid models with its Corolla, and it’s yet to announce any plans to begin producing EVs. Nissan’s Sunderland plant, the largest car manufacturing facility in the UK, primarily produces petrol and hybrid models with its Juke and Qashqai, though has committed to a significant redevelopment of its factories in the North East to make electric cars. But the confirmation that Labour wants to move to the 2030 petrol and diesel van date brings further confirmation that is all but guaranteed. Top bosses at the automotive group have long called for clarity from government, both past and present. As well as looking at the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, this consultation also looks at the controversial , which requires manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of EVs, otherwise they face steep fines for not complying. Each manufacturer was required to hit a 22 per cent share of their new car sales to be electric in 2024 – a figure that only 36 per cent of manufacturers achieved last year. Of the 10 biggest car brands in the UK, only three managed to achieve a 22 per cent share, while others (such as Ford and Toyota with only an eight per cent EV) share languished far behind. Despite this, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said that it’s ““confident the whole market has complied” and “no manufacturer will need to pay fines” because of the flexibilities built into the scheme. The government is now seeking views from the industry on the existing flexibilities to the ZEV mandate and what else can be charged. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."

The new EV9 GT has been revealed at the 2024 LA Auto Show. The three-row SUV, Kia’s largest model, now benefits from 501bhp from two electric motors and a ‘targeted’ 0-60mph time of 4.3 seconds. More powerful brakes as standard will help it come to a stop once you’ve stopped scaring your young ones on the school run. On top of that, Kia is applying its ‘electronically controlled suspension’ for the first time to an SUV. It’s linked to the drive mode system, firming up the ride or slackening it off. Other performance tech includes an electronic limited-slip differential, and Kia has applied ‘virtual gear shift’ technology so you can experience the EV9 GT shifting through simulated automatic gearchanges. GT models benefit from a chunkier and more aggressive body kit and unique wheel designs, as well as some flashes of bright green inside. Kia says the new EV9 GT will go on sale in 2025, with Kia UK confirming the top-end model will also make its way across the Atlantic.

184,"BYD’s Stella Li on the brand’s European future, wacky model names and solid state batteries",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/byd/stella-li/,Jake Groves,2024-10-16,Car Magazine UK,"BYD, or Build Your Dreams, is on a roll in Europe. The brand is expanding fast, with new models like the plug-in hybrid and a wider range of variant options for the in the UK and on the Continent coming on stream. But the brand is also facing growing pains. It, along with other car brands based in China that are launching and expanding in Europe, are now becoming in the region as the EU Commission intervenes with ‘anti-subsidy’ legislation. Stella Li, BYD’s head of European operations, is right at the centre of the brand’s growth. We spend time with Li at the , not long before she and her team pull the covers off (pictured below) – a battery-electric crossover that’ll go on sale in Europe to take on the . Li has gone on record that these additional tariffs on Chinese car makers are ‘unfair,’ that politicians should ‘stay away’ from them as it is only ‘adding more cost to auto manufacturing and confusing the industry.’ So, how will BYD weather the storms in Europe, as it and so many other Chinese car makers gain more of a foothold in the region despite these additional measures? ‘We’re the global number one for new energy cars. Our global market share for NEV is 23 per cent, which is an amazing number,’ Li tells us. For reference, ‘new energy’ vehicles include conventional hybrids, plug-in hybrid models and battery-electric cars, as well as hydrogen fuel cell models. ‘In the end, the industry will wash out the true competitors,’ Li adds. ‘You need a company that not only has the technology but the financial stability, manufacturing capacity and a real business plan for the future.’ As well as BYD’s enormous manufacturing capacity in its home country, the brand has plans to manufacture models in Europe, having already announced . A deal has also been made with the Turkish government for an additional manufacturing facility in the country. Despite uphill political battles, Li says it is ‘so satisfying’ to see BYD models on the roads in Europe, adding that consumers in the region ‘are the best.’ But Li also acknowledges that BYD is still in the brand-building phase with European consumers; ‘they’re a little conservative, true, and they need time to understand you but that’s just a timing measure. Once they build that trust with us, we should be okay.’ A key differentiator for BYD is the brand’s rather unconventional names for its cars; , Dolphin, Sea Lion and the like aren’t the usual sort of names given to cars – at least to typical European tastes. Surely that’s a shrewd marketing strategy? ‘Yeah, maybe when people talk about BYD, the name might not be sexy but at least they’re talking about us!’ smiles Li. ‘I’m joking, of course, but the more you enjoy the car itself, you almost ignore the name. ‘And with models like the Seal and new Sea Lion, we’re looking to people who are interested in nature – we’re saying that these cars are designed to be a part of nature and not damaging it. So that is where these names are good – it may be strange to the rest of the car industry, but it’s unique for us.’ While the lower end of the car market now looks a little shakier with new tariffs in place, BYD’s extreme, luxury Yangwang sub-brand has garnered interest. Its U9 supercar features advanced suspension that can keep the car level even if it’s driving on three wheels, while the monstrous U8 SUV can tank turn. Li also points to technical demonstrations of the U8 not just wading but swimming through deep pools of water without any negative effects. ‘It’s been a shock [for Europe], I think, but it’s the same reaction we’ve had from Chinese consumers,’ Li says of the Yangwang brand. ‘It’s given us a strong confidence, and people are believing what we say when we talk about a technology-defined future.’ Which is a particular BYD strong point. The company started life as a battery manufacturer, moving onto building consumer electronics before expanding into the automotive segment. The industry’s logical next step in battery tech, though is solid state; Toyota claims it will sell a car with a SSB in 2026, with Nissan claiming the same for 2028 for example. Where does BYD stand? ‘Every single technology [in a car]… BYD has a place to engineer it and to study it,’ says Li. ‘But going from the lab to being commercially available is a long way – you need a lot of verifications and test drives and even abuse to make sure it’s safe. And safety is the number one priority for BYD. ‘Secondly, you need to think about manufacturing capacity and cost competitiveness of the technology. At the moment with solid state, it’s still to far to be commercialised.’ Instead, the brand is more focused on its next generation LFP (lithium-ion phosphate) battery. Its ‘Blade’ battery tech is regularly touted by the brand as one of the safest on the market, and BYD is reportedly developing a new generation that is capable of 620 miles on a single charge under Chinese homologation tests.

201,Convertible Cooper completes all-new Mini line up and is set for production at Cowley,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mini/convertible/,Paula Cullington,2024-10-08,Car Magazine UK,"The new Mini Cooper Convertible has officially joined the ranks of the refreshed Mini family, bringing alfresco thrills to the new generation. Set to roll off the production line at Mini Plant Oxford later this year for the first time after a nine-year break, the new model is offered in three trim levels. Prices will start at £26,200, with first deliveries scheduled for early 2025 – just in time for next summer. Drivers can choose between two petrol engines. The standard Mini Cooper Convertible C produces 165bhp and can reach 62 mph in 8.2 seconds, while the performance-oriented Cooper Convertible S ups the ante with 212bhp, achieving the same sprint in a brisk 6.9 seconds. The Convertible comes in three trim offerings, just like the Cooper hatch: Classic, Exclusive, and Sport. For the Mini Convertible Cooper C, the entry-level classic trim features a black-trimmed front grille and 16-inch alloys. The Cooper S Classic upgrades the wheels to 17-inch dark grey alloys. The standard body colour is silver with a black/blue interior trim for both the Cooper C and S. Exclusive trim offers a more premium look, with a silver front grille and Mini logos, 17-inch alloy wheels, and an eye-catching British Racing Green exterior body colour. Inside, it features blue seats and a light beige/grey dash dashboard knit. Sport trim adds a performance-inspired edge, with a unique front and rear design. It features a gloss hexagonal grille surround, sculpted front and rear aprons, and black brake callipers with JCW badging, which is a nod to the John Cooper Works racing outfit. The exterior is completed by 18-inch JCW alloy wheels, with red paint. Meanwhile, the interior of the Sport trim steps things up throughout the cabin, too. It comes with JCW black cord/Vescin (Minis vegan alternative to leather) seats, a dashboard with black/red accents, and a partially perforated steering wheel featuring red highlights. Paddle shifters on the wheel and decorative black/red knit trim complete the sporty, more driver-focused set-up. The roof is fully automatic at a flick of a switch, going from closed to open in just 18 seconds. Impatient types can operate the roof on the move (up to 19mph) and for partial convertible motoring the roof can be opened a small amount (40cm) for a sunroof effect (see below). In case it all goes horribly wrong, there is rollover protection as part of the safety kit. Just like the hatchback you get the 9.5-inch circular OLED display, which is both touch and voice-operated to access the usual functions such as navigation, phone, and entertainment. Mini Convertible Cooper owners can use the Mini app to set their smartphones up as the key to the car; when the owner gets close to the vehicle the car will flash its light in a set sequence and unlock the doors.

202,Nissan announces vehicle-to-grid tech for 2026 cars and beyond,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/nissan/vehicle-to-grid/,Jake Groves,2024-10-10,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan has confirmed it will launch new cars with vehicle-to-grid technology, with the first arriving in 2026. The brand says it will offer ‘affordable’ vehicle-to-grid technology and is the first in the UK to achieve power grid certification. ‘The days are over that we just look at a car as a vehicle to bring us from A to B,’ says Nissan senior vice president for sustainability and corporate affairs, Friederike Kienitz. Nissan has been engineering its own V2G technology for the last few years with help from Enovates (a charger developer), Dreev (a subsidiary of EDF Energy) and a trial location at the University of Nottingham. The V2G technology will launch on an updated version of the Ariya, as well as future EVs. ‘On a vehicle today, you have a charger that you plug into your AC current, and then the car manages the conversion of that AC into DC and puts it in the battery, which is then later used to power the wheels,’ says senior vice president for research and development, David Moss. ‘We simply want to reverse that process in a cost-effective way.’ Vehicle-to-grid technology – also known as bi-directional charging – allows an electric car to be charged conventionally at home. But the charger setup also allows power to be fed from the car’s battery back into the national power grid during times of peak demand. The idea is that, during peak times, the grid can request a set amount of charge from your electric car to relieve strain and then return the same amount of charge at another period – likely when electricity demand is low and therefore cheaper. You need a car with the technology on board to discharge itself via its plug socket as well as a wallbox that can manage the flow of power. Why is Nissan bothering? Well, first of all, this V2G project is to see it into the 2030s. As well as helping to decarbonise the brand globally, the Ark plan includes an enormous expansion and overhaul of its global product ranges. ‘We are bringing four EVs to the market [over the next few years],’ adds Kienitz. ‘Three models [for Europe] – Juke, Leaf and Qashqai – are going to be EVs, and produced at the Sunderland plant.’ The fourth is – twinned with . Like Renault, Nissan plans to offer a (rather stylish) wallbox home charger and a tariff designed to maximise the benefits of bi-directional charging when it launches. Nissan says that, for an average semi-detached homeowner with a rough working time out of the house between 07:45 and 17:45, V2G charging could halve the cost of electricity bills. All very nominal and representative, but Nissan is convinced it’s a serious benefit. And so does the likes of EDF Energy. While showing us official National Grid projections of future energy usage, the widespread adoption of V2G technology would be a huge positive impact on the grid’s ability to cope. ‘In the UK, there aren’t enough grid connections to electrify everything we need to electrify at the moment,’ says Rebecca Rosling, head of future energy systems at EDF Energy UK. ‘To fix that will be long and expensive, albeit achievable. But doing anything like [widespread V2G adoption] that helps us to use the grid to the best of its ability makes a huge difference.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

204,Merc boss: we're fully committed to electric AND fully committed to petrol,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mercedes-benz/ola-kallenius/,Colin Overland,2024-10-11,Car Magazine UK,"Maybe this time we’ll listen. Mercedes boss Ola Källenius insists that when in 2020 he championed the move to , there was a clause about ‘where market conditions allow’. But everyone just heard the bit about moving to full electric, and that’s not really happening very quickly. He still says: ‘We’re moving towards a zero-emission future. So the destination has not changed. It’s zero-emission for the industry; it’s certainly zero-emission for Mercedes-Benz.’ But this time around there’s a fresh emphasis on continuing to offer a choice of combustion engines – not just leftover stock, but updated and improved combustion engines, all with some degree of electrification. ‘One decision we already made, back in 2020, that the combustion portfolio, all electrified, we’d have a complete overhaul of those ready by 2026.’ That’s in time to meet the in Europe, China and the US. ‘The combustion portfolio, from our brand new high-tech hybridised four-cylinder that we’re developing for the MMA platform, all the way up to the V8 that AMG customers and others love to death, that whole portfolio is available to us.’ Initial expectations that by now something like 20 or 25 per cent of new car sales in Europe would be electric have not been met – the reality is, on average, closer to 10 per cent. ‘If you are an established manufacturer, what is your reaction to that? Slam on the brakes, wait to see if the market will come again? Or do you press on? We have decided for the latter – press on,’ said Källenius, speaking to journalists at the Mercedes proving ground at Immendingen, Germany. ‘When I made the statement in 2020 – Mercedes-Benz will be in the position to serve markets with the complete electric portfolio, where market conditions allow – some people in your trade decided to not focus too much on the half-sentence after the comma. But I said it for a reason, because none of us have a crystal ball. I’m the first to admit I thought the whole market would be further at this stage, that we would be further. ‘So we are pressing on. We are now preparing for the biggest product offensive, number of launches of new vehicles, in the history of our company, kicking it off with the first one on the MMA architecture, . ‘I was driving it around the test track today, a fantastic car by the way. I’m ever so slightly biased, but it’s unbelievable. It’s a new car ushering in a new era, and ’25-’26-’27-’28’s just going to be one vehicle after the other. The intensity of launches in that period is unprecedented for our company.’ The plan is to continue to offer cars in three broad categories: the top end (S-Class, AMGs, Maybachs, G-Class), the core (E-Class, C-Class etc) and a slimmed-down entry-level family based on the new CLA and GLA. Expect future models to have different underpinnings for petrol and electric, but they’re likely to have the same name – so the next EQS would become an electric S-Class, but would be different under the skin. The pattern has already been established by the , where the electric and combustion versions all have G prefixes – so instead of EQ for the electric one it’s – and all look near identical. Källenius also confirmed that an all-electric AMG is on its way – possibly previewed next year, definitely revealed in the metal in 2026. ‘We are working on a from-the-ground-up, white-sheet-of-paper, fully dedicated, electric performance platform. It will have mind-boggling performance. I have driven some of the early prototypes and I’m electrified.’ Wider take-up of EVs would need a holistic approach, he said; however good the cars are, people won’t buy them if they’re too expensive or too difficult to live with. ‘It’s about systemic change: charging infrastructure, the cost of electricity, taxation and incentivisation. To just rest on product alone would be too narrow in your thinking.’ He cautioned against heavy-handed measures by European and US politicians wanting to . ‘I think it is not the right strategy to turn to protectionism,’ he said. ‘It’s fundamentally against your own business model. That does not mean that I don’t think we should do what is necessary to create a level playing field. Let’s have a discussion about a level playing field. But to resort to the very crude method of just putting up a wall, a tariff, that maybe then kicks off a reaction on the other side, you then in the worst case have an escalating trade conflict. That would be to lose-lose. Certainly for a player dependent on exports, it’s not the right strategy. Try to find a negotiated solution. Don’t shut off markets. It’s going to stifle growth and make us weaker.’ In a time of transformation, it was natural that start-ups should see an opportunity. ‘In China at the moment you have more than 100 makers in the EV segment. Will there be some level of consolidation over the next five to 10 years? I absolutely believe so. We’re seeing a natural development of the market, a competitively intense period. Now is the time to really double down on your brand promise, not sit back. Invest higher than you probably have ever done, but also double down on efficiency to make sure you can afford that investment, make sure you produce positive cashflows in this tough environment, so you can be your own venture capitalist. Make sure you have a sound balance sheet so you have a little bit of a war chest. We’re doing our best to navigate through that.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
205,Driverless Robotaxi and Robovan are Tesla’s autonomous vision,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/robotaxi/,Jake Groves,2024-10-11,Car Magazine UK,"Tesla has revealed its long-teased Robotaxi and Robovan at a special event. The new vehicles are Tesla’s next steps in terms of autonomy and self-driving technology. ‘You see a lot of sci-fi movies where the future is dark and dismal, it’s not a future you want to be in,’ says Elon Musk during the streamed We, Robot event at a Warner Bros. studio. ‘We want a fun, exciting future. The new Robotaxi is a two-door, butterfly-doored coupe with enormous wheels and a clean design. Inside there is no steering wheel – just seats and a typically enormous screen. That’s how far Tesla is pushing its ‘full self-driving’ technology – it’s developing a vehicle without any conventional driver controls. The first step is ensuring its Model 3 and Model Y are approved for ‘unsupervised’ self-driving in 2025, before the Robotaxi arrives in 2027. And, like Tesla’s other models, the Robotaxi and Robovan do without lidar, instead relying on AI and cameras to drive autonomously. ‘When we think of transport today, there’s a lot of pain that we take on that we think is normal,’ he adds, ‘like having to drive around LA in three hours of traffic. But there’s also the fact that cars cost too much and not used that much – on average around 10 hours out of 168 hours per week. But if they were autonomous, they could be used five times more, maybe even 10 times more.’ The Robotaxi is also destined to have wireless charging; ‘Robotaxi has no plug, it just drives over an inductive charger.’ On top of that, the Robovan is designed to be more of a bus and goods transport vehicle. ‘We’re going to make this, and it’ll look like that,’ says Musk. Musk says that the ‘cost of autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like individualised mass transit,’ adding that he wants to ‘change the look of roads’ and reduce the amount of parking lots in the UK.

It’s France’s main car show, and alternates with IAA Mobility – the automotive and tech show based in Munich. You can safely expect a strong showing from the domestic brands, but other manufacturers will muscle into the 2024 Paris motor show, too. We’ll keep this page up to date with all of the latest new car debuts from the show floor in the coming days. Alfa’s confirmed a hybrid version of its Junior will arrive at the Paris show to go alongside the Elettrica model This is what will preview 2025’s electric crossover from Alpine. It’s a swooping, low-roof SUV promising sports car thrills with a tri-motor EV set-up and nifty torque vectoring for razor-sharp handling. Yes, they really are claiming it’s as fast and dynamic as an A110 sports car – just repackaged for family duties. The Paris show is simply another opportunity to get some more show time for Alpine’s upcoming hot hatch in production form. BYD has confirmed attendance, saying it will be promoting its range of cars at the show and launching something new for the European market. Citroen’s main show star will be a new concept, likely previewing the next-generation C5 Aircross. The brand says the new concept is ‘highly expressive’ and remains ‘faithful to Citroen’s new styling language,’ adding that it ‘is no doubt that this illustration of a future model in a major segment will appeal to visitors.’ We’ve already , as well as . Citroen says this is another opportunity to get its low-cost and super-simple new city car in front of as many people as possible. Citroen is also priming an update to its wacky hatchback/crossover combo, injecting a bit of fresh design and likely some new technology into the mix. The brand says the updated models will ‘adopt a simpler, more coherent design that reflects the Brand’s new identity.’ Dacia’s larger SUV has been officially revealed ahead of its public debut at the show. The brand previewed a larger family SUV with the Bigster concept back in 2021, with this production spec one going on sale in the first few months of 2025. You can’t have a Mini model without a spicy JCW version. But this time, both the combustion model and electric version of Mini’s hatch will benefit from JCW models. Leaked images online also show an Aceman JCW. A pair of urban-focused tiny tots will star at Renault’s new mobility sub brand – the Duo and Bento are the spiritual successors to the Twizy and there’ll be a passenger and commercial version. Simply a new powertrain for Peugeot’s striking crossover. The brand says the e-408 ‘completes the EV line-up’, offering around 280 miles of range from its 58.2kWh battery pack. Renault is continuing to pump that retro well with its new 4, with the first teasers of the fresh new model having already been released. The taller, boxier small EV is designed to be a crossover compatriot to the . We’re expecting the R4 to be the biggest new car reveal of the entire show. Renault’s vision of the future goes beyond pumping the retro design well. This is a lightweight, grand and electric/hydrogen hybrid vision of where the brand wants to go in the years to come. It’s our first chance to see the new Mk4 Twingo in the metal, after it was teased at last year’s investors’ day. A proper return to the 1992 original, the monobox EV is cute, clever and coming in 2026… hopefully (right-hand drive sales are not yet confirmed). The Paris motor show, officially named the Mondial de L’Auto, is a biennial automotive and tech expo. The show alternates each year with the show , last held in 2023. 1 Place de la Porte de Versailles, 75015 Paris, France 15-20 October 2024 From 09:30am on weekdays; 09:00am on the weekend From €16 on pre-sale (all are now sold out); from €18 for adults each day Kids entry for €10 (ages 7-15), free for under-7s Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

207,Take 02: Lynk & Co launches its first EV in Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lynk-and-co/02-ev/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-10-11,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the 02, a new from Geely-owned Lynk & Co. Just launched at an event in Milan, it’s the second product from the brand to be offered both in the Chinese and EU markets (joining the hybrid 01) and the first EV to make it to the continent. ‘The all-new 02 represents the next phase for Lynk & Co,’ said Nicolas López Appelgren, CEO of Lynk & Co. ‘We are expanding our business model, growing our product portfolio, and venturing into new markets. These strategic steps underscore Lynk & Co’s commitment to providing greater choice, flexibility, and access for our customers.’ It seems that ‘other markets’ doesn’t currently include the UK, but our presence at the launch means it could well be on the horizon. Called the Z20 in China, the 02 is a five-door C-segment SUV with a swept back roof and wheelbase of 2750mm. In total it’s 4460mm long, 1840mm wide and 1570mm tall, putting it right in the middle of the C-segment. Think and you’re pretty much there. Like the 01 hybrid before it, the 02 has been crafted by designers at Lynk & Co’s Gothenburg, Sweden HQ. The brand hasn’t been around for long, but it’s fair to say Lynk & Co already has a very distinctive style. On the 02 that translates into a split headlight configuration with ‘spindly’ fork-shaped DRLs. At the rear you get a spoiler outlined by the rear lights – almost like glowing scaffolding. And one more thing: it’s much bigger than it looks in the pictures and has a touch of the previous-gen Civic about it… It’s not just all for style though; there are functional bits too, such as a grille with an active shutter designed to increase efficiency when not in use. As you’d expect, the 02 is built on Geely’s Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) platform. It uses 66kWh battery and electric motor on the rear axle to produce 253lb ft of torque and 268bhp. That’s good for 0-62mph in 5.5 seconds and a top speed of 112mph. Range is a punchy 445km or 277 miles in the top (of two) model and the 02 will charge from 10% to 80% in half an hour using a 150kW DC charger. Range is just 10km less in the Core model. Inside, the Lynk & Co strikes an interesting blend of premium and sustainable. As you’d expect, a huge 15.4-inch HD display sits in the middle of the cabin, and it’s the place where you’ll change navigation, media and vehicle settings. So far, so Geely. There’s a 10.2-inch HD display for the driver and other bits of tech like an optional 1.6kW, 14-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, and dual wireless phone chargers. Both are powered by third-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon chip for the snappiest user experience. Something Lynk & Co designers are calling an ‘infinity light’ plays a big role in the cabin. Designed to communicate warnings and generally set and communicate the mood, it’ll be a key feature of the brand’s cars going forward. Like the the 02 also packs in more than one type of horn. Called a ‘hey honk’ it’ll literally say ‘excuse me’ to pedestrians rather than the standard horn. It can be toggled and changed thankfully. We’ve not sat in it yet, but the 02 packs in 410-litres of boot space, and 15 extra litres in the frunk. If that’s not enough space, Lynk & Co has also thrown in a modular storage systems. It’s not coming to the UK, but in Europe the entry-level Core model will start from €35,495 – around £30,000. That rises to €39,495 (around £33,000) for the 02 More variant, which adds the aforementioned Harman Kardon speaker system, 20-inch wheels and a 360-degree camera among other tech. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
208,Audi’s Q6 e-Tron gains Sportback bodystyle at Paris 2024 show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q6-e-tron/,Jake Groves,2024-10-13,Car Magazine UK,"Audi’s newest EV, the Q6 e-Tron, is now available as a Sportback coupe alongside its standard SUV model. Audi has just unveiled it at . The bodystyle follows the same trend as, well, pretty much every Audi for the last 15 years or so by being entirely the same car as before but with a different roofline. But a benefit of this being an EV, says Audi, is a slight increase in claimed range. So the Q6 e-Tron range now includes all-wheel drive versions of the SUV and Sportback, as well as SQ6 SUV and Sportback models. While was Audi’s first proper stab at going electric (when it was just called the e-Tron SUV in 2018 and ) and the is hoovering up business at the lower end of the spectrum, the Q6 is taking aim at that widening mid-size SUV market. Audi openly says it’s targeting cars like the , (and its forthcoming Neue Klasse replacement), the Jaguar I-Pace and Nio’s EL6. It certainly looks familiar, doesn’t it? It’s twinned with , but there are plenty of Audi’s familiar design details like a large grille-but-not-really-a-grille arrangement at the front and blistered wheelarches front and rear. Audi’s also making a big fuss about the use of light with the Q6, revealing the new model features some firsts for the industry. The new double-deck lighting ‘face’ is also on many more Audi models including the A6 e-Tron saloon and Avant estate, as well as the next-generation Q7 SUV due in a couple of years. There is also a traditionally Audi (read: sober) colour palette with plenty of greys and blacks available, as well as ‘plasma blue’ seen pictured. Wheel sizes depend on spec, with Audi saying the choices will range from 18-21 inches. And, dimensionally, the Q6 e-Tron is not actually that much smaller than a Q8 e-Tron. The Q6 is 4.77m long compared to the Q8’s 4.9m length, but the supposedly smaller Q6 manages to be as wide and the SUV version is a couple of cm taller. As for luggage space, the Q6 e-Tron has a 526-litre load area at the rear, as well as an impressively deep 64-litre space under the bonnet. Audi’s always been right at the forefront of light tech, but it takes another leap. The Q6 launches with Audi’s ‘second-generation’ OLED technology, massively increasing the pixel count and abilities of its lighting tech. The front DRLs now feature 61 individual segments (up from 10 in the Q4 e-Tron) and the rear light bar includes 60 pixels per OLED segment (up from its previous high of six before). Naturally, that allows for a whole range of additional customisation options front and rear, with several light signatures available for both the front and rear DRLs – even including an active, perpetually-animated design on the rear for the first time. But, before you go grumbling about this just being for show, Audi’s keen to counter that. For example, the Q6 e-Tron will show up a red warning triangle in its rear lights if you brake suddenly or put the hazard warning lights on. Or, if you’re using the car’s automated parking assistant, arrows appear when you’re in reverse to communicate to other road users of your intentions. Dr. Michael Kruppa, head of headlight development at Audi, says there’s scope for even more animations in the future, saying that ‘you have to take small steps forward first so we get used to the technology.’ A considerable step-change here, too, to the point that it feels like quite a rewrite. It’s quite decontented, with (sadly) a lot of physical buttons removed for a cleaner design and a *lot* of glossy black panelling. But there are a select few, with a row on the centre console as well as a massive panel on the drivers’ door for controlling lights, locks, seat memory and mirror adjustments all in one place. The Q6 also features a steering wheel very like the one on the Q4, complete with touch panel buttons. The thing that dominates the interior is Aud’s new ‘Digital Stage’ – the name of its large, curved panel that houses the 11.9-inch digital instruments and a 14.5-inch central infotainment display. The shape itself is even meant to echo the brand’s trapezoidal ‘Singleframe’ grille, and there’s the option of a 10.9-inch widescreen infotainment display, too. A new era for Audi means a new software and infotainment design, heavily evolving its graphics and modernising many parts – even the warning bongs sound different. The Q6’s central display is Android-based, and shares a lot in common with the ‘MIB4’ infotainment seen in the latest range of VWs (like the ID.7, Passat, Tiguan and Golf 8.5) – albeit with a heavy Audi spin on it. The home screen has a traditional tile-based layout, presenting the most used applications to the driver – and it can be customised. Like VW’s new system, the climate controls have a fixed location along the bottom edge, and you can tweak certain features of that toolbar to fit what you use most. A new-generation AI-augmented voice assistant is included, which Audi says can control around 800 in-car functions with each of them having around 100 possible commands. As well as the usual stuff a voice assistant can do (calling people, setting nav guidance, activating certain climate functions etc.), you can even ask it queries like exchange rates or get it to help you get to know your new car. On top of that, Audi is keen to point out the Q6’s ability to install apps, games and media streaming services on the infotainment to act as entertainment when charging, including a karaoke app. The Q6 e-Tron range includes Sport, Sport Performance and Sport Quattro powertrain options. The standard Sport model features an 83kWh, with the Performance and Quattro models using a 100kWh pack. Power rises from 248bhp, to 302bhp and then 382bhp for each respective version, with 0-62mph performance dropping from 7.6sec to 6.7sec and 5.9sec. The model with the biggest range is the Sport Performance version, which Audi claims up to 393 miles for the SUV or 395 miles for the Sportback. Then there’s the more potent SQ6 e-Tron, which benefits from 482bhp (which rises to 509bhp when launch control is used) and 586lb ft, completing the 0-62mph sprint in 4.3sec and topping out at 143mph. Audi says the range for the SQ8 can hit up to 371 miles for the SUV or 377 miles for the Sportback, with the deficit mainly being due to the sporty model’s wider tyres. Well, Audi is very proud of its electric motors, claiming them to be among the most efficient in the industry. The brand uses asynchronous motors on the front axle and permanent synchronous motors on the rear, with its units featuring dry sump oil cooling for better efficiency and heat management. The benefits of the wider PPE platform are apparent, too. When compared to the battery pack in the original e-Tron SUV from 2018, Audi says the 100kWh battery pack is 30 per cent denser, but weighs around 15 per cent less and takes 30 per cent less time to charge. The inclusion of a standard heat pump, according to engineers, adds around 19 miles of extra range compared to if the car came without one. Like the Q8 e-Tron and the e-Tron GT, the Q6 e-Tron (as well as other cars that’ll use the PPE platform) benefits from two AC charge ports – one on each side – with one accepting punchier DC charging rates. Something that Bernhard Rieger, battery cell integration expert, says is there ‘purely for convenience.’ Speaking of charging rates, regardless of what Q6 model you get, it can be charged at up to 270kW if you get access to a powerful charger. Like the new Macan, the Q6 benefits from bank charging; if the public charger can’t handle the PPE platform’s 800-volt power, the car will split the battery into two and run each half at 400 volts, ensuring quick charging even on older charging infrastructure. The new Audi Q6 and SQ6 e-Tron SUV are now on sale in the UK, with the Sportback models to come. Prices start from £59,145 for the standard Q6 e-Tron SUV, with a choice of Sport, S line and Edition 1 trim levels available. The SQ6 e-Tron, with its far greater performance, is considerably more expensive at £93,675. Want a Sportback? That’ll land in the first months of 2025, likely for a couple of grand more than the SUV. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

209,New Alpine A390_β concept unveiled at Paris 2024 show – an A110 sports car on stilts,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a390_concept/,Tim Pollard,2024-10-14,Car Magazine UK,"Think crossovers and SUVs all look the same? Boxy, big and a little ? Well, the deep thinkers in Dieppe are here to shake things up with the new Alpine A390_β – a thinly veiled conceptual look ahead to next year’s production crossover that deigns to take the best bits of the A110 sports car and transfer it to more everyday family life. It sounds a tall order, but here’s the proof: the concept car that’s been unveiled at the 2024 . The Alpine A390_β is an all-electric fastback that aims to rewrite the definition of sporting, coupe-influenced crossovers that’ve become modestly popular since the created the genre back in 2007. It’s roughly the length of an , at 4.7 metres long, but it’s worth observing the lower ride height; at just 1.5m tall the Alpine crossover is treading a much sportier dynamic. What you see here is firmly rooted in concept car cloud-cuckoo land: you should ignore the handclap doors, absence of a B-pillar and much of the wackier details including illuminated wheel hubs – but the raw design principles of the A390_β are destined to survive into production. Alpine has confirmed it will go on sale by the end of 2025, priced to compete with the BMW iX2 and sportier Tesla Model 3 derivatives – let’s say around the £50k mark. That kind of premium positioning is in line with Alpine’s market strategy: it’s not chasing volume, but rather high-margin, profitable sales. That, in a nutshell is the plan. Purists may wish to take a deep breath, but the designers of the A110 have deemed to replicate the sporting dynamism of the smash-hit A110 in a taller package. So there is a new interpretation of the brand’s distinctive face, a neatly wrought wraparound rear window that really does echo the sports car’s and, of course, Alpine’s familiar rich blue paintwork to chime with the rest of the fledgling range. ‘It’s all about duality,’ said design chief Antony Villain. ‘It’s a racing car in a tuxedo.’ Strip away the hyperbole, and you can see that the A390_β ramps up the sporting vibe to position the upcoming production car in the right space. Hence why the concept car’s interior has two modes: it’ll flip from more relaxed driving mode with comfort chairs to a driver’s seat more akin to an F1 driver’s position – with dynamic seats that flip from road car to race buckets on command. In a similar fashion, the rear of the car extends to create a longtail rump for improved aero. Parent group Renault has form with shape-shifting bodywork (remember the concept car of 2020?) but this is merely a designer’s flight of fancy. The production car will be a more conventional shape with fixed bodywork and regular mirrors in place of the concept’s cameras. What realistic is the fastback silhouette. The sloping roofline is very much confirmed for the 2025 Alpine A390 production car and Villain promises showroom versions will offer five seats and a ‘usable’ loadbay competitive with rivals’. Alpine’s vice president of product, Sovany Ang, described the concept car as ‘85% true to the final production car.’ We suspect you can remove some of the minerals in the interior and the Alpine snow-effect rear seat will surely be deemed too difficult to productionise at the historic Dieppe HQ where the A390 will be built… While you can tone down the design of the beta concept car, the engineering is very much on-point. The A390 will be equipped with three electric motors, to ensure very Alpine performance and handling. Each rear wheel has its own motor, with a third unit up front for all-wheel drive as standard. Tellingly, Alpine is not planning a single-motor version – in line with its premium market aspirations. The company has been developing sophisticated torque vectoring for the past five years and it showed CAR videos of the A390 prototype testing alongside a regular Alpine A110, engineers claiming the two produced identical laptimes. It’s hard to stomach the promises of ‘lightweight engineering’ when no kerbweight has been confirmed for the A390 and there’s a large lithium-ion cell stacked along its spine, but Alpine is using some lightweight materials – including carbonfibre – in the concept car to keep mass in check. No word yet on the battery size and specs (‘it is quite a big battery,’ confirmed Villain), so it’s too early to call EV range or performance figures. The Alpine A390 production car is based on the Amp-R Medium platform that will underpin most of the medium and larger electric vehicles in the group. The concept car rides on large-diameter 22-inch wheels shod in Michelin Pilot Sport tyres. Alpine’s expansion plan is becoming clearer with each passing month. The A390 is the company’s first move into the family sector – a much higher-volume segment than today’s sports coupe niche. It currently produces just 4500 cars a year globally , remember. That number is set to swell significantly with the arrival of the Alpine A290 electric hot hatch (a reworked EV) and now the A390 fastback crossover. ‘Our products are conquest cars – they will appeal to a new type of customer,’ said Villain. His boss Alpine Cars CEO Philippe Krieff told CAR that sports cars would always remain at the heart of the brand, but that it was necessary to expand into further niches to ensure the company’s long-term success. One new model will launch each year until the end of the decade: If you’re struggling to get your head around the badging and nomenclature, understand this: the ’10’ part of the name signifies sports cars, while ’90’ means practical, everyday vehicles.

210,Renault’s urban twins - the Mobilize Duo and Bento – revealed at Paris 2024 show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_mobilize/duo/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-10-14,Car Magazine UK,"The Mobilize Duo and Bento are the first vehicles to launch as part of Renault’s new urban mobility brand, and both are set to arrive in the UK in spring 2025. The Duo, as the name hints, is a two-seater that is set to rival the and follows in the footsteps of the , although it shares little with its quirky predecessor. It measures just 2.43 metres long and 1.30 metres wide which, to put that into perspective, is more than half a metre shorter and 10cm narrower than an original Mini. It’s so small, Renault says you can park three Duos side-by-side in a standard parking space, making it ideally suited to life in the city. The production version is on the stand at the 2024 and is remarkably close to the concept model that first appeared at the equivalent event in 2022. This time around we have more information on the powertrain and battery that will be underneath the two. The motor is the 48V one that is otherwise fitted to the mild hybrid Renault Austral, which gives an indication of the relative size differences between the two vehicles. The battery is a 10.3kWh unit that is one of the modules from the Renault 5 E-Tech. Combined, these provide a range of up to 100 miles (161km) for the Duo and 93 miles (149km) for the Bento. Renault reckons that it will be able to manage at least 60 miles, if not more, in the winter and even if the driver is rather unsympathetic with their right foot. It’s not as slow as the Ami either, with a top speed of 50mph. There is a version that will be limited to 28mph, but we are unlikely to get that in the UK. Charging is also quite rapid and designed to slot into the sort of spots where bigger EVs wouldn’t normally head – you aren’t going to be rocking up at the motorway rapid chargers for example. Instead, the pair come fitted with a cable that is fixed to the front end. This has either a standard domestic plug or a Type 2 connection to allow it to easily slot into a wallbox. It will get from 20% to 80% (which equates to around 120km) in around 3hr 25min on a Type 2 socket, while a domestic socket takes 3hr 50min. Mobilize says that 25km of that will come in the first hour. Mobilize is still ironing out some of the details of exactly what the UK will get, and whether this tethered cable will allow you to plug in using a wallbox that has its own tethered cable. What it does say is that it will aim to ensure as many people as possible can use the vehicles. The Duo and Bento are more sophisticated than their Renault Twizy ancestor, with more luxuries and safety features in the cabin. Sure, they are not going to be able to offer all the active and passive safety systems as a standard car, but they are the only quadricycle to come with an airbag while the seatbelts come with a force limiter too. Comfort is a higher priority too, with air-conditioning, a heated windscreen and even a heated driver’s seat. There should be none of the bone-shaking ride that the Twizy provided either, with a wider track looking to help position the wheels and shock absorbers in the best possible place to deal with urban bumps. There are a few other bits around the cabin, too, including a USB-C connection, Bluetooth and a phone holder, so you can use your personal device as a satnav and entertainment station. You can add rear parking sensors as well. The finished vehicle is remarkably similar to the concept, and Renault says it drew inspiration from videogaming, as well as 1980s and 1990s fashion. For example, the dashboard was styled to look like a boombox – and you’ll be able to pick from a selection of other colours. The Duo’s seating layout is like the Citroen Ami’s, with the passenger sitting slightly behind the driver to maximise the amount of elbow room, while the Bento has a single central seat. The seats are trimmed with wipe-down polyamide-coated fabric pads, and there’s space either side of the driver’s seat to store two cabin bags. Its doors open upwards rather than outwards which Renault says will make it easier to get out of the car in tight parking spaces. Unusually, the Mobilize Duo also doesn’t have a key. Instead, the door locks and ignition are controlled using a smartphone app, which should mean it’s less hassle to share the car across company fleets. Renault also designed the Mobilize Duo to be as sustainable as possible. The body panels aren’t painted and the front and rear bumpers are identical to save money on production costs. Recycled materials make up 40 percent of the body and, when it reaches the end of its life, it’ll be 95 percent recyclable. Citroen turned its tiny Ami quadricycle into a van by removing the standard model’s passenger seat and bolting a storage box into the newly freed space in the cabin. Renault is planning to pull a similar trick with the Duo, but its offering promises to be much more practical. The Mobilize Bento is based on the same platform as the Duo, but it features a different body with a massive 649-litre cargo box on the back. That’s around three times the capacity of a Volkswagen Up!’s boot and, most importantly, 440-litres more than you get in the Citroen Ami Cargo. There’s a further 351 litres dotted around the cabin in various storage boxes, taking the total carrying capacity to a cubic metre. The rear can open as wide as 140 degrees and there’s a handy hatch between the cargo bay and the cockpit to allow drivers to transport longer items. Renault also plans to launch a range of accessories for the cargo area, like tool racks, to suit the needs of different professionals. Anything you carry needs to be fairly light, though, as it is only allowed to take a maximum payload of 80kg. It’s simply a case of waiting until early 2025, with first deliveries expected in the spring. UK pricing hasn’t been confirmed yet but it will likely be similar to those announced in France. The UK-bound version starts at €10,700 or just under £9000. The Bento van starts at €10,000, or just under £8400, but that isn’t including VAT. What is more likely is that you’ll be able to finance it, as Mobilize is set to offer some flexible solutions on that front. France is offering a package that allows you to put down just under €3000 and then pay €29 a month – expect something similar over here.

211,Light and space: new Volkswagen Tayron SUV revealed at Paris 2024 show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/tayron/,Seth Walton,2024-10-14,Car Magazine UK,"VW fans Rejoice! A fresh-faced, range-splitting for European markets has just been revealed – say hello to the all-new Volkwagen Tayron. It’s just made its public debut at the . If you’re wondering where the Tayron sits in the line-up, it’s positioned just below the but above the , replacing the Tiguan Allspace. So it’s a fairly chunky SUV, but we also know that the Tayron is to be blessed with a diverse range of power-units for customers to choose from. It’s going to launch with just a mild hybrid offered, but VW says two turbocharged petrols, two turbo diesels and two plug-in hybrid options will eventually be on the table. Every power unit offered will be coupled to VW’s battle-hardened DSG automatic gearbox. The launch eTSI will have a power output of 148bhp, while the two PHEVs will be offered in 201bhp and 268bhp configurations. The’ll also have an electric range of over 60 miles, according to the official figures, but rest assured we at CAR will get to the bottom of whether they ring true just as soon as we can. ‘The new Tayron is a bona fide Volkswagen,’ CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars Thomas Schäfer said. ‘With this new Volkswagen SUV, we are further expanding our range in a growing segment and closing the gap between our best-seller, the Tiguan, and our luxury SUV, the Touareg. I am convinced that the Tayron will make its mark and be well received by our customers.’ The Tayron will be offered in either five-seat or seven-seat configurations. With the five-seat box ticked, the boot offers up to 885 litres of luggage space when the seats up, while the Tayron’s towing capacity is rated at 2.5 tonnes. Bit of a jumbo bruiser, then – 4.8 metres long, to be exact. The Tayron is also offered with a decent amount of standard equipment, including three-zone automatic air con, a 12.6-inch infotainment screen and automatic main-beam control. In the entry level Life trim grade, you also receive driving experience control which can customise the cabin’s settings and set preferences to specific profiles. The Tayron will come with a raft of VW’s latest driver assistance systems, including adaptive cruise control, a parking assistance feature and a rear view camera as standard – among many other extras. Dynamic chassis control is offered as an option, along with a panoramic sunroof and electrically adjustable seats. Prices for the new Tayron start from around £38,000, and VW’s pre-order books are now open. Seth is a former staff writer across all our modern motoring titles, including CAR magazine and Parkers.

212,Smiley new Citroen Ami launched at Paris Motor Show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/ami/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-10-14,Car Magazine UK,"The Citroen Ami’s been on sale for four years. No, we couldn’t believe it either. So, in keeping with the conventions of the motoring industry, Citroen has launched a facelifted version of the little quadricycle at the . And isn’t it sweet! Citroen has rejigged its front and rear styling, which it says makes the car look ‘even more mature and friendly.’ Plus, the brand previewed the off-road Ami Buggy Vision concept which Thierry Koskas, Citroen’s CEO, hinted will spawn a production model in 2025. Apart from these tweaks, though, the Ami formula remains largely unchanged. That means it has the same dinky battery pack, the same 47-mile range and the same 28-mile top speed that allows you to drive it on a moped licence. But there’s no need to fix it if it isn’t broke – and the Ami has been a roaring success for such as small-scale passion project. Citroen has already sold more than 65,000 examples of the Ami since it was launched in 2020. Prices for the updated model haven’t yet been released, but you could put the pre-facelift car on your drive for just £7695. We can’t see the price inflating much higher than £8,000. Scroll down to learn more. The Ami is powered by a 5.5kWh battery pack and an 8bhp electric motor. Citroen says it can reach a top speed of 28mph and that it’ll cover 46 miles before needing to be recharged. That doesn’t sound like much, but Citroen reckons that’s double the required mileage for most urban motorists. Because the battery is so small, it can be completely recharged from a three-pin socket in around three hours. If you’re out and about, the Ami can also be connected to a wallbox charger or a public charge point using a Type 2 cable, although that won’t make the battery charge any faster. Well, it’s an Ami wot goes off road. It has lifted suspension, knobbly tyres, door bars in place of panels and a sunroof that puts you at the mercy of the elements. If you’re the sort of lunatic that likes to spend your weekends hang gliding or extreme ironing, then Citroen reckons this is the car you need to get to those off-piste locations. Citroen is even encouraging its Ami Buggy drivers to take up a new extreme sport. The firm has designed a special kite surfer that slots over the door bars. So, you’ve no excuse for not catching a wave. Dude. And because the Buggy was designed to go off-road, Citroen fitted it with some more heavily padded seat cushions to help isolate your backside from the rough terrain you’ll be tearing over. They feature the same tech as the Advanced Comfort seats in Citroen’s normal cars. Even though it has four wheels and two doors, the Ami technically isn’t a car. Like the , it’s a pure-electric quadricycle, which means it’s closer to a moped than a car in the eyes of the law. In France, for example, children as young as 14 can drive one without a full licence. It’s tiny, measuring a mere 2.41 metres long. It also has a -like 7.2-metre turning circle, meaning it should be a doddle to park. More than 50% of its upper body it glazed, too, which will make it easy to see kamikaze moped riders and rogue cyclists when zipping around crowded cities. Citroen says the Ami was designed as a safer urban transport solution than a scooter or a bicycle, and that it was priced to compete with public transport. To hit that low price-point, Citroen made the car as symmetrical as possible to save money on making lots of moulds. It’s a van. Only smaller. Citroen saw a gap in the market for a tiny urban courier van, so it re-engineered the Ami to suit the market. The company ditched the EV’s passenger seat and replaced it with a big plastic storage box with a 260-litre capacity and a maximum payload of 140kg. This tiny storage capacity means it probably won’t find much use with the likes of DHL and Amazon, but it could easily serve as a delivery vehicle for your local pizza restaurant. Citroen also added a lockable storage bin in the Ami Cargo’s cabin, which it says was designed to keep valuables like smartphones and wallets out of sight. Citroen reckons the Ami Cargo will be popular in big cities, partly thanks to its compact dimensions and low running costs, but mostly due to its eye-catching looks. The Ami turns heads and can be liveried up to become a distinctive rolling billboard. Citroen hasn’t yet unveiled the facelifted version of the Cargo, but we expect it’ll follow the commercial launch of the passenger carrying model in 2025.

213,"New Citroen C5 Aircross Concept previews… well, you can work it out",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/c5-aircross-concept/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-10-14,Car Magazine UK,"Stellantis is on a mission right now to replace all its mid-sized SUVs. This year, we’ve had new generations of the and – and now it’s the turn of Citroen. This rather striking-looking concept is our first official glimpse at the next generation . It’s called, rather unimaginatively, the Citroen C5 Aircross Concept – and it is the centrepiece of the brand’s stand. It previews a production-spec car that’s due to hit our showrooms in 2025 but, even though that’s only a few months away, Citroen is still playing its cards close to its chest. We didn’t even see the concept’s interior at the show and the company’s executives wouldn’t be drawn on the specifics of the car’s powertrains. However, the brand assured us that this new car will be more comfortable, more spacious and more practical than the outgoing model. Scroll down to learn everything we know so far. Well, this new one’s bigger for a start. The concept measures 4.65 metres long, which is 15cm longer than the outgoing C5 Aircross and should translate to a little more legroom for rear-seat passengers. It’s a little more low-slung than its predecessor, though, with a height of 1.66 metres. For reference, the previous car was 1.69 metres tall. It also wears Citroen’s latest design language, which was introduced on the . So, the C5 shares the same face, similar headlights, the same rough silhouette and kindred surfacing to its smaller sibling. Citroen has also dedicated a lot of time to improving the C5’s aerodynamics. The car is peppered with flaps and inlets that are designed to smooth out the air passing over the bodywork. The rear bumper is particularly clever, though. It partly reverses the direction of the air that would normally get trapped behind the panel and create drag. The result? You get a little bit of thrust that helps to push the car down the road. No prizes for guessing this one. Like the Peugeot 3008 and Vauxhall Grandland (with which it’ll be competing), the Citroen C5 Aircross concept is built on the platform. That means it’ll be available with a choice of petrol, hybrid and electric powertrains. And that’s no bad thing considering how poor consumer confidence has been in EV tech of late. Citroen hasn’t yet broken down the new C5’s engine range but, given how deep the synergies run within Stellantis, we can figure that out for ourselves. It’ll mirror that of its chassis siblings. The C5 range should open with a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine that’s supported by a 28bhp 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Above that will be a powertrain with a maximum electric range of around 50 miles. At the top of the tree, we’ll get a full EV powered by a massive 98kWh battery pack offering an official WLTP driving range of more than 400 miles. And because this is a car from comfort-focused Citroen, the next C5’s chassis will be propped up by some exceptionally forgiving suspension. Citroen hasn’t yet explained the setup, but the brand promises the finished car will allow five occupants to ‘relax and travel in complete serenity.’ We’ll be judge of that, Citroen.

It’s a model that’s already on sale in China, with its Euro-spec version making its public debut at the . It seems as if cars like Porsche’s new and its sibling, as well as the , are in BYD’s sights with the Sealion 7. It’s a rakish and sharply-designed crossover that shares a similar footprint to those European(ish) rivals, and features the same Blade battery tech also seen in BYD’s other cars. When the Sealion officially goes on sale, it’ll be available with a range of different powertrains. BYD points to the flagship for now, which features twin-motor all-wheel drive power good for a 0-62mph sprint time of 4.5 seconds. On top of that, the Sealion can be charged at up to 230kW and features a heat pump as standard. The Sealion also shares a lot of tech and engineering from BYD’s other cars like the . It’s 10mm longer and 160mm taller than the Seal saloon, and the Sealion shares a lot of the same technology. The usual glut of safety kit seen on every BYD is included here, too, as is the brand’s rather gimmicky rotating infotainment screen. In Europe, the Sealion will go on sale later in October 2024, with the first deliveries arriving at the end of the year. Prices and more details will be announced later.

The brand has revealed the flagship Aceman model at . Aceman JCW models naturally feature a sporty bodykit with a lot of John Cooper Works branding, with plenty of black trimmings. New, rather retro-looking wheels are bespoke to the JCW model, as are red brake calipers and a red roof. The new Aceman includes ‘motorsport technology’ from John Cooper Works here and remains electric-only like . Here, the Aceman JCW features 254bhp and 252lb ft of torque – both only a smidge more than the Aceman S – and is capable of a 6.4sec 0-62mph time and a top speed of 124mph. It’s worth noting, though, that the max power figure is only available via a boost button on the steering wheel. Mini claims a maximum range of 243 miles, and a 95kW charging rate means a 10-80 per cent charge done in around 30 minutes. Inside, not much has changed beyond the regular Aceman. There’s a lot more black and red in here, mind you, and features new upholstery designs for the sporty seats. The brand also points to illuminated headlining being a neat addition, so even Mini’s team are clutching at straws here. The new Aceman has been revealed at the same time as the electric Cooper JCW. Mini says the new Aceman JCW will be available to order towards the end of October 2024. First UK deliveries are expected in April 2025, with prices starting from £40,220.

The Optiq launches using Cadillac’s modern design cues that are also seen on the Lyriq and , with a large ‘grille’ arrangement flanked by two verdical headlight strips at the front, large wheels and rear light designs that morph into the bodywork. Inside, the Optiq’s design is very similar to that of the Lyriq, with Cadillac pointing out that it’s ‘the most progressive interior’ the brand has made with a bounty of recycled materials used. While European specs are still TBC, technology like a massive 33-inch infotainment display that runs a Google-derived system, an AKG audio system and loads of driver assistance tech like GM’s Super Cruise ( ) is available. Cadillac says Super Cruise ‘will be available in Europe after it receives the required approvals.’ Under the skin is the General Motors Ultium platform – the one-size-fits-all battery-electric architecture used by all of GM’s brands. For the Optiq in the US market, Cadillac says it features an 85kWh battery pack and features two electric motors generating 300bhp and 354lb ft of torque, and the brand says it estimates a circa-300-mile range.

256,The new Audi Q5 Sportback now looks slightly more like a coupe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q5-sportback/,Ted Welford,2024-11-26,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has revealed the new version of its Q5 Sportback, the sleeker coupe-like version of its best-selling SUV. Following on from the in September 2024, the Sportback arrives for those wanting something more stylish next to the very strait-laced standard car. Prices start from £52,450, with orders opening in January 2025. Here’s what you need to know. Yes, Audi loves an SUV ‘coupe’ even more than its fellow brands BMW and Mercedes, with the Q5 Sportback being one of five cars in this bodystyle available, including the electric Q4 and models. Though the standard Q5 has been around for three generations, the Sportback is now entering its second iteration, with this new model having a sleeker look than its predecessor. The rear of this new Q5 Sportback is more rounded than before, with the roofline more tapered and like a ‘coupe’ than the previous model. In turn, it brings it closer to its closest rivals, the and . A large Singleframe grille is present and correct, too, along with Audi’s trademark fancy LED lighting. The Q5 Sportback’s interior mirrors that of its SUV counterpart, and is quite a significant departure from the outgoing car. It ushers in Audi’s new curved interior layout, comprising a new 14.5-inch infotainment screen with an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster. Both are quite different to the firm’s well-established, outgoing system, and the passenger can also have their own touchscreen for the first time on a Q5. Unsurprisingly, the new Q5 Sportback isn’t quite as practical as the standard SUV, though its practicality matches that of the previous coupe version of this SUV. The boot offers 510 litres, just 10 less than standard Q5, and extends to 1,415 litres with the rear seats folded. The Q5 Sportback adopts Audi’s latest 48-volt mild-hybrid system, which allows you to can manoeuvre and park on electricity. It brings a small power bump too, but more noticeably a reduction in fuel consumption. Engine choice consists of a 201bhp 2.0-litre petrol, a 201bhp 2.0-litre diesel and the 362bhp 3.0-litre petrol in the sporty SQ5. Two plug-in hybrids, producing 295bhp and 367bhp, will follow in 2025, and are expected to deliver an electric range of around 50 miles. The specs mirror of those of the regular Q5, with a choice of Sport, S line and Edition 1 trim levels, with Sportback prices commanding a £2,500 premium over the SUV. The range starts at £52,450 for the petrol, £54,100 for the diesel and a significant £76,900 for the SQ5. Orders will open on January 14 in the UK, with first deliveries expected in May 2025.

277,Honda's new hybrid Prelude to land in Europe in 2026 with dual-clutch-mimicking CVT,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/honda/prelude-concept/,Jake Groves,2024-12-17,Car Magazine UK,"Honda’s Prelude returns. The new sporty(ish) coupe was first revealed as a concept at the beginning of 2024, with the brand saying the production model will arrive in Europe ‘in the first half of 2026.’ It’s the first time the Prelude name has been used since the fifth-generation Honda coupe ended production at the end of 2001. As of December 2024, Honda has confirmed the new-generation coupe as a hybrid model, almost certainly using the same architecture as the current as a strong base. That means the new Prelude will use a CVT – just like all other current non-BEV Hondas currently on sale. With the Prelude, though, Honda says it is including the brand’s ‘S+ Shift’ technology, which is designed to ‘simulate the sound and feel of quick automatic gear changes,’ mimicking the shifts of a dual-clutch transmission. The brand has also pointed to models like the and the to give us hints about the Prelude’s driving dynamics. ‘In a time where everybody’s talking about electrification and low carbon, we wanted to express Honda’s DNA and provide a real joy of driving. What car can better express that than a sporty coupe?’, Tomoyuki Yamagami, the Prelude’s large project lead, tells CAR. The look of the new Prelude is pretty much set, previewed by the red concept car that made its public debut at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed. We’ve been up close to the red car, which is relatively small when you’re stood next to it. Honda’s design team have focused on keeping the car low to the ground and as aerodynamic as possible. ‘It’s designed to be low and wide,’ says Yamagami, ‘and we’ve been inspired by gliders, and we’ve made sure not to include many gimmicks in the design.’ While we can’t see its interior yet, Honda promises a low driving position, with Yamagami confirming to us that the new Prelude will be a four-seater. Sporty details like brakes from Brembo will be included, and the ‘Prelude’ badge on the back is in a classic Honda script. The Prelude has always had a history of utilising existing Honda architectures and technologies under the skin. We expect the new-generation Prelude to deploy the Civic’s hybrid powertrain when it launches. ‘The new Prelude unifies all of the DNA you’d expect from Honda,’ adds Yamagami. ‘We’ve carefully selected the technology to be utilised here, and we’re imagining a potential customer that uses the car not just for track days, but every day.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

278,Mercedes is testing in-motor brakes for EVs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-in-motor-brakes/,Jake Groves,2024-12-18,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes is looking to the future of electric cars, and is investigating how it can reduce the weight and complexity of an EV by engineering brakes into an e-motor thereby removing traditional discs in the wheel hubs. Other benefits, Mercedes says, include a reduction in maintenance, aerodynamic improvements and a reduction in brake dust particulates – that latter point being a key improvement for Euro7 emissions standards. ‘The bottom line is, even with high energy regeneration when slowing down with an EV, we still need a friction brake,’ says Christoph Schildhauer, lead engineer on the in-motor brake project. ‘Around 98 per cent of braking [with our EVs] are below 0.3G, but the ones that are above that are harder to handle, so we still need physical brakes for the last two per cent. ‘That explains two things in the market of EVs,’ adds Schildhauer. ‘It explains why customers are reporting rust on the rear wheel axle brakes, and that recuperation allows us to design a brake concept to last a car’s lifetime.’ Merc’s new braking system, then, is integrated into an electric motor. For the engineering demo, the team have added on an in-motor brake to the same electric drive unit that is used on the new Mercedes Modular Architecture – the platform that will and three more models. It’s still a physical disc brake, but a smaller one and one where the brake pad covers 100 per cent of the rotating disc, rather than a section in conventional disc brakes. Mercedes claims that is ‘subject to minimal wear, doesn’t rust and is virtually maintenance-free.’ ‘A conventional disc brake is around 22kg,’ says Schildhauer. ‘If we take this weight [times four] out of the car, we’re estimating around 40 per cent less unsprung mass, improving driving comfort and lighter dampers. Also, if you have a lighter wheel, it means you can accelerate faster.’ The idea also potentially frees up wheel and car design. Conventional brake discs need cooling, either via the wheel designs themselves or via ducts in the car – if not both. But if it still uses a conventional brake pad and disc, just hidden away, what about brake dust that will be still emitted? ‘The brake dust generated will be stored into a cavity in the unit, which designed to hold a lifetime of dust,’ adds Schildhauer. Ah, yes – a ‘lifetime.’ How does Mercedes define that? ‘We say that’s around 300,000km, or 15 years,’ Schildhauer responds. Far longer than the average someone owns a car for in some cases, but only in some cases. What happens if someone has their car for longer, and needs to have the dust cavity emptied, repair or replace the brake components? That’s the part Mercedes is still working on. ‘For us, the design for good service quality is important, so we want to make sure that the effort for servicing the car is as little as possible,’ says Schildhauer. For now, Mercedes is keen to stress that this is still in the experimental phases, and isn’t likely to launch onto a car in the near future. But it shows how far into the future Mercedes engineers are looking. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

279,‘We push to get closer to the essence of motion’ – CAR interviews Ferrari boss Benedetto Vigna,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ferrari/benedetto-vigna/,Ben Miller,2024-12-23,Car Magazine UK,"ontrary to the way in which Ferrari is run in my Hollywood-affected head (murderous glances and Machiavellian moves behind dark glasses; dimly-lit offices thick with smoke and the ever-present threat of an outburst) Benedetto Vigna looks at peace with the world, happy in his work and content in his new role as Maranello’s lucky mascot… Two days prior to our conversation he made an appearance on my TV, beaming on the grid in the rapturous wake of Charles Leclerc’s unexpected win at Monza. A few hours later a won the World Endurance Championship event at COTA, Texas. Unbelievably it was the first time in history Ferrari has won two FIA world championship races in the same weekend. ‘That will forever be a historical date for me,’ smiles Vigna. ‘We won in F1, we won in endurance and it was three years to the day since I joined Ferrari as CEO. It was the best gift I could get. I told Charles, “Thank you for this!” ‘After the Grand Prix I had about 3000 WhatsApp messages: tifosi, investors, competitors, friends from many periods of my life… For us the old saying [win on Sunday, sell on Monday] is partially true, for the luxury goods and the merchandising. There is no relation to [car] sales or the share price. But it’s a good reminder. One guy contacted me, the head of a big investment fund. He told me that when you see this ocean of people, standing with these huge flags bearing the Ferrari shield, everyone understands in that moment the power – the real power – of the brand.’ Vigna has spent his first three years at Ferrari leading it, nurturing it, gently challenging it – and learning it. ‘You cannot understand Ferrari until you are in it. You think you understand it from the visible elements, like Formula 1, but you do not. I’ve learned that it means family – you are never alone when you work for Ferrari. And yes, it is intense, but my previous life [with STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor corporation] was also intense. There, the biggest challenge was having the same number of people [as at Ferrari] but spread over 20 locations. My life before was one week in Asia, one week in Europe, one week in the US, all year round… I never had an August vacation in my life! At least here it’s a little easier because most of the people are here in Maranello. ‘The biggest challenge here is communication management, because everything you do in this company – positive or negative – is amplified a lot. When you are in a tech company the communication is only about one thing: performance. Here there are three dimensions: the performance, the beauty and the storytelling associated, because this is a luxury company.’ A couple of years ago, then new to the role, Vigna was cautious when he spoke. He’s more comfortable now, happy to expand on the ideas and concepts his restless mind fires out like so much cerebral radiation. He also reads a lot, particularly now he has a summer break. Recent material includes a book on automotive history – ‘everything since the horse’ – and Chris Miller’s Chip War. ‘Ferrari debuted the 125 S the same year, 1947, that Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first transistor. I worked in that world for 25 years but reading this book I understood many things I was not able to connect previously; how the technology has evolved, its impact on the geopolitical equilibrium, on the global economy… Reading those two books together I was able to connect many dots.’ Does his technology background put Ferrari at an advantage? ‘Coming from a high-tech space gives me three advantages. I understand the technology – this is important because otherwise you end up spending a lot of money for nothing. When I arrived the CFO told me to look at the infotainment system, where the company was spending millions. I was able to deliver a big saving. Also, when you work in the semiconductor space, you work with the whole world; Korea, Taiwan, America. I came from a business that was already doing this. The third advantage is open innovation. In the semiconductor space you can proceed so fast because of open innovation.’ The ‘move fast and break things’ mantra, originally coined by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, came to define the unthinking recklessness of big tech. Fortunately, Vigna’s take is more thoughtful. ‘I like Shakespeare: nimble thought can jump land and sea. Innovation cannot have a hit rate of 100 per cent. What is important is that you try, you learn and adapt nimbly. There is always a thin red line. It’s like when you are driving fast in a curve, trying to understand the limit of the car. Push too hard and you are out; fail to push hard enough and you lose time.’ Vigna’s Ferrari is pushing pretty hard. In the next 16 months we’ll see a LaFerrari successor and the EV. To the latter, despite Lamborghini apparently being in no hurry and Aston’s announcement it’s put full-electric on the backburner, Vigna remains committed. ‘When you have nothing it is a good excuse to postpone,’ he smiles, in reference to rivals’ reticence. But the first Ferrari in history without an engine is a huge deal, and it arrives on his watch. Does that not keep him awake at night? ‘Let me tell you, the weight of responsibility is always there regardless of the powertrain, because there are 5000 people in the company, there are other people associated and there is the brand. Never in my career have I had success by taking my time. There was this guy in history, Quinto Fabio Massimo – he used that strategy with Hannibal and he lost… We selected this approach and invested because we believe this is something important, not for the technology per se but for its ability to touch people’s emotions. This is not new to me. In my career I’ve always developed new technology starting with the end user. Enzo Ferrari was not an engineer. Steve Jobs was not an engineer. But they understood this. ‘We develop new technologies out of a desire to improve the quality of life, not only from a utility point of view but also for fun. The electric car will do this. I have driven it and it is something unique. When you talk about electric cars today you’re generally talking about something heavy and okay on linear acceleration. But when you go lateral acceleration, the feeling in the body, the gyroscope in the ears, this is decoupled and you do not feel well. The people making electric cars today have to optimise the cost – we have the luxury of not having to do this. And in any case the electric car will be an additional platform, so we leave the freedom of choice to our client – it is not an imposition.’ Ferrari remains committed to a portfolio of powertrains, its 2030 projection a range split 20 per cent combustion, 40 per cent electric and 40 per cent hybrid. ‘Technology transitions are never digital; they require time,’ says Vigna. ‘This is why we said we would add the electric platform to hybrid and internal combustion engines. ‘My other key decisions [to date] have been to not increase sales volumes, because you lose the essence of the brand, and not to grow too much in China, because you need the market to get acquainted with the brand at the right speed. Another was the decision to do the e-building, which is compatible with our strategy and is also an environmental decision. This is now a key metric. For every component we know the cost, the timing, the quality and the carbon footprint. This is important.’ Really? This from a company that sells 6.5-litre V12s no one needs? ‘In the early days of my career I did not understand the value of it. But now I think we have to leave a better world to our next generation. There is also extra responsibility when you are a luxury-goods company, making things that are by definition not useful. Luxury companies can push innovation because of their price point and they can have a cultural impact because of our profile. This is an important dimension: we can show the world that this transition can be done. But we want to do it in a scientific way. It is a complex challenge. I don’t like to talk about green cars – to say a car has zero impact because there is no exhaust.’ Vigna drives plenty of Ferraris. ‘I have done a lot more driving since I joined. I am ready for F1 now…’ he laughs. ‘In July I drove the , a 166 MM, the Testarossa of 1957, the electric car, the and I did a big trip in the I have, from the north of Italy to the south.’ Given the awesome performance of cars like the 296 and the 12Cilindri, must each new Ferrari continue to outperform the last? ‘Progress is intrinsic in any company that wants to have sustainable success – to enjoy a sustainable advantage. When you drive the and the 12Cilindri, as I have, you see the difference and you perceive the difference. The best car will always be the next one. We push for continuous improvement, to get closer to the essence of motion. I don’t think this process will ever reach an end.’ The untapped potential in software excites Vigna, as you might imagine given his background (his first work with Ferrari pre-dates his appointment as CEO, when his team created the battery management system for the ). ‘There is much more to the software side than perhaps people think. You have basic software, like closing the windows, and you have the human interface. With this we just mirror what is on your phone, like a smart TV. Autonomous? We do only what is required by regulation. But there is also vehicle dynamics, and here we invest with our engineers, physicists and mathematicians to make something unique. We do not yet fully understand the relationship between the input from outside and the perception in the brain – the psychophysics. If a level of acceleration is beyond what it is possible to perceive, what is the point? There are some things as human beings we are not able to perceive. But the electronics must see it, for the stability of the car. We are looking at two things: the high frequency, for the dynamic control of the vehicle; and the lower frequency, for the enjoyment of the driver.’ As we navigate the Maranello site, forever a work in progress ( ; work is underway on a new paint facility) Vigna greets colleagues constantly. So warm and frequent are the interactions that my British cynicism immediately questions their authenticity. After two hours I’m forced to admit they’re likely genuine. Is his a warmer Ferrari? ‘We work together with Dallara on the 499P. After we won in Le Mans last year, I called Giampaolo Dallara to thank him on behalf of Ferrari. And you know he started to cry. He told me that in decades of working with us this was the first time Ferrari had thanked him. This is something we need to understand: that at the centre of everything are the people, and not all of these people wear the Ferrari badge. Very often there is something that cannot happen unless you have the right sponsor, the right partner.’ Perhaps Ferrari has been guilty of arrogance in the past? ‘A little bit, yes. This is a change in philosophy, and it helps that I was a supplier. You want the full motivation of your suppliers, and to get that you need to make them feel important and engaged. As soon as they feel exploited you don’t get the maximum, you get the minimum.’ Refreshingly, Vigna rubbishes the notion that becoming CEO of Ferrari was the culmination of some lifelong dream, Hollywood style. ‘I never thought I would become the CEO of any company. When I hear people saying that it was always their ambition I cannot believe this. I think if you do things in which you can express yourself the best, in terms of creativity, this is important. When you can do something that involves you from a rational point of view and, most importantly, from an emotional point of view, too, this is satisfying. Then, if you are lucky, you become the CEO. But this is not the most important thing. The important things are that you have fun, that you give your best and that you have fun working with other people. This is something that I’m doing here in Ferrari.’ Appointed CEO at a young age by the tycoon Gianni Agnelli himself in 1991, Luca di Montezemolo – immaculately dressed, well educated and very well mannered – arrived a year after Amedeo Felisa. The latter was the marque’s long-time CTO and, in cahoots with di Montezemolo, architect of the ingenious fully scalable aluminium architecture that underpinned the highly profitable brand-shaping 550/575/599/F12/812 V12s and the equally successful mid/rear-engined V8 bloodline that began with the F355. Opposed to an SUV, Luca also re-iterated just a few months before his departure his fervent belief that Ferrari must maintain exclusivity by staying under 7000 units a year… Sergio showed up to meetings in baggy corduroys and a black sweater, a pair of buzzing phones in one hand and a smouldering Muratti cigarette in the other. The anti-di Montezemolo in so many ways, he handled Ferrari differently, too. Felisa was a Montezemolo man so Marchionne hired Michael Leiters from Porsche to run R&D. The first priority was that dreaded SUV, , and the money-spinning SP cars. Sergio’s profit-orientated approach proved that higher volumes did not make Ferrari’s cars any less desirable – stopgap CEO Louis Camilleri and current boss Vigna have stuck to the same formula.

340,New Kia EV4: wildly designed electric car comes as saloon and hatch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/ev4/,James Dennison,2025-02-27,Car Magazine UK,"► Kia has unveiled its EV4 hatchback and saloon models with a headline 391-mile range from the larger battery versions. It marks the South Korean manufacturer’s first foray into the electrified saloon and hatchback market and represents an unusual step away from the trend of electric SUVs. But let’s cut to the chase, because while the hatchback enjoys a more conventional design the saloon is sporting a rear end for the ages. From some angles, it’s the sort of protrusion that would make a certain member of the Kardashian family blush – yet there’s clearly strong aero benefits to such an eye-catching look. The EV4 Saloon has the legs on its Hatchback counterpart when it comes to range and luggage space, so there’s function to go along with the form. How does the rest of the car fare on paper? Keep reading to find out. In the battle of who can fit the biggest interior screen, Kia has gone on the offensive and delivered a combined screen size of 30 inches. Sounds huge on paper, whereas in reality a 12.3-inch infotainment display and digital dashboard plus a further 5.3-inch unit is much more palatable. Kia’s smartphone-based Digital Key 2.0 is also available and allows up to 15 devices, including an Apple Watch, to unlock your car. Meanwhile, over-the-air updates are now possible, while Vehicle Smart TV allows users to watch streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix and Disney+ in 21:9 ratio using the primary central screen. It’s not all entertainment, however, as the EV4 also has a Rest Mode that utilises the front relaxation seats and mood lamp to create what Kia calls a ‘comforting atmosphere’. Equally, there’s also a Theatre Mode that does the opposite and employs the optional eight-speaker Harmon Kardon sound system for the full movie-goer experience. As with the vast majority of new cars, semi-autonomous safety kit is in abundance with Highway Driving Assist, Lane Following Assist, Remote Parking Assist, Direct Grip Direction System (senses contact between the steering wheel and the driver’s hands to tell if they have adequate control of the vehicle) and a 12-inch windshield head-up display also included. Both the hatchback and saloon variants of the EV4 will be available with a two different battery options. Namely an entry-level 58.3kWh version and a larger 81.4kWh long range model – both of which will come with the same 150kW motor powering the front wheels. A modest 161bhp power output means 0-62mph in 7.4 seconds (7.7 in the long-range variant) and a max-speed of 170km/h. However, what stands out is the impressive 367- and 391-mile range on the hatchback and saloon long-range models respectively. Meanwhile, a DC fast charge from 10-80% should be achievable in around 30 minutes, while an 11kW AC charge (10-100%) takes between 5hrs 20 mins and 7hrs 15 minds depending on the battery size. Kia is yet to announce the UK pricing and specs for the EV4, but expect a top-level GT Line model and a cheaper Air variant when orders open later in 2025.

217,"Skywell Q: not, as it turns out, a Bond car",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skywell/q/,Jake Groves,2024-10-16,Car Magazine UK,"Skywell, a relatively new car brand from China, is launching a new family hatchback EV for Europe. It’s called the Skywell Q, and it’s designed to rival the likes of the , and . The brand officially launched the car at the . If you’ve not heard of the brand, there’s a little bit of a confusing story behind it. The brand actually trades as Skyworth in Europe, and the Skyworth brand is a major electronics brand in its home market of China. There’s already a Skywell on the way for the UK market – the BE11 SUV, . Anyway, back to the Q. It’s a 4.2m long hatchback with a very rounded and clean design and what the brand calls a ‘generous’ amount of kit and tech on board. Skywell says the battery pack is capable of more than 300 miles of range there’s a 201bhp electric motor on the front wheels. Interestingly, Skywell claims a 3.9sec 0-62mph sprint time – quite a lot higher than a BYD Dolphin Comfort that also features a 201bhp e-motor, and yet claims a more reasonable seven-second 0-62mph time. The interior is clean and tidy, with what is now becoming quite a traditionally large infotainment screen and high centre console with storage options and cupholders and wireless phone charging capabilities. Skywell says a audio system from Metz – a German audio company – is included. Skywell says the Q hatchback is launching in Europe and the UK, with a UK launch expected in the autumn of 2025.

218,"429bhp Nissan Ariya Nismo gets priced... and it's cheaper than we thought",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/ariya-nismo/,Jake Groves,2024-10-16,Car Magazine UK,"First revealed at the 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon as a Japan-only model, the Nissan Ariya Nismo has now been priced and is available to pre-order in the UK. With a name like that, it ought to be one of the sportiest on the market. But we have out doubts. In fact, the Ariya Nismo is intended to help mark the 40th anniversary of Nissan’s performance and racing arm. It will now be the only model equipped with the Nismo badge in Europe, the have now been discontinued in the region. is not being sold in Europe, either. No sugaring the pill, the Ariya Nismo costs from £56,620. That is only £1,780 more than the previously range-topping Ariya Evolve, and the difference includes upgrading the painfully named e-4ORCE all-wheel-drive system offered on both cars from 301bhp to 429bhp. So comparatively speaking it doesn’t seem bad value, and actually cheaper than the £65k we were initially projecting. However, it’s also still not very fast for a performance flagship in 2024, with 0-62mph taking five whole seconds it seems. The 50-70mph in 2.4sec, however, is said to be quicker than the R35 Nismo can manage. In that specific moment up to the UK motorway limit, it’s lightning. As you’d expect from a Nismo, Nissan has been over the exterior with a red marker pen to emphasise the bodykit, which includes chunky front and rear bumpers plus side skirts. There’s also a motorsport-inspired central rear fog light. The red carries on inside, across the dashboard, centre console and door cards, and stitched into the heavily bolstered seats. In Japan, there have been two power variants: a ‘B6’ model developing 362bhp and the ‘B9’ variant pushing out 429bhp. The UK is only getting the faster model. A new Nismo driving mode can be activated inside the car, giving a performance boost and a Formula E-inspired soundtrack to match. The e-4ORCE system, meanwhile, is combined with what’s described as ‘finely tuned suspension’ for ‘a superb drive no matter the weather’. The steering is said to be more direct and engaging, too. And just in case that’s not enough to get people flocking into dealerships, Nissan is offering the first 100 customers in the UK a limited-edition Ariya Nismo print by Juan Alcalá Lara, who also does the artwork for Nissan’s Formula E team. First deliveries are set for early 2025. We’re not sure the extraordinary will be losing much sleep over the Ariya’s arrival, but that is considerably more expensive as well.

219,Can a Porsche 911 Turbo S be faster than at the ‘Ring than GT3 RS? The RML P39 thinks so,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rml-p39/,Graham King,2024-10-16,Car Magazine UK,"A Porsche 911 GT3 RS can lap the Nurburgring Nordschleife in six minutes 49.3 seconds. British motorsport engineering firm RML has set itself the rather ambitious target of beating that time with a car based on the 992.1-generation , the RML P39 40SE you see here. The Turbo S isn’t necessarily the best starting point for building a ‘Ring weapon. It’s more of a cruise missile to the ’s fighter jet, as evidenced by its comparatively leisurely seven minutes 17 seconds ‘Ring time. But RML thinks it has unlocked the car’s potential with the P39 40SE. The most obvious change over the standard Turbo S is the new bodywork. Made entirely from carbonfibre, RML says the look is inspired by the current generation of Le Mans Hypercars. The P39’s panels are stretched and pumped in every direction; you’ll immediately spot the roof scoop that feeds air to the rear-mounted engine, the lack of a back window and the gigantic rear spoiler. There are more subtle changes, as well. The front and rear track are widened and even the wheelbase has increased by 25mm. Active aero front and rear features, plus the driver can activate a drag-reduction system. The suspension drops to increase high-speed downforce, as well. None of it’s just for show, either. RML claims the P39 generates 662kg of downforce at 150mph – over half a ton more than the standard 911 Turbo S generates. At 177mph, downforce is an immense 923kg. There’s extra power, too. Upgraded turbos, intercoolers, manifolds and catalytic converters, a new ECU and a unique Inconel exhaust liberate 900bhp from the 3.8-litre flat-six engine, up from 641hp in the Turbo S. 0-60mph and 0-100mph have increased by only a few tenths, but that’s not the key to unlocking a fast lap. Add it all together and RML claims the P39 40SE can lap the Nordschleife in six minutes 45 seconds. That was achieved in pre-production simulations – we’ll have to wait and see what it can achieve in real life. It’s not just about lap times. Switch the P39 out of track mode into tour mode, and RML reckons it’s pretty much as comfortable for a long haul as the Turbo S. Racing seats with four-point harnesses are fitted and the back seat is ditched for a half-cage. RML’s own shade of Ruby Red paint and bespoke forged alloy wheels are available as options. RML (which stands for Ray Mallock Ltd.) is one of the UK’s most successful motorsport firms. It has built and run touring cars, prototypes and rally cars with huge success all over the globe. It’s also a highly respected design and engineering consultancy working with a vast array of racing teams and OEMs. It branched out into low-volume road cars a few years ago when it launched the , an homage to the iconic Ferrari 250GT SWB based on the 550 Maranello. The RML P39 40SE marks the firm’s 40 anniversary. Just 10 will built at a cost of £495,000 plus local taxes and a donor car. Form an orderly queue.

220,The new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe is now less ugly than before,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/2-series-gran-coupe/,Ted Welford,2024-10-16,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has revealed a second generation of its niche-busting 2 Series Gran Coupe, bringing a significant styling revision inside and out, and reduced engine choice for 2025. Heavily based on the new BMW 1 Series, the Gran Coupe is a stretched, bolder bodystyle that sells particularly well in the US and Asian markets. BMW has worked to address styling concerns of its predecessor, and overhauled the interior with its new Curved Display. The 2 Series Gran Coupe has the lowest average customer age owner of any BMW, and style sells to a younger audience. The firm acknowledges the previous car’s design was quite divisive and has worked to give it a sportier look with a neater roofline and less awkward rear end. It’s still not what you’d call pretty, not least with its wider grille with an optional illuminated surround. It’s slightly longer and taller than its predecessor, too, offering slightly more space in the rear than before, though it’s still quite tight for adults – if roomier than a fairly cramped 1 Series. The rear is much cleaner than its predecessor, too. The interior of the 2 Series Gran Coupe is the biggest change, and almost mirrors that of a new 1 Series with a decluttered and more modern cabin courtesy of BMW’s well-used Curved Display. It’s running the firm’s latest operating system too, including more shortcut buttons. A 10.25-inch instrument cluster and 10.7-inch touchscreen are standard across the range, as is fancy ambient interior lighting on the door panels. New sports seats are fitted as standard, trimmed in Alcantara and artificial leather, which BMW promises improved ‘long-distance comfort’. BMW is slimming down its engine line-up and trim structure on just about every car it sells and the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is no exception. Previously you could have it with a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but now it will only be petrol available, with the 220 and M235 available. All models now use a seven-speed automatic gearbox, too, with the only manual BMW models sold in the UK now being the Z4 and M2. The 220 is a 1.5-litre turbocharged unit that adopts mild-hybrid for the first time, with a small electric motor integrated directly into the gearbox. As a whole, it develops 168bhp, enabling a 7.9-second 0-62mph time. Above this sits the M235, which is all-wheel-drive. Its 302bhp 2.0-litre petrol engine is slightly detuned compared to its predecessor (blame emission regulations), but can still manage the 62mph sprint in 4.9 seconds. Trim level choice comes down to which engine you choose, with the 220 coming exclusively in M Sport trim and the M235 being its own model. Standard equipment includes the Curved Display, adaptive sports suspension and a reversing camera. You mainly pay for the M235’s engine, but it also brings a sports steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock marker, quad exhaust system and more aggressive styling kit. Orders for the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe are now open, with first deliveries expected in March 2025. Prices for the 220 start from £34,915, and the M235 xDrive is available from £44,435.

221,"‘I don’t need incentives, I need plugs’: Imparato on the future of Alfa Romeo",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/imparato-on-the-future-of-alfa/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-10-17,Car Magazine UK,"Jean-Phillippe Imparato, Alfa Romeo’s irrepressibly charismatic leader, has moved on to pastures new. He’s now Stellantis’ European CEO, which means the buck stops with him for all twelve brands the group hawks on the continent. And I’d bet both my kidneys this promotion has made him the busiest man in the motoring industry. Somehow, I managed to carve an hour out of his packed schedule at the to quiz him on the biggest challenges awaiting him in his new role. As a bonus, I found a bit of time to get an update on the health of the brand he’s leaving. The next few years will be anything but easy for Imparato. He’s battling with tightening EV sales mandates, fresh competition from China and stubborn legislators – but, in typical fashion, he already knows which doors he must boot off their hinges to get things done. Keep reading to learn more about what’s going on in Jean-Phillippe’s head. I’d say he has but, as always, he wasn’t vulgar about his achievements. He humbly said: ‘You are never safe in any state of business, but what we can say is that we are making a profit of several hundreds of millions. So, on that side we are back.’ Imparato is immensely proud of the fact that Alfa Romeo is holding its own because, before he arrived in 2019, it was losing money hand over fist. He turned the brand’s fortunes around quickly – no doubt motivated by Carlos Tavares’ promise to put Alfa’s neck on the chopping block if it didn’t start pulling its weight. ‘The first decision we made in 2021 was to bring the market a B-segment crossover SUV for families that would support Alfa Romeo through this transition phase,’ Imparato told me. ‘From everything that I see, seems to do the job.’ At the time of writing, Alfa Romeo had sold more than 10,000 Juniors – but the car had hardly been on sale for a month. For a company that could barely cover its costs a few years ago, that’s good progress. But this is just the beginning of Alfa’s comeback. Imparato is handing his successor a detailed product strategy that’ll hopefully ensure Alfa Romeo remains profitable well into the next decade. He explained: ‘To make money, we have a plan. Next step, Stelvio. Next step, Giulia. Next step, Tonale in 2027. And then something else.’ I couldn’t convince Imparato to reveal exactly what that ‘something else’ was, but he’s previously disclosed to CAR magazine that he’ll ‘ in 2027. I suspect this car will be a huge electric SUV, built on STLA Large, designed to rival the likes of the and . Jean-Phillippe was rather coy about what’s coming after 2027, but he was adamant that, whatever it is, Alfa Romeo won’t return to the most affordable vehicle segments. He won’t build a car on Stellantis’ Smart Car Platform. ‘Alfa on Smart Car? No. They have Citroen. They have Fiat. No problem,’ he said. ‘We will fight against the – I would say – the generalists of the world. We have Leapmotor to fight against the Chinese, so allow me with Alfa Romeo to fight the premium [end] of the market with primarily STLA Large.’ Not at all. He had a hilarious ‘come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough’ attitude to his new-found competitors, for which my respect is boundless. He’s also not convinced that the will dam the tsunami of fresh metal crashing in from the east. In his own words, he reckons the extra duty will provide a ‘short-term impact, long-term nothing.’ He elaborated, saying: ‘In the 80s and 90s, we were talking about Toyota, no? Japanese invasion. Bon. 2000 and 2010 was to care about what? Korean! Did you stop them? Did any tariffs stop them? No. It didn’t. Now, it’s Chinese and we [are] prepared. We cannot imagine that we can stop anything by applying tariffs.’ And, strategically at least, Stellantis is playing chess while its European competitors are still fiddling with Lego. In fact, Stellantis is now a part of the Chinese invasion, as it has a controlling interest in a European distribution network for the Suspicious, no? Well, at Paris, I chatted to Francesco Giacalone, head of marketing for the Leapmotor joint venture, who said the brand will more than likely help Stellantis develop its electric car tech in the future. I appreciate how cynical this sounds, but it’s almost as if Stellantis knew it couldn’t beat its Chinese rivals – so it joined them. Clever. Imparato was very vocal about the lack of support his company (and, indeed the automotive industry as a whole) has received from local governments – especially where charging infrastructure is concerned. ‘We need clarity,’ he said. ‘You hear me? What you want?’ He continued, sporting his best impersonation of a clueless lawmaker: ‘I want to fight against global warming, but I want to stay in the ICE because at the end of the day – You want to fail the CO2 emissions? Yes, or no? Okay where are the charging stations, my friend? You don’t care. I can bring the EVs, but give me the charging stations, no? .’ ‘You want us to invest and build EVs? Please give me plugs. Please give me fast charging. Give me 800 volts. Because when you have 700km (435 miles) of range, 18 minutes charging time and 900 horsepower, I can’t even compare electrified cars to ICE. 954 horsepower. 18 minutes to charge. 700 kilometres. It. Is. Not a problem. Anymore. But I need to charge.’ He’s a softly spoken yet quietly confident Sicilian chap called Santo Ficili (he’s on the right in the picture below) – and he was very keen to tell me how excited he is that Alfa Romeo has an Italian steering the ship once again. Interestingly, he’ll also oversee Maserati now that Tavares handed the firm’s old boss the sack. That means Alfa and Maserati will be brought closer together, in the hope the former brand’s resurrection strategy will rub off on the latter. It’s no secret that Maserati’s finances have suffered in 2024, with sales falling by 50% compared to 2023. But that doesn’t mean Maserati will be dragged onto the STLA platforms just yet. It’ll remain special for a little while longer, continuing to make use of the Giorgio platform that underpins the , and . Imparato said: ‘Giorgio platform could be interesting as well for Maserati from the next step, you see? So, depending on the architecture they want to put in place and the synergies they want to create with Alfa Romeo. ‘Giorgio is interesting – but the question is, how do I show that it is interesting for an electrified world. But for Maserati, Giorgio platform is still on the table because I think that it can be very interesting for little series of very luxury or – how to say – distinctive cars. But it cannot be a mass market proposition.’ Lots to come, then. And perhaps Duracells won’t power them all.

222,Ferrari F80 unveiled: Maranello’s latest hypercar promises the ultimate in road-car performance,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/f80/,Piers Ward,2024-10-17,Car Magazine UK,"288 GTO, F40, F50, Enzo, and now the ballistic Ferrari F80 – the latest in a long line of hallowed supercars from is being touted as the ultimate expression of Ferrari F1 knowhow for the road. Featuring ground effect and active aero that generates 1000kg of downforce at 155mph and a hybrid V6 turbo that has drawn inspiration from the F1 and WEC racing cars, the F80 is a limited-edition demonstration of supremacy of everything that Ferrari has learnt from its racing and road car programs. But unlike some others that have gone before (the Valkyrie, for instance), Ferrari claims the F80 will be easy to drive. By deliberately setting out to engineer a car that customers will want to use all the time, the firm claims that the F80 will offer the best example of extreme performance and extreme versatility. Quite how often that proves true in reality is probably a moot point, but the £2.6m starting price (plus taxes) means it’s unlikely you’ll see one in your local Tesco car park any time soon. The stats are, predictably, on another level from anything before from Maranello. The 3.0-litre ICE engine produces 888bhp, red lines at 9200rpm and has a specific output of 296bhp per litre (incredibly high, but not quite on the -AMG One level); twin electric motors on the front axle add another 282bhp (and make it permanent four-wheel drive); torque is 627lb ft from the V6 and 178lb ft from the front electric motors; 0-62mph takes just 2.15 seconds and 0-125mph in 5.75 seconds. To put that latter figure in historical context, the LaFerrari was over a second slower. But where the F80 will feel different is in its delivery – by using two fairly large capacity turbos nestled in the middle of the 120-degree V and each gaining an e-motor between the turbine and the compressor, Ferrari promises instant power delivery. It does without variable vane turbos but then they aren’t needed because the e-motors do all the torque fill. Lag shouldn’t be an issue. There’s a further electric motor mounted under the engine, dubbed MGU-K to acknowledge the F1 link, that further boosts power and can be used for regen. Then if you also count the front twin electric motors, it brings to five the number of e-motors just powering the thing. Start to count the motors on the fully active suspension (another four) and the rear wing and you’re into double figures. The F1 association continues with an MGU-H that generates its power from the turbos’ waste gases and a DRS-esque reverse Gurney flap at the front that is capable of stalling the airflow entering the underbody, thereby reducing drag. At the rear, a moveable wing raises and also tilts fore and aft according to driver inputs to the throttle, brakes and steering, in order to either reduce drag or give more downforce. Balancing it all must have meant many hours in the wind tunnel – 1000kg of press needs to be carefully managed across each surface. That’s also the reason for the fully active suspension. Similar in principle to that which operates on the SUV, the Multimatic system can control each corner individually, a vital aspect given how much aero is at play. It also means there are no anti-roll bars. Likewise no rear-wheel steer but with the twin electric front motors allowing for torque vectoring, Ferrari argues it isn’t needed. And it also helps save the weight of complicated rear wheel steer. The chassis is a carbon, aluminium and titanium mix that runs to a dry weight of just 1525kg (a LaFerrari was 1485kg). Being a hybrid, weight was always at the front of Ferrari’s mind, with reduction measures such as 3D printed suspension parts, an integrated cooling system on the front inverter, while Ferrari has also revised the cylinder block, crankcase, timing cover and other components on the V6, as well as employing titanium screws. The result is an engine that weighs the same as the V6 in 296 but produces an additional 234bhp. Further impressive diets are the front axle set-up being 36kg lighter than on the SF90 and the 38kg shaved off the 2.3kWh battery compared to the one in the SF90. Emerging onto the stage at Maranello with predictably dramatic music, the first thing that strikes you about the F80 is how compact the cabin looks. It’s accentuated by the wide shoulders and low stance (the F80 stands just 1138mm tall) and with the low slung rear deck, it screams a razor-sharp purpose that clearly follows on from the F40 and F50 forebears, albeit with modern touches; the black arc across the front is a nod to the recent 12Cilindri. The interior layout is interesting. Ferrari debated making it a single-seater in order to deliver the ultimate driving machine with minimal compromise, but in the end settled on a ‘1+’ seating arrangement that is meant to put the driver slightly further forward. Unlike the , where both seats are fixed and the pedals move, the F80’s arrangement is mixed one: the driver’s seat moves fore and aft but the passenger’s is rigid. Ferrari says this staggered arrangement means the two seats can be positioned closer together because you won’t rub shoulders with your passenger, which also benefits the exterior dimensions as the car can be narrower and therefore more aero efficient. A lot of major controls are mounted on the steering wheel, following Ferrari’s recent trend, but in this instance they’re physical buttons and no longer haptic. Good, as the touch ones in the 296 series are virtually inoperable. Funny you should mention that. It’s going to be a bumper time in the hypercar class as the F80 has been announced barely a month after unveiled the W1. Also featuring a hybrid set-up, only this time with 1258bhp via the rear wheels only, the difference in acceleration figures shows how the alternative approaches to traction will translate on the road. The W1 is 0.55 seconds slower to 62mph but by 100mph, it’s closed the gap to 0.05 seconds. As for the other member of the holy trinity of LaFerrari, McLaren P1 and Porsche 918 Spyder, the Mission X was announced as an all-electric alternative and with a possible launch date of 2027. Now, in the 2020s, you can also add the Bugatti Tourbillon to the list. Previously, the Veyron and Chiron were a class above but thanks to McLaren and Ferrari raising the prices of their cars this time around, it drags in exotica like the Bugatti. Or Koenigsegg.

223,"New Porsche 911 GT3 unveiled: still a 503bhp 4.0-litre flat-six, but now with 4 seats!",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/911-gt3/,James Dennison,2024-10-18,Car Magazine UK,"According to Porsche’s Director of GT cars, Andreas Preuninger, the hardest part about updating the is keeping it as good as the last one. Emissions and safety regulations are constantly evolving, such that maintaining the 503bhp 4.0-litre naturally aspirated flat-six and circa 1.4-tonne kerb weight was a significant challenge. But what about making it than before? ‘We can’t offer more horsepower due to emissions, but we can offer more sensation’ claims Preuninger. Read on to find out Porsche has polished the GT3. For the first time in GT3 history the Weissach pack is available (for around £16k) and brings carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) components such as anti-roll bars, coupling rods and even the roof, plus there’s the option for a CFRP roll cage and magnesium lightweight forged wheels that save 9kg all round. However, if you prefer the version (this is also the first time that both variants have been launched simultaneously), a separate lightweight package is also available (stabiliser, coupling rods and shear panel on the rear axle made from CFRP) for a sum yet to be confirmed. At its lightest, the GT3 comes in at 1,420kg (it was previously 1,418kg) meaning its positioning as the lighter, purer car among its rivals remains intact. We understand a hybrid element was (very briefly) considered, but was quickly dismissed given the 80kg weight penalty. Another feature that Preuninger and his team looked into but didn’t make the cut was different suspension settings for the regular GT3 and Touring. A lot of knowledge went into the suspension’ explains Preuninger. ‘An engineer spent 1.5 years tuning the suspension. We wanted to separate setups but found it was not necessary’ Efforts have also been made to make the steering less nervous around the straight ahead position, while a reduction in pitching when braking from high speeds is designed to deliver the correct aerodynamic balance across the front and rear axles. The idea to push the front ball joint of the lower trailing arm further down on the front axle, meanwhile, was gleaned from the Also noteworthy is an 8% shorter final drive on both the seven-speed PDK and six-speed manual – something designed to enhance the driving sensation. Performance figures remain the same at 0-62mph in 3.4 seconds (PDK) and a 193mph top speed. It sounds like a strange idea, but apparently the most requested feature (by quite some way) from existing GT3 owners was the possibility to have a rear bench. But how does that work with the lightweight bucket seats that Preuninger himself claims are the most important option on the car? Well, Porsche’s gone and made the most flexible bucket seats out there – probably… Not only do they fold to allow access to the rear, they also have an integrated thorax airbag, electric height adjustment, manual longitudinal adjustment, the ability to remove part of the headrest (helpful for when wearing a helmet during track driving) and optional three-stage heating. Styling changes are minimal, but look closely and you’ll spot a re-contoured front diffuser, a slightly different shape on the spoiler lip, tweaked Matrix LED headlights and new angled side plates on the GT3’s wing. Inside, there’s now a fully digital dash (the analogue rev counter has sadly been ditched) but with a revised layout over the old semi-digital dash. This means that the instruments on the far left and right are no longer blocked by the steering wheel. Also nice is the ability to rotate the rev counter so that the 9,000rpm red line is central at 12 o’clock. Neat. Oh, and Porsche’s pretty proud of how easy it is to turn off those pesky (but mandatory) driver assists. They’re merely a button press and a swipe of the touchscreen away from being deactivated. The new GT3 can be ordered from the end of 2024 with first deliveries at some point in the first half of 2025. UK prices start from £157,300, while the Weissach package adds £15,597 or £19,530 with the CFRP roll cage. Pricing for the lightweight package has yet to be confirmed.

224,Hyundai Ioniq 5 N wins best fun car prize at Parkers New Car Awards 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/parkers-new-car-awards-winners/,CAR’s road test team,2024-10-21,Car Magazine UK,"– the definitive resource for car buying advice in the UK – has once again partnered with CAR magazine to bring you the award for the Best Fun Car and Best New Car finance in its prestigious Parkers New Car Awards 2025. This year’s sporting winner is the , and is one of a total of 10 award-winning cars revealed today. This year’s best fun car award couldn’t have gone to any other car, as the battery-powered hot hatch is the year’s biggest leap forward the judges had witnessed in electric car technology – and it’s the only EV that could persuade the most devout petrolheads to flip from pumps to plugs. Luke Wilkinson, deputy editor of our sister website, explains: ‘Why is the Ioniq 5 N such a clear-cut winner? Well, it does an exceptional impression of a petrol-powered hot hatchback. Hyundai has coded a phoney double-clutch gearbox for the car, which is supported by a digital engine note – and it’s remarkably convincing in how well it replicates the violence of a full-throttle upshift or the sensation of high-rev downchange. ‘But the best thing about the car is that doesn’t take itself too seriously. You get the impression it was designed by people who driving. So, the Ioniq 5N has a drive mode whose sole purpose is to make the car do skids – and you get a button on the steering wheel that throws all 650bhp at the wheels for overtaking. It’s hilarious,’ he adds. The winning car has been tested rigorously by the , which judged the best fun cars cars on a combination of feedback, performance, style, cost-per-month on finance deals and sheer desirability. Renault once again picks up an award for Best New Car Finance in the 2025 Parkers New Car Awards. Last year we waxed lyrical about how Renault had remained committed to 0% APR deals and kept its low base rates against industry-wide rises. This year is no different, the best Renaults still being available with 0% APR and really tempting monthly payments. Then there’s the generous deposit contributions available across the board that further help make Renault an industry-leader. Renault even offers zero-deposit options on new cars. The value for money for a new Renault is difficult to overstate. Editor Keith Adams says: ‘In this year’s Parkers New Car Awards, more than half of the winners – as well as our overall champion, the – are electric, which shows a huge shift in the competence and usability of these cars. But we also acknowledge that EVs still won’t work for enough people until we have better and more widespread on-street charging, so the awards are peppered by lots of highly commended petrol and hybrid alternatives.’ Now in its eighth year, the Parkers New Car Awards reflect the constantly-evolving views of Britain’s car-buying public, with winners decided by a combination of the site’s expert reviewers’ verdicts in thousands of miles of road testing and the purchasing habits of the website’s 2.3+ million users actively involved in the car-buying process. More details about the Best Fun Car and Best New Car Finance awards can be found alongside all the winners in the on the Parkers website. CAR magazines staffers are the real deal: we love cars and know the industry inside out. Occasionally, we have to use a generic byline when too many of the team have contributed to an article."
225,Mini Cooper JCW: now available with combustion or electric power from £31k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mini/cooper-jcw/,Jake Groves,2024-10-23,Car Magazine UK,"Mini’s latest John Cooper Works models have arrived, with both combustion or electric models available. Given the Mini Cooper is available as both an electric car and one with engines, it makes sense that the hottest models in the range also get that choice. The new combustion Cooper JCW is a familiar affair with a 225bhp 2.0-litre petrol engine, allowing it to sprint to 62mph in 6.1sec and top out at 155mph. The same engine is applied to the Mini Cooper JCW Convertible, which takes 6.4sec to reach 62mph and makes it to 152mph. The first ever electric Cooper JCW model launched at the alongside the , and the specs show it’s only really a gentle power boost from the model. The Cooper JCW features 254bhp and 252lb ft from its single front axle e-motor, meaning a 5.9sec 0-62mph time and a top speed of 124mph. However, that max power figure is only available via a boost function using a rocker switch on the steering wheel. As for range and charging, Mini says the electric Cooper JCW can drive up to 251 miles on a single charge, and can be charged at up to 95kW. That means, according to Mini, a 10-80 per cent charge is done in around half an hour. Visually, it sort of feels like Mini’s queered its own pitch with the Cooper S Sport models already on sale; the JCW editions (regardless of engine choice) doesn’t look particularly different or much sportier. That said, the JCW models feature details like a red roof, bespoke alloy wheel designs, a checkered flag motif on the tailgate and some racing stripes on the bonnet. Notice how even less has changed with the Convertible’s design given the brake lights are the same as the previous model, laying bare that this generation of Mini really is a heavy facelift. Inside, little is different besides a bespoke JCW fabric for the sporty standard seating, and what Mini describes as illuminated headlining. The interior is full of red and black colouring and Mini’s now traditional patterned details. Want one? You can order one now in any engine form, with the first models arriving in the UK early in 2025. Combustion Cooper JCW models start from £31,200, while the electric one will be priced from £38,420.

226,Freshly-brewed Mokka: Vauxhall’s crossover updated for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/vauxhall/mokka/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-10-23,Car Magazine UK,"Vauxhall has updated its Mokka crossover, introducing some new bits of tech and tweaked powertrain options. The updated model doesn’t look all that different, which is a good thing to our eyes – Vauxhall’s Mokka marked a start for the brand’s design renaissance and, three years on, it still looks funky and modern. In the images provided, a new teal body colour and wheel design are available. In bigger update news, the interior has had a going over, introducing some more modern technology. Despite being a new-age Stellantis model, the original Mokka was dogged with still using the old, clunky PSA infotainment; that’s now gone in favour of the system first seen in the Astra. That tech is displayed on a 10-inch driver display and separate touchscreen, and includes details like a customisable layout, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and more advanced voice control that uses ChatGPT. . The range has been simplified, too. Vauxhall says that the spec options consist of Design, GS and Ultimate trims with no option packs to muddle the buying process, and you can either choose a mild hybrid petrol engine (badged as Mokka Hybrid) or the Mokka Electric version. The former is the same powertrain seen in other Stellantis products; a 134bhp mild hybrid three-cylinder mated to a new six-speed dual-clutch transmission (hurrah – the old eight-speed auto was so dim-witted), while the EV model claims up to 250 miles on a charge. The new(ish) Mokka is available to order from 6 November 2024. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

227,Xiaomi SU7: Ford CEO Jim Farley's favourite EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/xiaomi/su7/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-10-24,Car Magazine UK,"Ford CEO Jim Farley says that he loves this: the Xiaomi SU7 electric car. In with Robert Llewelyn, the Ford boss said: ‘I don’t like talking about the competition so much, but I drive a Xiaomi. We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago and I’ve been driving it for six months now, and I don’t want to give it up.’ ‘Everyone’s talking about the Apple car…’ Farley adds, ‘but the Xiaomi car! That now exists and it’s fantastic. It’s selling 10,000… 20,000 a month, it’s sold out for six months. That is an industry juggernaut, and a consumer brand that is much stronger than car companies.’ It’s a low-slung sports saloon that’s more than in its execution. The Xiaomi EV launch caused something of a meltdown among electric car fans and the company cites a six-month waiting list, just days after the vehicle was launched in China. It took 88,898 orders in the first 24 hours. Pricing had been announced when the car launched in April 2024 and it is startlingly cheap considering the level of performance on offer: in China the regular car is priced from 219,900 yuan, equivalent to just £24k at current exchange rates, rising to 299,900 yuan for the range-topping Max (or £33k). Unveiled in Shanghai in late 2023, the SU7 (SU being short for Speed Ultra) will spearhead a £8.9 billion push into electric cars for the smartphone maker – and there are big plans ahead. ‘By working hard over the next 15 to 20 years, we will become one of the world’s top five automakers, striving to lift China’s overall automobile industry,’ said Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, speaking at the car’s debut. It’s a bold ambition by the electronics giant, which is rated as the world’s third biggest smartphone manufacturer with a market share of 12%. It is not yet clear when Xiaomi will launch in the UK, but those prices would likely rise considerably if the model were exported here. A cheaper, high-volume EV is a likely long-term goal for Xiaomi (especially given its position in the smartphone market), but right now it needs to focus on brand building – and the SU7 is the product to do it. Xiaomi’s new flagship will be looking to fight with Porsche’s Taycan and the Tesla range of high-performance saloons in both performance and features, with Jun saying the company is looking to build ‘a dream car comparable to Porsche and Tesla.’ On the outside, the SU7 certainly bears a resemblance to its competition from Stuttgart – partly because of the design choices necessary when building a low-drag EV – but it looks to have competitive specs, too. That slippery, teardrop shape contributes to an impressively aerodynamic 0.195Cd drag figure. The SU7 will be available in single- or dual-motor variants, with the top all-wheel drive model getting 475kW of power, equivalent to a heady 664bhp. That’s good for a 0-62mph launch of just 2.78 seconds and top speed of 165mph, according to Xiaomi. Dynamics aside, the top SU7 looks to be competitive on paper, then. Range will vary between 434 and 515 miles, depending on the spec, thanks to battery sizes ranging from 74kWh in the entry model to 101kWh in the Max. Full specs look like this: Xiaomi says the SU7 will have autonomous tech similar in performance to Tesla when it’s released later in 2024. The other big draw for the SU7 will be an operating system shared with its booming mobile device business. In the same way Porsche, Aston Martin and others are now doubling down with Apple on CarPlay integration, Xiaomi can leverage its smartphone tech to foster familiarity with its EV interiors. The Xiaomi SU7’s operating system is integrated with the company’s proprietary HyperOS in its phones and laptops Xiaomi EVs will be manufactured in a state-owned BAIC Group factory in Beijing, with a claimed capacity of 200,000 units a year.

228,Say goodbye to the Morgan Plus Six with the Pinnacle edition,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/morgan/plus-six/,Jake Groves,2024-10-24,Car Magazine UK,"Morgan is signing off the end of production with a new Pinnacle edition. The announcement means a 50-plus year production run is coming to an end. Just 30 of the Pinnacle models will be made, coming complete with a load of bespoke details. And that is the name of the game, here. Morgan says that every car is made to a client’s specifications, and adds that is no different for the Pinnacle model. The one pictured is finished in a fantastically purple hue but is available in literally any colour the client wants. All Pinnacle models feature a slight champagne-like colour to the wheels, too. Morgan also adds that the Pinnacle edition is available with one of three interior colour trims. Fawn, Explore and Riviera – code for light tan pictured, dark brown and green or light blue respectively. Teak is also used inside – a nod to the Midsummer project with Pininfarina – with aluminium inserts in the centre console. Morgan has also given the Pinnacle model its own logo, which is stitched into the seats. Performance is unchanged, with the Plus Six using a BMW-derived 335bhp 3.0-litre straight-six, good for a four-ish-second 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 166mph. Get your order in fast, given the limited production run of just 30. Want one? You’ll need £96,995. And, as the Plus Six retires, Morgan isn’t leaving us all hanging; the brand says an ‘all-new flagship’ will launch in 2025 to replace it.

229,AU only live twice: Goldfinger's Rolls reborn 60 years on,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rolls-royce/goldfinger-phantom/,Colin Overland,2024-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"Back off, Aston Martin – you’re not going to grab all the automotive glory from the 60th anniversary fuss around the third film in the James Bond franchise. Rolls-Royce’s Bespoke team have built a one-off tribute for a Rolls collector and Bond fan. It’s based on a 2024 extended-wheelbase Phantom, so is mechanically different in every way from the 1937 Phantom III Sedanca de Ville used in the 1964 film, but a combination of precision-matched colour and clever details alluding to scenes from the movie makes it a neat counterpoint to Aston Martin’s new limited-edition DB12 Goldfinger Edition, celebrating the DB5’s first appearance in a 007 blockbuster. In the film, Bond drives his Aston on the trail of villain Auric Goldfinger and his henchman Oddjob, smuggling gold that’s built into the Rolls. Scenes that have gone into movie history include a pursuit on the Furka Pass, and an encounter at Stoke Park golf club. Highlights of the unique new Rolls include a map of the Furka Pass on the ‘Gallery’, the piece of dash in front of the passenger, while the LEDs in the roof’s ‘Starlight Headliner’ replicate the constellation above the pass during filming. The umbrellas that are inserted in the doors of modern Phantoms are here in a harlequin pattern, a nod to the villain’s favoured design. There’s a solid gold golf club fitted in the bootlid. The picnic tables for the rear passengers depict a fictional map of the bullion reserve at Fort Knox. The gold-plated VIN plate bears a number ending in 007. And although the car’s aluminium body panels have not been replaced by gold, there are two clever references to gold smuggling.  A block of gold in the shape of the Phantom lurks in the centre console. And the Spirit of Ecstasy emblem on the bonnet has been finished in a way that makes it look as though a silver coating is wearing off to reveal gold beneath. The design team, which began the project three years ago, was led by Nick Rhodes. He told CAR that this project was very different from other special commissions: ‘Most cars that my team deal with are very personal to the client. But so many people can relate to this.’ They had access to the original film car – recently restored – and ‘watched the film multiple, multiple’ times, but the aim was to capture the essence rather than create a replica. ‘The easy thing would be to copy the original car, but there’s nothing inventive in that. It’s got to visually have some reference to the original, and the other aspect is reference to the film itself. Hence all the areas of hidden gold and scenes from the film we’ve incorporated into the car.’ He admits there was potential  for creating something garish. ‘If you threw everything at it, it wouldn’t be very tasteful. But I think we’ve done a good job. That’s the beauty of it – you’re constantly noticing things, the longer you look at it. ‘Things like the Spirit of Ecstasy – you don’t notice at first, but then you look closer and there are small areas of gold. That was a challenge, coming up with this technique to make it appear the gold is hidden. In reality you can’t silver-plate gold, so we had a solid silver Spirit of Ecstasy, gold painted in parts.’ The car will be formally handed over to the UK-based owner at Stoke Park at a private event, but expect it to make some public appearances too. Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
230,The Scout name returns with Traveler SUV and Terra truck,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/scout/4x4/,Jake Groves,2024-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"It’s the International Harvester Scout, but not as we know it. Scout Motors has officially launched, revealing its Traveler SUV and Terra pick-up truck for the North American market. The new, tough off-roaders are both all-electric and designed to fight , as well as EVs available in the North American market like the , and, of course, the . But, as well as electric versions, Scout is launching its new 4x4s with range extender versions. Both the Traveler SUV and Terra pickup share a lot of design elements, with a blocky and beefy aesthetic and plenty of chunky details. The proportions are designed to include short front and rear overhangs for steep inclines and declines, and the Terra pick-up comes with a ‘right-sized’ cargo bed. Inside, all the latest tech is present and correct with big screens and software that can be upgraded over-the-air, but smaller details like the Terra’s option of a bench seat in the front row is a neat touch. There’s some proper nerdy stuff under the skin, too. Both models use an e-motor on each axle and, in EV form, run on an 800-volt architecture, good for 350kW ultra-fast charger speeds. Scout says both electric models will manage 350 miles on a charge and sprint to 60mph in 3.5 seconds. But the brand says it has ‘listened’ to customer concern about EVs, so has included what it calls an ‘Extended Range’ model that features a, er range extender. Scout is calling the powertrain the Harvester, and is designed to increase range from 350 miles to 500 miles. What’s also interesting is that the powertrain and engineering beneath will translate across the Atlantic. Audi designed to battle the and for a few years now, with CAR’s insiders suggesting the resulting car will use the same technology as the Scout models launching here. The Scout models are only available in North America, with the brand saying that buyers can reserve one now.

231,Nextbase Piqo unveiled: the smart dashcam designed for young people,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/nextbase-piqo/,Aaron Hussain,2024-10-28,Car Magazine UK,"Dashcam leaders, Nextbase has unveiled its latest model: the Nextbase Piqo. It’s an all-new, pocket-sized that’s not only filled with clever tech to match its upmarket siblings, but sits a penny below the £100 mark in standard form. The Nextbase Piqo is designed to appeal to younger demographics. The firm carried out a study in 2024 with a group people aged between 17-45 and found that an average of 61% preferred a small dashcam without a screen. It is indeed a tiny little unit, measuring in at a mere 109 x 40 x 32mm. It sits in a new segment for Nextbase as a more affordable alternative to yet despite the fact the Piqo uses only a single button, it integrates a load of features usually found in higher-end models. It has a field of view between 140º and 145º degrees in the 1K and 2K models respectively as well as the ability to operate in temperatures as low as -30ºC and as high as 80ºC. There are two variants of the Nextbase Piqo to choose from. There is the 1K model, which offers a full 2560 x 1080p HD recording resolution that sits at £99.99. Or you can step up to the Piqo Pro 2K, which offers 2560 x 1440p, but costs an extra £30 at £129.99. Both variants have a range of features. This includes voice control, Guardian Mode Lite, which sets parameters on your vehicle’s speed and geofence. Witness Mode Lite, which alerts and sends footage to an emergency contact, should an incident occur. This includes road rage and/or an accident. If you opt for the Nextbase Protect subscription of £2.99 a month on top of your purchase, you can enable the Emergency SOS feature, a three-year warranty as opposed to 12-months, and a bigger cloud storage of 180 days rather than 30. Smart Parking is available in both variants, too. Like other this triggers an automatic recording if your vehicle is knocked. It notifies you of this once you’re within range of your vehicle. You have to activate the feature by pairing it with the firm’s Piqo Pro Install or Quick Connect cable – both are sold separately for an extra £25 each. In case you’re wondering, it doesn’t trigger a recording if onlookers are merely peeking into your vehicle. What’s more, the Piqo and the aptly-named ClickMount it comes with are designed to withstand heavy forces, should you be involved in an accident. They have been crash-tested by Nextbase on track-mounted jigs replicating varying levels of G-forces in a crash.

Abarth says the 600e is ‘designed to allow Abarthists to continue experiencing the thrill of driving, as sportiness evolves through electrification.’ Two versions of the new hot EV crossover have been revealed, with a 237bhp model and a hotter 278bhp Scorpionissima flagship. It is the most powerful Abarth so far (moreso than the , for example), and the new EV will feature a mechanical limited-slip differential and tyres that were ‘jointly developed with the supplier for Formula E’ for maximum grip. As well as the ‘Hypnotic Purple’ paint, the Abarth 600e will feature its own sporty bodykit, bespoke 20-inch wheels and beefier brakes, as well as what looks like a lower ride height when compared to the it’s based on. Abarth says it’s put the 600e to work in testing, thrashing it on ‘the toughest racetracks to maximise the vehicle’s performance and increase its reliability.’ Drive modes include Turismo, Street and Track that incrementally up the available power. Prices start from £36,975 for the regular Abarth 600e with 237bhp; the more exclusive Scorpionissima model with 278bhp will set you back £41,975.

233,Audi A6 e-Tron range stretches down to £62k with new single-motor spec,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/a6-e-tron/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-10-29,Car Magazine UK,"The new Audi A6 e-Tron family is now available with a cheaper, single-motor model. In the lowliest Sport trim, that means the A6 e-Tron Sportback hatch starts at £62,500, or £64,300 for the Avant e-Tron estate. By dropping the second electric motor and shrinking the battery to 83kWh, Audi is able to reduce the RRP. The cheapest A6 e-Tron has a range of at least 361 miles, the car maker vows. Audi’s reshaped product strategy is in full swing. Now, it has two columns of cars – its , while its even-numbered cars have batteries and motors. The new A6 e-Tron is Ingolstadt’s newest member of the latter camp, and it’s gunning for some of the on sale. Audi has tried to make the A6 one of the least difficult electric cars to live with – at least on paper. It has a simply enormous maximum driving range of 435 miles with the bigger battery (thanks to its stunningly efficient aerodynamics), it can charge at up to 270kW and it’s packed with clever driver assistance technology designed to take the strain out of long journeys. Plus, because the new A6 is available as both a Sportback (above) and an Avant, it can rival everything from the to the and even the . Couple that with the broad range of powertrains Audi has planned for the A6 (which includes a lightning-chucking RS6 flagship model) and there should be a configuration to suit any driver’s lifestyle. Audi has a healthy range powertrains in the A6’s pipeline and is still busy releasing different combinations of drivetrain, motors and batteries. The most basic A6 will have a single 362bhp electric motor on the rear end. Audi says that’s enough to shunt both the Sportback and Avant variants from 0–62mph in 5.4 seconds before they run into their speed limiters at 130mph. Above that will be the S6. It’ll have an extra electric motor on the front axle, bringing Quattro four-wheel drive and a generous power increase to 496bhp (or 543bhp if you engage launch control). The extra poke slashes the car’s 0–62mph time down to 3.9 seconds and bumps top speed up to 149mph. Both these powertrains are teamed with a large 100kWh battery pack. Audi says the standard A6 has a maximum claimed driving range of 435 miles, while the S6 can manage just shy of 400 miles. And, because both cars have 800-volt electrical architectures, they can support DC charging speeds of up to 270kW. Find a fast enough charger, and you’ll be able to thrash the A6’s battery from 10 to 80 percent capacity in only 21 minutes. To put that another way, just 10 minutes of rapid charging is enough to recover 197 miles of range. That’s convenient, as is Audi’s decision to include support for Plug & Charge. This clever bit of tech means you don’t even need to wave your payment card at the charging point. You simply link your card to your car, connect the charging cable and wait for the payment to be automatically issued once it’s finished charging. Part of the reason why the A6 has such a long range is its flush aero package. Audi says it’s the slipperiest car it’s ever built – the Sportback has a drag co-efficient of just 0.21, while the Avant has a rating of 0.24. There are only a couple of cars on sale today that can beat the Sportback’s figure, one of which being the super high-tech . Audi will release more powertrains for the A6 over the next couple of years. So far, we know that a new ‘Performance’ variant (which will sit between the standard car and the S6) is on the way. The UK specifications start with the Performance model and then step up to S6. That’ll be followed up by model which will do battle with the likes of the and Lucid Air Dream Edition. The car’s built on Audi’s new Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture. The same kit of components is found under the and the new . It brings some fancy equipment  with it, including a torque vectoring system and adjustable air suspension which can lower the body by 20mm in efficiency mode to help the A6 cut through the air more cleanly and eke more miles from its battery. Like the recently unveiled , it’s a real tech-fest. There’s an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster ahead of the driver and a 14.5-inch infotainment system in the middle of the dash, both mounted under one giant piece of curved glass (a bit like BMW’s system). If you fork out a bit more cash, you can have a separate 10.9-inch touchscreen for the passenger side of the dashboard, which can be used to either entertain the passenger (with video streaming apps, for example) or support the driver (with secondary controls for the sat-nav system). Plus, thanks to a snazzy polarising filter, the front passenger can legally use the screen on the move without distracting the driver. Keep digging through the A6’s options list and you’ll find even more tech, such as an augmented reality head-up display that projects speed, navigation instructions and road sign info onto the windscreen ahead of the driver. There’s also an electrochromic sunroof that can be switched from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. It’s roomy, too. We’ve already been to see the new A6 in the studio and were impressed by the amount of passenger space. Audi has stretched out the A6’s wheelbase and pushed the car’s wheels as close as possible to its corners, which has produced some extra legroom and kneeroom for those in the rear. The seats are also staggered like theatre chairs. Those in the rear sit ever-so slightly higher up than those in the front, which should help to reduce the effects of motion sickness by allowing a clearer view out of the windscreen for all. Headroom is great, too, especially in the Avant which has a 40mm taller roofline. Boot space looks quite disappointing at first – both the Sportback and Avant offer 502 litres. That’s 18 litres less than you get in the BMW 5 Series and only 77 litres more than you get in the which, let’s not forget, belongs to the class below. However, Audi only measures the A6’s boot capacity up to the level of the parcel shelf – and we can confirm there’s more space in both cars than that figure would lead you to believe. Plus, you get an extra 27 litres under the bonnet, which is handy for storing items such as screen wash and charging cables. Audi’s design department seems to really enjoy playing around with lighting technology right now. So, it’s made an illuminated LED badge at the of the car and a range of customisable lighting signatures for the A6’s daytime running lights and taillights. Our favourite one is a setting that makes the rear lights shimmer like a rare jewel by gently igniting and extinguishing the units’ OLED crystals. Audi also tells us that the system is controlled by an algorithm that ensures the lights never display the same pattern twice. In addition, there’s an extra function for the rear lights that’ll display a specific signature to warns any drivers behind to back off if they’re following you too closely. The irony of having this fitted to an Audi wasn’t lost on us, but you can make your own jokes. Obviously, there’s loads of driver assistance tech, too. Standard equipment includes a reversing camera, a traffic-sign based speed limiter, adaptive cruise control and a driver attention monitor. There’s also a semi-autonomous driving mode that combines all these functions to assume control of the car on the motorway (under the driver’s supervision). Audi is also making a big song and dance about how sustainable the A6 is. So, its doors, bonnet and boot lid are made from aluminium, which is very recyclable and lightweight (therefore saving battery power and improving efficiency). There are also loads of recycled materials peppered throughout the A6’s cabin – and it’s the second model to be produced by Audi’s new carbon-neutral assembly methods. At launch in September 2024 prices for the A6 e-Tron Sportback started from £69,900, with the Avant starting from £71,700. Want the S6 versions? You’ll need at least £97,500 for the Sportback, or £99,300 for the Avant. In late October 2024, Audi UK confirmed cheaper entry-level models with single-motor drivetrains and a smaller battery, starting at £62,500.

234,Porsche 911 Carrera T Cabriolet: 'GT3 Lite' spec now available on soft-top for first time,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/911-carrera-t-cabriolet/,Tim Pollard,2024-10-29,Car Magazine UK,"Unravelling Porsche’s 911 family tree has long been a game of . But with the latest 2025 model year revisions, the latest 992.2 family has spawned another derivative: the first-ever Porsche 911 Carrera T Cabriolet. Earlier versions had restricted the more focused, pared-back 911 to coupe bodystyle only, but from next year the GT3-on-a-budget vibe will be open to buyers who prefer their nine-eleven thrills alfresco. It’ll follow the recipe established in the previous generation: a lighter, more driver-oriented format, with 40kg jettisoned in the name of a crash diet. Reduced noise insulation, six-speed manual transmission and full bucket seats brings the in at 1478kg. T stands for ‘Touring’ and it’s inspired by 1968’s zestier 911 T. Today the model is seen as a purists’ special and it sits in the range betwixt the base Carrera and brawnier Carrera S. The new 992.2 911 Carrera T Cabriolet has the 3.0-litre twin-turbo flat six, producing an identical 389bhp and 332lb ft as the coupe. Both models have a six-speed manual with switchable down-blip function and the Sport Chrono option is standard, bringing 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds (coupe) and 4.7sec (cabriolet). Top speed is pegged at 183mph for the tin-top, 1mph up on the soft-top. Tartan seat fabric is standard on the Carrera T, with Sport-Tex upholstery, while the shortened, quick-shift gearlever is topped with open-pore walnut laminated wood. Handling thrills should be ensured by a comprehensive chassis makeover: 10mm lowered PASM sports suspension, rear-axle steering and revised damper and anti-rolls bars at both ends to optimise the T’s dynamics. The last time we drove the 992 Carrera T, we declared it the Goldilocks of the 911 range. Read . Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

235,Skoda Kodiaq vRS revealed as sporty seven-seat SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/kodiaq-vrs/,Ted Welford,2024-10-30,Car Magazine UK,"The new Skoda Kodiaq vRS has been revealed as the brand’s sportiest SUV to date, gaining a power boost and more aggressive styling to go with it. Revealed as the new flagship version of , the Kodiaq vRS has been revealed in what has been an exceptionally busy 12 months for the firm, following new versions of the , regular Kodiaq and the . Here’s everything you need to know about it. That was back in 2018 when the Kodiaq vRS was first launched, but Skoda swapped the big torquey diesel engine for petrol power when the original Kodiaq was facelifted in 2021. The same 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine remains, but has been tweaked to produce 261bhp, 19bhp more than before, while torque has increased from 273 to 295lb ft. The result is a 6.4-second 0-62mph, two-tenths less than before, and a 144mph top speed. It’s fundamentally the same engine as the – and facelifted due imminently – though the Kodiaq instead uses all-wheel-drive, rather than front. All models feature a seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox, too. If you’re looking to drive your seven-seat bus quite enthusiastically, you’ll be glad to know a few other changes have been made to handle the power. Highlights are ventilated brake discs all around, along with two-piston brake callipers at the front. Progressive steering is also included, as is the VW Group’s renowned Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) that lets you adjust the settings to your preferences – most notably the suspension. The 2.0-litre TSI isn’t the most thrilling of engine sounds, so the Kodiaq vRS also comes with a ‘Dynamic Sound Boost’ to liven things up a bit – though mainly just through the speakers. Yes, there are no surprises on the styling front. Imagine a slightly sportier-looking Kodiaq and the vRS is just that, with lots of hints taken from the all-show-but-no-go Sportline model. There are redesigned bumpers, along with the usual vRS full-width deflector across the rear. You’ll also spot some exhaust tips – real, incredibly – and 20-inch alloy wheels with red brake callipers. Black styling accents are aplenty, with a gloss black grille, door mirrors, roof rails and window frames – fans of chrome, look away. Moving inside, the vRS features electric sports seats trimmed in microsuede and artificial leather, along with a sports steering wheel and many red accents throughout – the trademark colour of a vRS. Given any Kodiaq is pretty well-equipped, it’s no surprise that the range-topping vRS model is quite lavishly kitted-out. Standard features include seven seats – it might sound a given but on lesser Kodiaqs you have to pay if you want three rows – as well as Matrix LED headlights and keyless entry. A large 13-inch touchscreen is standard too, as is a large 10-inch digital instrument cluster. Prices for the Kodiaq vRS are likely to start from around £50,000 when sales start in early 2025.

236,"'No higher taxes at the pump this year,' says Chancellor in 2024 Budget speech",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/uk-budget-2024/,Graham King,2024-10-30,Car Magazine UK,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has committed to maintaining fuel duty at its current level for at least the next year. Delivering the Labour Government’s first Budget statement since taking office, Reeves said ‘increasing fuel duty next year would be the wrong choice’ as the cost of living crisis and oil price volatility continues to bite. The 5p cut in fuel duty – which has been in place since 2012 – will remain in place of the next 12 months. On top of that, the planned increase in fuel duty in line with inflation planned for the 2025/2026 financial year has also been nixed. According to the Treasury, the freeze will save drivers £59 per year on the cost of fuel, over the projected cost with the original duty raise. Reeves also announced the Government’s intentions to implement Fuel Finder, which will allow drivers to find the cheapest fuel in their area.  The scheme was recommended to the previous government by the Competition and Markets Authority, after it found evidence of unfair pricing practices in the fuel retail industry. The Treasury believes Fuel Finder will increase competition among fuel stations and could reduce prices by as much as 6p per litre. RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: ‘Drivers will breathe an enormous sigh of relief. It’s good to see the Government firmly recognising the importance of the car to millions of households up and down the country. Eight-in-10 drivers tell us they are dependent on their vehicles for the journeys they need to make. It’s worth remembering that even as of today, 56% of the price of a litre of petrol is already tax in the form of fuel duty, and the VAT that is charged on top.’ But there’s a sting in the tail for new car buyers. CO2 emissions-based first-year VED rates that are paid on brand-new cars are set to change in an effort to encourage more people into EVs, widening the gap between them and combustion-engine cars. For the 2025/2026 financial year, first-year VED will double for cars that emit more than 171g/km from £1095 to £2190. That could hit buyers of fairly prosaic large family cars particularly hard. Performance car enthusiasts, too. Buyers of the most polluting cars will have to stump up nearly £6500. But there are no new active incentives to encourage private buyers into EVs, despite the Government reaffirming its plan to ban the sale of purely combustion-engined cars from 2030. However, the existing company car tax regime that heavily favours EVs will remain in place. Elsewhere in her Budget statement, Chancellor Reeves said an extra £500 million will be spent fixing another 1 million potholes every year. While it’s welcome news, the RAC’s Simon Williams said the money must be spent wisely. ‘It’s vital councils don’t just use the money to fill potholes as this is unlikely to the deliver the long-term benefits drivers so badly want to see. We believe greater use of preventative maintenance is essential.’ Fresh investment in EV infrastructure was also announced. To help facilitate the transition, £200 million was committed to building chargepoints during 2025-2026, with specific funding for local councils to install on-street chargers. The cap on single bus fares has been lifted from £2 to £3 for the 12 months from January 2025, as well. It’ll be welcome news for the bus industry, which has faced steep increases in operating costs over the last couple of years, if not passenger advocacy groups. The editor of CAR’s sister title Parkers, Keith Adams, commented: ‘The freeze in fuel duty is welcome as it’s where we most feel the cost of driving, but the news that government is committing £500m to increased spending on road maintenance and improvements and £200m to accelerate EV charger roll-outs in 2025-26 are also heartening. We’ve been calling for improved street charging, and this answers that question. ‘Maintaining long-term tax incentives to purchase electric cars through low first-year VED rates is also welcome, as are the continued supporting of EV-friendly Company Car Tax rates, but I’d dearly love to see some help given to private buyers of new electric cars by the reintroduction of the grants that were phased out in 2023.’ Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"
237,Hyundai Intium concept: hydrogen FCEV is a retro (and much better looking) Pontiac Aztek,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/intium/,Jake Groves,2024-10-31,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Intium – a hydrogen fuel cell concept car from Hyundai. This bold, retro-looking SUV is a preview to a future FCEV from the brand, which will succeed in 2025. As well as sending a message that Hyundai is still pushing hydrogen fuel cell development, the Intium is the first car to debut Hyundai’s ‘art of steel’ design language. As you can tell, it still looks fantastically retro-futuristic, in keeping with models like the and . There are lots of boxy details, like bold DRLs and a set of four dots on the ‘grille’ arrangement at the front. Did you know that the four dots used by Hyundai are actually Morse code for the letter ‘H’? The rear end looks a lot like the Pontiac Aztek, too. But, in this case, that’s not an insult; Hyundai has shaped the rear with a tall hatchback design and steeply angled rear window to keep that boxy shape going. Aerodynamic 18-inch wheels are designed to help keep driving range up, while camera mirrors and a bulky roof rack complete the package. Even with the bold design, though, the focus is what’s underneath. Hyundai says it has a pair of hydrogen fuel tanks, battery pack and an electric motor developing 201bhp. The brand is also targeting a driving range of around 400 miles, which would make the resulting production car from the Intium concept on par with its NEXO predecessor in terms of range. As with electric cars, Hyundai says it has developed navigation that can calculate the optimum route based on the (borderline imaginary) hydrogen filling station infrastructure. And, given this is a chunky SUV designed for the family, neat details like vehicle-to-load technology and a second row with ‘a large reclining angle for increased comfort’ feature. We’ll see a production model spun out of the Hyundai Intium concept in 2025. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

238,Braving the elements: Renault’s Emblème concept and a mission to decarbonise,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/embleme/,Seth Walton,2024-10-31,Car Magazine UK,"Renault’s EV specialist division Ampere has outlined a strategy to significantly decarbonise Renault Group vehicles, manifested in the Renault Emblème concept car. Ampere, Renault’s technology-driven sub brand spearheading the development and production of Renault’s EV programme, is taking a holistic approach to decarbonisation, considering a car’s emissions across its entire lifespan, or ‘from the cradle to the grave.’ Ampere says this can be split into five phases: ‘eco-design’, the source of materials used in the manufacturing of vehicles, the manufacturing process itself, the car’s use and then its end-of-life care. According to the marque, the Emblème is product of this tac. Ampere says the car would emit 90% less carbon across its lifespan compared to a comparable fossil fuel-powered car built today. ‘Emblème embodies our ecosystem approach and the level of our ambition when it comes to building a sustainable future through technological innovation,’ says Luca De Meo, Renault Group and Ampere CEO ‘It embodies the future Design Language of the Renault brand. An average ICE car has a 50 tons footprint: for Emblème, it’s 5 tons, cradle to grave. It’s a masterpiece.’ Let’s start with the materials. Since almost all of the carbon produced by material extraction comes from just a handful of primary culprits – chiefly steel, aluminium and  polymers –  Ampere has drawn on the expertise of an eclectic partner pool to optimise its selection of raw materials and lower its carbon footprint at purchasing. The Emblème is built from low-carbon steel, low-carbaluminium and plastics to reduce its carbon footprint, while the battery comprises of sustainably extracted nickel and sulphate, among other materials. As for power train, the Emblème utilises a dual energy system for its 160kw electric motor, drawing power from a 40 kWh battery as well as a hydrogen fuel cell. Ampere is investing – and banking – heavily on the future of hydrogen fuel, though as an axillary power supply to work in tandem with a conventional battery. On shorter journeys, the Emblème would carry out its duties like any other EV, but with a longer journey ahead, could rely on the longevity of hydrogen power to fuel the car while avoiding any long charging periods. According to Ampere, the Emblème should be able to cover over 620 miles in the same time period as an ICE-powered car, with only two five minute stops required to refuel to hydrogen cell. Where would you get the hydrogen fuel from? Well, Ampere reckons that the adoption of hydrogen fuel use in trucks will eventually necessitate the development of at least some refuelling structure, even if it only exists on the motorway. Whether that transpires, remains to be seen. Yes, by increasing the efficiency of its batteries, Ampere has been able to reduce their size without compromising too much on output. As a result of the downsize, though, the batteries are also considerably lighter. A conventional 87kWh battery might weigh as much as 513 kilograms, but the 40 kWh battery in the Emblème weighs only 291 kilos, contributing to an overall vehicle weight of just 1,800 kilograms for a further reduction in carbon emissions. Finally the end of life care. Ampere says the Embleme has been crafted so that almost the entire car can be recycled at the end of its lifespan. Many of the body’s fundamental materials, including the steel, aluminium and plastics, are fully recyclable. It’s unlikely that the Emblème will go into production – though nothing should be entirely discounted – but Ampere has put together a schedule of when certain technologies may start to be mass produced. For example, by 2026 the marque wants to lower battery costs by 20% through a transition to Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC). Historically LFP haven’t had the energy density to be be used viably, but owing to a rebalance of the chemistry, including a switch from graphite to silicon anodes (getting techy now), LFP batteries can be just as energy dense as MNC yet still remain cheap and safe as. By 2028, Ampere wants to go completely cobalt free, which it expects to create a 50% reduction in battery costs compared to today. By 2026, Ampere also has plans to launch the first ever software-defined vehicle – a car that features a centralised computer architecture, capable of receiving over the air updates so the vehicle can evolve over its lifetime. If an SDF sounds like a smartphone on wheels, it pretty much is, and it’s telling that of Ampere’s 11,000 employees, 35% are engineers while 50% are software developers. According to Renault’s vision of the future, software will become the fundamental essence of a car’s makeup.

239,Jaguar to stop selling all new cars in the UK this month,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/jaguar/f-pace-production-ends/,Ted Welford,2024-11-01,Car Magazine UK,"Jaguar will end all new UK sales in November meaning no new cars will be available from the firm until its . The , I-Pace and E-Pace are Jaguar’s last surviving cars in the UK after the British firm stopped production of its other models earlier in the year. This included the and , as well as the . UK-bound production of the and , both produced externally in Graz, Austria, by Magna Steyr, also came to an end in the summer, though global production of the two cars continues until December 2024. While the F-Pace SUV remains in production for overseas markets until early 2025, the firm will stop selling new examples in the UK from mid-November. It will mean no new Jaguars can be bought until at least 2026. In a statement, Jaguar said: ‘From November 2024, new Jaguar sales will come to an end ahead of our new brand reveal later this year and product launch in 2026. While we have now ceased allocation of our current generation of Jaguar vehicles, we do have a selection of models available to acquire on an Approved Pre-Owned basis through our UK retail network.’ New and pre-registered examples of its full line-up of models, including the XE and XF discontinued in the summer, have remained available on the Jaguar website. But all new Jaguars in the UK will need to be registered by the middle of the month and after that, the firm’s dealers will only be selling used cars until 2026. Jaguar introduced the F-Pace in 2016 as its first SUV, and it’s remained the brand’s best-selling model ever since. A significant facelift in 2021 introduced an on-trend plug-in hybrid model, while the sporty V8-powered was often regarded as one of the best performance SUVs. Even last year, the F-Pace outsold all of Jaguar’s other cars combined, though the brand’s sales have long stood in the shadow of its sibling brand Land Rover. Jaguar announced back in 2021 that it would become an electric-only firm by 2025, and while other manufacturers have pushed back their EV plans in the wake of slowing demand, to the British firm’s credit it has stuck with its decision. Jaguar’s first new-era model is an electric four-door GT car that is set to resemble a significant deviation from its current portfolio. A concept model previewing its new design language and ‘new brand reveal’ is due imminently, ahead of expected sales starting in 2026. From there, a line-up of new electric models will follow, including a large SUV and high-end saloon. Jaguar has already said it will no longer work to chase volume and instead focus on high-end, high-margin products. Production of the XE, XF and F-Type took place in Castle Bromwich, while the F-Pace is manufactured alongside various Range Rovers in Solihull, both in the West Midlands. This latter plant is expected to become the home for Jaguar’s new electric models, while a £4bn EV battery manufacturing facility has been confirmed in Bridgewater, Somerset, which Jaguar Land Rover’s owners Tata says will open in 2026.

240,Does Elon Musk love Trump more than the planet?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/elon-musk-trump-2024-us-election/,Ben Oliver,2024-11-01,Car Magazine UK,"Elon Musk has endorsed Donald Trump in the US election. He’s attended Trump rallies and, at an event on 20 October 2024 in Pittsburgh, has said ‘there’s a potential for us to have an amazing, exciting future but we just have to work hard to make that happen. Electing President Trump is essential to making that happen.’ So, is the EV enthusiast-in-chief jeopardising both Tesla sales and his plan to turn us into ‘a sustainable energy civilisation’ by backing a candidate who thinks we should make that transition sometime in the next ‘500 to 1000 years’, and would end America’s ‘EV mandate’ on day one of his new administration? Who knows. Trying to figure out the thought processes and true intentions of America’s most bizarre and erratic public figure is hard enough: when the top two form an odd alliance it’s almost impossible to know what’s really going on. You can decide for yourself which is number one. This may simply be Musk being typically contrary. He has little love for the Biden-Harris administration, having been conspicuously uninvited to a White House EV summit, and made the subject of federal investigations into the range and ‘full self-driving’ capabilities of his cars, and labour relations at his US factories. It may also have little to do with cars at all. Despite once describing himself as a ‘moderate Democrat’ and vowing to stay out of politics, Musk’s public stance on immigration and gender issues is now far to the right, and he has been accused of disseminating pro-Trump election misinformation and failing to prevent Russian attempts to influence the election on X. But there’s probably also some slightly counter-intuitive self-interest at work here. Although there is no ‘EV mandate’ in the US, Biden did introduce the Inflation Reduction Act, a vast and transformative piece of legislation with bipartisan support. Among many other provisions it reset the incentives for electric car purchases in the US, with the aim of increasing adoption but also encouraging US manufacturing and reducing imports of Chinese cars, parts and battery minerals. There were also incentives to improve and grow America’s public charging network. Elon isn’t a believer in state subsidies, and in the fully-electric future which he envisaged as recently as 2023, in , such subsidies would fade away anyway. Ending them now, while Tesla enjoys a huge lead in both electric-car manufacturing and public charging as its rivals ramp up and absorb huge losses, would solidify its advantage. Joe Biden has already imposed a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese-made EVs, which Harris won’t reverse, but Trump is likely to go much further, with tariffs of up to 60 per cent on all Chinese goods and possibly up to 20 per cent on all imports, from anywhere. With Tesla factories already well-established in China and Europe, the trade war that Trump’s nativism and protectionism is likely to spark with both will only benefit Elon. Musk drew the most ire for citing ‘headaches and nausea’ as the main threats from increased carbon dioxide levels, rather than droughts, rising sea levels and other disasters for the planet, and for his relaxed view of the speed with which we should transition to sustainable energy. His views on the hydrocarbon industry didn’t differ much from previous pronouncements but had clearly been softened to appeal to a Trump audience. ‘If we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,’ he said. ‘We do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.’ In return, Trump is moderating his views on electric vehicles, having once described them as ‘lunacy’ and saying their supporters should ‘rot in hell’: though his backtracking somehow managed to make Musk look like a model of tact and diplomacy. ‘I’m for electric cars,’ he said at a recent rally. ‘I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly. I have no choice.’ But perhaps this is all a giant nothingburger anyway. Elon Musk is not Taylor Swift. His endorsement of Trump is unlikely to have anything like the impact of her open support for Kamala Harris, though his campaign contributions might. His commitment to saving the planet might have receded sufficiently for him to downplay it in return for some short-term, tactical political gains should Trump win, but I wouldn’t expect to see a V8 Cybertruck any time soon.

241,Modena MA-01: the half-a-million euro Biturbo,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/modena-automobili/project-ma-01/,Keith Adams,2024-11-05,Car Magazine UK,"You might be forgiven for thinking that 2024’s on-trend automotive evolution is the electric SUV or quad-motor EV hypercar or somesuch, but to guarantee the best column inches, the restomod is where it’s at. From Lancia to Lamborghini, via Porsche, we’ve seen them all. Or have we, because here’s another, and it’s an interesting choice. Yes, established in 2022 to build restomods, Modena Automobili is branching out into upgrading classic Maseratis. It’s no surprise that the firm is giving a supercar from that back catalogue the treatment given its Founder Franco Righi and co-founder Luca Stefani are both car-loving industriasts from the area. We wouldn’t have expected them to go with the visually-challenged Shamal, originally built between 1990 and 1996 – instead of something in a more classic in style such as the Bora, Khamsin or (original) Ghibli. The Shamal was one of the final cars produced by Maserati before its takeover by the Fiat Group in 1993, and despite being fast and dramatic looking, it was saddled by its ageing Biturbo-based underpinnings, and a general lack of development budget. In the end, just 369 were made and stood as a testament to how far the Biturbo could be developed. Project MA-01 was kicked off in 2022, after the firm’s co-founders spotted the opportunity to create its own take on the burgeoning trend for restomods by, ‘reimagining an iconic masterpiece of the 1990s into a unique, modern, beautiful, muscular and fast car of our times.’ That’s what they say, anyway. The team behind the car are serious. It’s based on a Biturbo (like the original), using an original donor car’s monocoque, which has been stripped to its constituent components and re-engined with a Maserati Ghibli S power unit, tuned to deliver 500bhp. In addition. It also receives that car’s eight-speed ZF transmission. Interestingly, Modena claims it’ll turn 0-62mph in 5.0 seconds and a maximum speed of 180mph, which is impressive – and we can assume right now, an educated guess. The designers responsible for this re-imagining of the Shamal are Paolo Ferrari and Antonio Bonatti, both talented 3D modellers working for BNC Design. They’ve already created some very tasty-looking modern takes of the Lancia Fulvia and Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale, but if Modena gets the MA-01 off the ground, then this will be their first car to transition into the roadgoing reality. It stays reasonably faithful to the original, although things do start to go awry at the rear. The redesigned front-end gets a set of must-have LED headlights surrounded in carbonfibre, while enlarged air intakes and an aggressive front spoiler give it even more purposfulness than the original. Additional ducts in the bonnet and wheelarch blisters complete the look. At the back, you get modest flying buttresses that meld into a bootlid spoiler that takes you straight back to the 1990s. The rear lights are slimmer than the original, which is a shame, as that was probably the best looking aspect of the car. Project MA-01 also looks to have some interesting underbody aerodynamics – or it might just be a ruse to add even more visual clutter between the quad exhausts. There’s a countdown on , which points at a spring 2025 launch. Although the firm has issued several CGIs of the car, we’ve yet to see it in the metal, and are looking forward to that. The Shamal is an interesting car, and one that stands apart from the more obvious restomod fodder we’ve seen of late. We hear that it’s going to cost €585,000 (£490,500), which put it in the same ballpark as the glorious Kimera 037 (£414,000) and Singer 911 Turbo (£500,000), but more expensive than the Lancia Delta Integrale Futurista (£300,000).

242,Toyota GR86 Rally Legacy Concept channels its inner Celica GT-Four DNA,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/toyota-gr86-rally-legacy-concept/,Tim Pollard,2024-11-06,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has sent its wonderfully old-school sports car off to rally school – and come up with this at the 2024 SEMA tuning show: the Toyota GR86 Rally Legacy Concept. If it looks familiar to car enthusiasts of a certain age, that’s because it’s directly inspired by the 1990s Celica GT-Four rally hotshot, all the way down to the addition of an extra driven axle to make it a WRC wannabe all-wheel drive. Yes, this GR86 Rally Legacy Concept drops its rear-wheel drive hardware for a transplant from the . This is a concept car, so we’ll suspend disbelief for a moment. But the GR86, a resolutely rear-wheel drive driftmobile, has been hacked about to accept the drivetrain from little brother the GR Corolla, an all-wheel drive hot hatch not available in Europe. Bespoke fabricators had to adapt the engine bay significantly to take the Corolla’s taller, transverse-mounted G16E-GTS engine and GR-Four AWD drivetrain, deploying a custom subframe and engine mounts to gain the clearance required. ‘The aim is to evoke memories of the legendary rally car that enthusiasts have admired on rally stages and in popular racing video games,’ said Paul Doleshal, general manager of Motorsports and Assets at Toyota Motor North America. ‘That idea led to a formative conversation about how cool it would be to create a modern interpretation of such an iconic car.’ Sounds like it. The three-cylinder turbo engine gets a race ECU and tuned intercooler and oil cooler to cope with off-road endeavours. Peak power stands at 300bhp while torque is a punchy 273lb ft. The white, red and green colour scheme is a blast from the past for anyone interested in Toyota’s motorsport history – and the brace of driving lights, bewinged rear spoiler and red rally mudflaps complete the vintage rally look.

243,How to win in the car industry in the next ten years: get a crystal ball,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/nissan/ivan-espinosa/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-11-06,Car Magazine UK,"‘Being a product planner today is probably the most difficult job in the company,’ Ivan Espinosa, chief planning officer for Nissan tells me on the final day of the Formula E championship. He’s half joking, but there’s some truth in what he says; drivers Oliver Rowland and Sacha Fenestraz will navigate around the tight and twisty London circuit for the next hour or so, but Espinosa must chart Nissan’s course through the most volatile, disruptive period the automotive industry has ever seen. ‘It used to be very easy, because we only had to take care of our customer base, trends and the technology roadmap,’ he tells us in Nissan’s VIP area high above the track. ‘Today you have all that plus your politics, very stringent regulatory conditions, duties, taxation and a bunch of other things that normally we wouldn’t be taking care of.’ For decades, those in the job enjoyed what now look like relatively calm seas, with incrementally improved combustion technology, predictable emissions laws and a more stable geopolitical backdrop. Now all three are erratic, fast-moving targets: there’s a battery technology breakthrough seemingly every six months, governments U-turn on emissions laws on a whim, and the news is filled with conflict every day. Take the UK, for example. Here, the but there’s talk of Keir Starmer’s new government moving it back. And consumer demand for electric cars isn’t anywhere near what was originally pitched to boardrooms: demand for electric company cars grew by 42 per cent in January of this year, but private demand suffered a 25 per cent slump in the same period. Car makers have spent millions on EV factories and R&D, only to find that there’s a fresh appetite for combustion cars, Conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine have added to anxiety in the financial markets, and we’re perpetually circling an economic meltdown. Put it all together and you have the discombobulating 4D chess board that Espinosa and his counterparts must play on. Product planners need to think several moves ahead – but right now it’s hard to see past the next six months. Recent developments have prompted different responses from different manufacturers. At Audi, the replacement for the A5 uses combustion powertrains – a bold move from a company that two years ago announced its plans to become an electric-only car manufacturer by 2029. Audi is also considering , threatening the Q8 e-Tron that’s built there – as well as the circa-3000 highly-skilled employees. Mercedes and Toyota are back to developing combustion engines after previously signalling a turn towards electrification in its various forms. Mercedes has also dropped the electric EQC from UK showrooms. This is all food for thought for Jaguar, which recently announced a fresh, EV-only strategy. Turning back isn’t an option; Jaguar boss Rawdon Glover told us. ‘It’s not a short-term decision that you can flex midstream. Any platform decision is probably a 12- to 15-year decision. Because you’ve got five, six years in the gestation and then you’ve got probably a maximum of eight, nine years to leverage the platform once you launch it.’ Jaguar, like Nissan, has been heavily involved in Formula E. But whereas , Nissan is being more cautious on its path to, ultimately, an all-electric future. ‘We’re taking a balanced approach because the speed at which the market is electrifying is varying depending on the region,’ says Espinosa. ‘But of course, the final goal is electrification.’ It’s hard to plan several moves ahead, but Espinosa at least has a good mix of chess pieces at his disposal; Nissan will launch 30 new cars globally between now and 2026 with many of them coming to Europe. ‘A lot of those products will be showcasing key technologies like our e-4orce [electric all-wheel drive] systems, and showing next-generation battery technology,’ he tells us. ‘We will also use our e-Power [range extender] technology to keep pushing electrification not only in BEV, but also to get people closer to an electrified experience.’ Amid all these political, economic and technological developments, Espinosa’s team are constantly putting their ears to the ground to focus on the most important factor of all, the consumer. ‘We do a lot of research,’ he tells us. ‘We’re monitoring all of this and being very close to our consumer, because in the end the product and the speed will be decided by the consumer – even if some of our regulations and government movements are pushing through certain things. In the end, the final choice is made by the customer.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

Following in the footsteps of the as the division’s standalone SUV, AMG has now announced it is developing an SUV ‘entirely in-house’. Codenamed ‘Born in Affalterbach’ – yes, really – AMG has only shown off a shadowed silhouette of the model so far, which gives away little information other than the SUV’s generous proportions and slight coupe-like rear end. The new SUV will arrive as AMG’s second electric model, following a that will rival the Porsche Taycan, and be produced around the performance arm’s bespoke ‘AMG.EA’ electric car platform. Rivals will include the and upcoming . AMG has been turning its attention to SUVs for more than 25 years, with its first being the 1998 Mercedes ML55 AMG. Today it offers seven high-riding models wearing AMG badges, from the compact GLA to the well-known . Speaking to CAR Magazine earlier in the year, Michael Schiebe, chairman of Mercedes-AMG, said that an electric AMG must not ‘quickly run out of steam’ – a reference to other EVs that cannot maintain their performance. He also added that they must be able to charge as quickly as possible ‘to get back on the racetrack’. Both of these attributes will be enabled by the use axial flux electric motors, supplied by Yasa, which are designed to bring a 30 per cent increase in torque, a five per cent increase in efficiency and double the performance of a more conventional permanently synchronous motor. While it’s the first SUV developed by AMG. the performance arm has created five bespoke models to date, including both generations of the as well as the . Michael Schiebe added: “SUVs have been among our most popular models for many years. With the ‘Born in Affalterbach’ SUV, we are responding to this trend by offering our customers a truly captivating high-performance off-roader based on the AMG.EA platform. “Our new high-performance architecture follows a clear philosophy: ‘AMG First, EV Second’. This means that the vehicles not only excel as electric vehicles but also embody the core AMG qualities of emotion and performance.” The first development vehicles of the new AMG SUV are set to undergo their first winter testing shortly, with production models unlikely to launch until 2026.

245,"Audi sets up new brand in China, also called AUDI",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/audi-sets-up-new-chinese-car-brand/,Ted Welford,2024-11-07,Car Magazine UK,"is launching a new brand in China and is calling it AUDI. Yes, you read that correctly. Announced in Shanghai today, Audi is establishing a new joint venture with SAIC that aims to bring new premium to Chinese customers, who are generally younger and more tech-savvy than customers in the rest of the world, it says. The confirmation came as Audi revealed the ‘AUDI E concept’ – how on earth did they come up with such a complex name, I know – as a stylish electric GT car. The difference between an Audi and an AUDI being the caps lock and the fact you won’t see the brand’s signature four-rings emblem appearing anywhere. The new concept was developed in both Germany and China, and previews three new electric cars set to launch from mid-2025. According to AUDI’s statement, Audi brings ‘know-how in premium products, design, development and engineering’ while SAIC brings its ‘speed-to-market, local insight and an established technology ecosystem’ that’s needed to succeed in the country. Audi chief executive Gernot Döllner said: “The joint platform will be the basis for a new generation of state-of-the-art intelligent connected vehicles exclusive to China. The upcoming models are aimed at a promising and simultaneously demanding new customer segment. “The cooperation will further expand the Audi portfolio of battery electric vehicles (BEV) in China and accelerate the company’s transformation in the world’s largest market.” The first three electric cars will be in the mid and full-size segment, with SAIC’s help reducing the time it takes to bring a car to market by 30 per cent, the firm says. An is also in the pipeline. The striking AUDI E Concept is a low-slung hatchback-cross-estate with a rather different design to everything Audi currently sells. Labelled as a ‘Sportback’, it packs two electric motors producing 764bhp and 590lb ft of torque, enabling a 3.6-second 0-62mph time. A large 100kWh battery also boasts a claimed 435-mile range on China’s CLTC testing cycle. Audi has tailored all aspects of its AUDI for Chinese customers, including a more minimalist design than its German products, as well as more advanced driver assistance features that customers demand. Audis, as well as AUDIs, are likely to be sold alongside each other in China, though the firm is yet to give specifics as to how the partnership will work next to its existing products.

246,California Dreamin’: new 2025 VW California goes on UK sale priced from £63k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/california/,Seth Walton,2024-11-08,Car Magazine UK,"The new 2025 campervan, now available as a plug-in hybrid and with all-wheel drive, has gone on UK sale, with prices starting from £63,376 for the lowliest Beach spec. Brits can choose from entry-level Beach, Coast and Ocean trim levels – badges that give a hint at the laser-targeted lifestyle audience for this poshest and most enduring of campers. We expect the new one will soon be a popular sight in the more affluent corners of Devon and Cornwall… As teased with last year’s concept model, you can now spec your VW California with a 243bhp hybrid electric power unit, but there’s plenty more to discuss here than just the engine. The new California has been comprehensively redesigned, according to Volkswagen, as it’s shifted onto VW’s MQB platform. Not only that, but the interior has been overhauled and new recreational features have been introduced as part of the package. Oh, and there’s now a sliding door on both sides of the vehicle. Read for everything you need to know about the new 2025 Volkswagen California. Better access, obviously. This will likely be of particular interest to UK buyers, as all previous Californias have their sliding door on the right only. This isn’t ideal for letting people out safely as you’ll usually find out pavements on the left. According to Lars Krause from the Commercial Vehicles Sales and Marketing team, adding an extra sliding door was a priority for the convenience and safety of VW’s UK and New Zealand-based customers – it was from that idea that the new ‘three living spaces’ design concept was conceived, with awnings or tents on either side. As ever, there’s a flat floor throughout as well, so moving between the front and rear seats – also known as the lounge and kitchen area – remains easy. In fact, it’s now even better, as the Multivan uses an electronic handbrake instead of the trouser-grabbing lever. Roughly where it’s always been, on the left side of the cabin. Except now that there’s a door on that side VW’s had to be even cleverer about its design. So instead of a fixed amount of kitchen real estate, the California features a slide-out work surface that integrates an induction hob, gas hob and sink. Below this you’ll find storage, including drawers that can be accessed inside and outside the vehicle, and a similarly versatile fridge. The change here means you can access the cooking and cold storage facilities from outside of the van as well. To encourage this kind of alfresco adventurousness, Volkswagen has also integrated a portable electric grill into the concept and fitted the main awning on this side. You can still enjoy some protection from the elements on the right, however, as the new California comes with a sun sail on that side. It’s like a complete mobile camp site or something, especially as VW has still found room for the traditional outdoor table (this doubles as the indoor table and stores under the lower bed) and chairs that store in the tailgate. These have higher backrests than before for extra comfort. When the T7 California reaches production, buyers will be able to chose which side they want the full awning attached, or even have one on both. As with previous Californias there’s a pop-up roof, shelled here in aluminium and featuring more panoramic windows than previously considered. Up top you’ll find a sprung bed base, LED lighting and USB-C sockets. Very civilised. Downstairs a second bed can be created using the rear seat backs and a mattress. For the first time, these rear seats are also individual chairs, making them easier to remove than the old – heavy – bench. They also enhance practicality in other ways, as you could just take out just one or install them in parallel so you can slide in a mountain bike or something. In addition to the obvious cupboards there’s storage in the base of these and the front seats, which swivel to face the rear in order to create more of a lounge when you’re parked. And before you ask about something else that sounds a bit like ‘sitting’, there’s no bathroom aboard this new California. You’ll still need the for that. But because the Multivan base vehicle is longer than the Transporter, VW reckons you could get a composting toilet in behind the front seats. If you really wanted to. There is an outdoor shower, though, should you fancy that. No. The team behind the new California explained to us that the idea was considered but wasn’t pursued as doing so could compromise the usability of the car. ‘During conceptual development we always said it would be better to separate the two electric systems,’ Krause told CAR. ‘It’s a matter of the durability of the vehicle and it being ready to use. When you get to your campsite, the electric systems for all camper functions will be ready. No compromises on that, it needs to be useable at all times.’ This means campsites with proper electricity hook-ups will still be favoured. But if this isn’t available you’ll still be able to use the gas hob to heat your beans. VW is hoping to bring this degree of practicality to production, but it will come at a cost. We’d initially suspected not as far as a regular Multivan’s circa 30 miles, due to the additional weight of the camper conversion. However, speaking to VW at the reveal event it confirms the same range electric-only range is expected from the California, as the extra weight of the conversion is offset by the reduced number of passenger seats. Either way, Volkswagen is probably right in pointing out that the new California represents a useful halfway house between the previous diesel-only Californias and the all-electric that’s also due in the next couple of years. We expect customers will have variable thoughts about the turbo-petrol engine that exists alongside the electric components in the T7 California. Literally an iPad. It’s mounted on an extendable arm and running the new control software for the California’s camping functions – including the powered roof. It’s an evolution of the system already offered in the Grand California and folds into the wall just above the sink area. The new California can also be controlled via your smartphone. There’s a backup set of controls in the infotainment system as well. No exact date yet, but VW is promising it will be available to buy in 2024. Which is when Ford is saying the next-generation Nugget will be available with it’s own plug-in hybrid powertrain. Volkswagen UK announced prices for the new California family in November 2024 and each spec starts from: It’s a premium product, alright… Krause told us that VW is working on an all-electric California concept, though based on the ID. Buzz rather than the Multivan chassis. However, he admitted that an all-electric campervan like the California is a concept rife with flaws and issues. ‘I think that there are lots of compromises,’ Krause said. ‘One is range, the second compromise is on weight as batteries are heavy and the third compromise is on speed.’ Pointing to the scintillating Ocean spec California under the spotlights, he explained that the ICE power units on offer in the new California range are where VW’s current customer demands lie. ‘I think there could be a demand (for an electric California), but at this current stage, it’s very small.’ Good question. As mentioned above, the Volkswagen California has been a van underneath its posh skin up until the outgoing generation, and the switch to the Multivan is a promising one on several fronts. The decision to switch to using the Multivan, and therefore VW’s MQB platform, is not just to make the California a little posher and nicer to drive, though. While we don’t know loads about the next generation of VW Transporter just yet, we do know that it is also facing a fundamental shift of its own. It will no longer be a pure VW product, as it is the latest vehicle to be developed courtesy of the partnership with Ford, dubbed Project Cyclone. This agreement will see Ford and VW collaborate on several crucial commercial vehicle projects, some of which are already on sale – the new Ford Ranger and Volkswagen Amarok pickups are both fundamentally the same trucks underneath. The Ford Transit Custom and Volkswagen Transporter are to be the next vehicles to come out of this partnership, with both due on sale in 2024. Ford is set to be the lead partner in this particular project, as it was with the Ranger. With the pickups, this meant that many of the major components – the engines, gearboxes and infotainment setup – are all Ford’s. Volkswagen was able to make changes to configurations and the external design, but it is very much the second partner. So while VW hasn’t officially announced details of the next Transporter, Ford has told us plenty about the new . This means we can make an educated guess at what the Transporter will be like. In short, it’ll come with some or all of Ford’s 108bhp, 134bhp, 148bhp and 168bhp 2.0-litre diesel engines, an electric version and possibly a plug-in hybrid. It’ll have some clever touches like a flat cabin floor, and potentially a staggered bulkhead to make the most of the loading bay. This means that the VW Commercial Vehicle range will take on a slightly odd appearance. The small VW Caddy is of its own creation and based on the MQB platform. The Ford Transit Connect will be a rebadged version of this vehicle. The innovative and all-electric ID. Buzz Cargo is based on VW’s EV-only MEB platform, and there is no Ford version of this. The Amarok is a Ford Ranger underneath, while the large VW Crafter is a purpose-built VW platform. In short, the five VW vans and pickups share little with one another, which is a real rarity in this day and age.

247,Inside Audi Hungaria: the world’s biggest engine factory,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/hungary-factory/,Jake Groves,2024-11-11,Car Magazine UK,"Audi’s factory in Gyor, Hungary is the largest engine factory in the world. The plant is crucial to the brand and the VW Group – one that has, since 1993, produced more than 45 million engines and counting. It’s built everything from dinky three-cylinders to beefy diesel V6s, warbling five-cylinders and the Audi R8’s screaming V10. Audi Hungaria (as it’s known) has also assembled all sorts of Audi models like the from 1998, the and the , and it manufactures body parts that go into Audi Sport models, Lamborghinis and Bentleys. More recently, it’s become the manufacturing home for the new . The plant is so large that it has become one of Hungary’s biggest employers and is its largest exporter. More recently, though, the Gyor plant has found itself right at the centre of Audi’s and the VW Group’s shift towards electrification. ‘After the production of combustion engines, in recent years we have embarked on the path of e-transformation,’ Peter Will, member of the board for powertrain production at Audi Hungaria, tells CAR. ‘Our goal is to be a part of and a strong player in the transformation of Audi.’ The Gyor plant employs around 12,000 people. Around 5300 of those employees are in powertrain production, with around 2000 having retrained from manufacturing combustion engines to building e-motors. As well as building around 9440 combustion engines a day, Gyor produces 2550 electric motors per day – namely for Audi’s PPE platform cars like the and , as well as the . It’s here we learn just how complicated building an e-motor is; the production process is arguably quite similar (and as complex) as manufacturing a combustion engine. In a permanent magnet electric motor used in the Q6 e-Tron, there are 226 ‘hairpins’ in the stator and 216 welding points. While e-motors are designed to use far fewer components than combustion engines, the myth that an electric car has ‘just one moving part’ is just that – a myth. The e-motor plant works a lot like an engine factory does; units come down a line with each part being added one at a time in supremely efficient harmony, with each motor being tested for noise and vibration before it’s ever sent towards a car in the process of being built. But, sometimes, human intervention is needed. A training centre features in the factory, designed to get employees up to speed on the parts that require them to be hands-on. We are guided through some of the process by the training team, led by Zoltán Erdödi – a ‘try-out’ engineer who works with employees on pre-series production projects to get them up to speed building new models or engines. We’re instructed to help install an oil pump and reservoir system into an electric motor for the Q6 e-Tron, including bolting in and sealing the unit. But you can rest easy – it’s just a training mule, and this electric motor won’t end up in a production car. I’m not sure I’d enjoy the impending lawsuit if it ever fell apart. Back in the real world, though, that brand transformation and Group-wide shift has come with pitfalls, industrial lag and slumping consumer demand. So much so that it’s threatening Audi’s manufacturing structure in Europe. Its Brussels site that manufactures batteries and the Q8 e-Tron, for example, will as demand dries up and buyout offers from other companies haven’t materialised in the way Audi has wanted. Volkswagen, too, is . Plus, only a week after we had visited the Gyor facility, Audi published its Q3 2024 results on 5 November. They’re not pretty, with large drops in operating profit and reductions in deliveries in Europe, the USA and China respectively – even if the company says it will return to better profitability with new model lines like A5 and A6 coming on stream. In a response to shifting trends and wider competition, Audi has already announced a shaping up of its business at the top company level. The aim is to reduce management bloat and speed up the development of new models, with Will saying the Hungary facility has a big role to play. ‘We’re ready to support AG,’ he says, adding that the facility also provides a huge amount of technical development for the Group. ‘We have a real impact at an early stage [in the development of new models] through our technology centres here,’ adds Will (pictured below). The Gyor plant’s strategy of working on different projects at once seems to be working. Slightly relaxed strategies regarding the pace of electrification and Audi’s renewed focus on its new, hyper-efficient ‘Premium Platform Combustion’ cars could see Hungary remain a crucial plant. That, and the fact that it’s not got all its eggs in the electrification basket – unlike the Brussels factory – has meant it’s seemingly not a target for layoffs or closures. ‘The e-mobility transition is not new to us,’ says Will. ‘The company started making electric motors in 2018 and, since then, more than 600,000 electric motors have been manufactured in Gyor. Series production of PPE drive units started in 2023, and the company is preparing for the next generation of e-drives.’ That next generation will be the units powering cars running on the SSP (Scalable Systems Platform) architecture, meaning Gyor’s place in the world seems secure. While the Audi brand and wider VW Group are experiencing a structural earthquake, Gyor seems to only be feeling light tremors.

248,Meet e-Vitara: Suzuki’s first battery-electric car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/suzuki/evitara/,Jake Groves,2024-11-11,Car Magazine UK,"Suzuki has revealed its first-ever battery-electric production car: the new e-Vitara. Feels a bit weird for this to be the brand’s first, given how far along so many other brands are with their electrification strategies. But Suzuki will not be rushed, instead relying on partnerships with Toyota to offer full and plug-in hybrid models as it develops its own technology. The design of the new e-Vitara is based off the – a small, chunky EV show car that first made its debut at the 2023 Tokyo Auto Salon. It’s chunky and bulky in all the usual SUV ways, with plenty of cladding and an aggressive frown on its face. Inside, the new e-Vitara has a pair of screens for driver’s instruments and infotainment, and a reasonably tidy interior layout that includes physical switchgear. The more interesting bits are under the skin, though. Suzuki has used a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack here – known for being cheaper and less reliant on rare earths than a more conventional lithium-manganese-cobalt mix – and it runs on a battery-electric version of its ‘HEARTECT’ platform that underpins countless other models. For Europe, the e-Vitara comes in a few powertrain flavours. The entry level model features a 49kWh battery pack and a single e-motor on the front axle developing 142bhp. There are also two power variants for the larger 61kWh battery pack: a 172bhp front-driven model or a 236bhp all-wheel drive model. All e-Vitara models feature an ‘e-axle’ that incorporates the electric motor and inverter, with the all-wheel drive model also featuring a Trail drive mode for extra grip off-road. Range and performance figures haven’t been announced yet. ‘We will provide a variety of options, including BEVs, hybrid vehicles and CNG behicles tailored to specific regions,’ says Toshihiro Suzuki, company president. ‘Following the launch of the e-Vitara, we will continue to expand our BEV line-up.’ The new e-Vitara will go on sale in the summer of 2025.

249,‘It’s our job to make sure Lamborghini will be acceptable in the next decade’ – Lambo CEO Stephan Winkelmann,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lamborghini/stephan-winkelmann/,Tim Pollard,2024-11-12,Car Magazine UK,"CAR magazine recently sat down with Stephan Winkelmann, chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, to talk about the state of the business, what keeps him awake at night – and the new range of electrified models under development for launch later this decade as part of strategy towards electrification. Read on for our exclusive interview. ‘We are a three-model company and our order bank between the three lines is an average of one-and-a-half years, which is really healthy. The residual values are very strong, they are often higher than the new car prices. This is a very good situation. This means that the brand has an image which is hopefully going to last over the next few years and keep growing. And last year, for the first time, we delivered more than 10,000 cars globally – so we are trying to keep the balance right, not only in terms of order bank, but also in terms of distribution around the globe. ‘I don’t see big growth in the future. It’s not really about this. It’s more about getting more margin out of every single car, because we are in a small segment and it’s more about personalisation than just the sheer number of cars. And this is what creates for us the additional margin.’ ‘Yes. The bottleneck is on us, and not the customers. The complexity industrialising all the different colours, specs and materials is huge for a small company like ours. We are getting there, step by step, but this is where we see more and more opportunities for Lamborghini.’ ‘In terms of volumes, not so much. But for sure, if we have a fourth model line, there would be a bigger number because we’ll be entering a different segment.’ ‘We said we already have two supercars – the and Revuelto – which are not overlapping, and we have an SUV, the Urus, which is a totally different car. ‘So we looked at the idea to make a GT car, which is what we chose at the end of the day. But we also looked at another SUV, which we rejected, and a limousine, which we had already considered with the Estoque back in 2008 [below]. It was a concept which we had to develop further – it had a long wheelbase and we concluded that a long wheelbase does not always look that good. ‘More and more these days, if you are going to do a limo, it’s about a long wheelbase and it’s not aimed at Europe, it’s more for Asia and North America. And a third supercar was not an option. We were very keen not to put too much cannibalisation between the cars.’ ‘It’s clear we have to find synergies between the two supercars and the more daily useable cars. Ferruccio Lamborghini back in the beginning of the 1960s started with GT cars, don’t forget: the 350 GT, the 400 GT, the Espada, all of these cars had front engines. In terms of the bodystyle, we said we must get the best out of both worlds – a GT car, a 2+2, with two doors, but with more ground clearance. Because this is something which our development research over the past decade showed us that more and more people want to sit high up, because if you have a daily user, it’s much more comfortable, you feel safer and this in combination with a platform where you can create synergies… well, for us that was the winning idea.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Yes, after Lanzador.’ ‘We just call it the . That stands for Super Electric!’ ‘The demographics show that the oldest customers of the Urus are the Europeans, followed by the Americans and the youngest ones are from Asia. Our Asian clients are usually single or young couples. The Urus buyer does tend to be a family person, we don’t have many single people buying these. How do we know this? Because we always meet our customers at events – they talk about their kids and how they are influenced to buy this type of car.’ ‘We can’t be much better positioned, in my opinion. The choices we’ve made in terms of design, the types of performance car we offer and how we put them together are all working. It’s on us to protect our volumes, our distribution, the proposition of our brand. Ultimately we are selling dreams and we have to go the extra mile to get this technological innovation into the cars, because we must exceed the expectations of our customers. ‘We are not selling basic mobility. This is the famous Yolo effect: . It runs counter to war, the geopolitical situation in general and problems in the supply chain. Of course these affect our customers. We understand that markets can plateau and we have to deal with it. We cannot think the sky is the limit every day. It’s partly why for us customers are part of a club – owning one of our cars is only the first step in Lamborghini ownership. Engaging customers is paramount for the success of tomorrow. They have to feel embraced, they have to feel that they are in a community. This is really strong in the UK: you are our third biggest market, don’t forget…’ ‘Supercars are about design and performance. What we have to achieve in the design is pretty easy in a sense. If I look at our cars in comparison with the other luxury exclusive or super sports car manufacturers, we are very sharply positioned and very recognisable – even though the car is completely different, usually you don’t have a problem in recognising a Lamborghini. This cannot be anything else but a Lamborghini, you know. ‘But when we speak about performance, it’s different, because performance in Lamborghini can be divided into two types. One is about raw numbers: the track laptimes, braking distances from 100-0kph and so on. This is the engineers’ job – but they also have another task, which is the emotional side of driving. How you feel about the car, how it reacts. This is very different if you drive a Lambo. This is the biggest challenge we have when it comes to electrification. ‘I think we are dealing with this quite well with our hybrids – they’re reassuring in a way, because it’s underlining the performance. They’re fun to drive, but CO2 emissions are reduced at the same time. We underline the performance to our customers, yet we are reducing CO2 emissions big time because otherwise we cannot sell our cars anymore. So the biggest challenge for us is to take across this emotion from the hybrids to the full electric world. There are good opportunities with software, but the only thing which is missing, which we will never replicate, is the sound.’ ‘The Urus is a facelift, but yes, it is a completely new line-up for us. This was a big effort for the entire team in the past four years – it was a slog, we were running flat-out. It was not easy to accomplish.’ ‘We cannot talk about the size of the investment, unfortunately. It’s not a Lamborghini policy, it’s a group rule.’ ‘They are daily drivers, absolutely. The average mileage for an Urus customer is around 10,000-11,000km a year (6200-6800 miles), but for the super-sports cars, it is 5000-6000km (3000-3700 miles) annually. Our customers have a lot of cars in their garage – typically five or more.’ ‘We’re working on it. We have a lot of things which we want to accomplish with the fourth model range, so we have to look carefully about when to launch it and how, because it’s our first electric car and it has to be a hit. ‘The decision of when to launch is a combination of the decisions which are coming up in the next couple of years around legislation. We have to consider if authorities will dilute regulations or not, what will happen to the acceptance of BEVs in society and so on. But the strategy is very clear. We want to go BEV [a pure battery electric vehicle] with this fourth model.’ ‘We showed the car at Pebble Beach for its world premiere. It was pretty positive. Some people say, “Ah, please put an engine in it!” but the majority of our customer base understand why we are making it electric and they say if anyone can pull it off, it’s Lamborghini.’ ‘It’s important to underline that we are not only a super-sports car company. We can do much more. The Sterrato [below] was an exercise which I was pushing to make happen, because I was sure it would be a a huge success. It was a great way to see out the Huracan at the end of its production run. This is what Lamborghini is good at doing.’ ‘Top speed in my opinion and acceleration have become a commodity. In the past, there were turbo cars or big-engine cars which were faster than us in acceleration and top speed runs – but they never affected our sales, because our DNA is not just about that. It’s about the feeling, the design and the handling behaviour of the car, not just the outright numbers.’ ‘I do have a big sense of urgency. For a manufacturer like Lamborghini we are in a phase of our development where it is of the utmost importance to do the right thing. It is not an evolution anymore. It’s not about more power or bigger engines. No. It’s our job to make sure Lamborghini will be acceptable in the next decade. It’s a really important transition phase.’ ‘In a way, yes. But it’s a very positive challenge.’ ‘You should not decide too quickly about the things which are going to happen in your business, because it’s in constant flux and you have to give your people some freedom. You also have to take care of your team and you have to invest in technology. You must look forward, but you also have to build up a team which follows you. You cannot just put them in a corridor and look in one direction. Decisions and belief have to come out of the team. They have to want the same thing.

250,Porsche Taycan GTS launched: completing the set,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/taycan/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-11-13,Car Magazine UK,"If you didn’t see this one coming, you might want to get your eyes tested. Porsche improved every other model in the Taycan range earlier this year with better battery technology and snappier electric motors – and it’s now peppered the same improvements over the GTS. That’s made a fast EV even faster. This new Taycan GTS has 690bhp, which is a whopping 100bhp more than the previous version of the car. The extra poke means it can now sprint from 0–62mph in just 3.3 seconds (0.4 seconds faster than before) and thrash from 0–124mph in 10.4 seconds (a whopping 1.6 seconds faster than the old car). It also benefits from the same battery improvements as the rest of the Taycan range. We’ll explain them in greater detail below, but the upshot is that the car can now drive a further 74 miles before running out of electricity. According to the WLTP cycle, anyway. To set the GTS apart from its sister cars, it gets 20-inch alloy wheels, Matrix LED headlights, some slightly sportier front and rear aprons (painted black, naturally), a pair of deeper GTS-branded sports seats and some choice ‘GTS’ badges on the boot lid and treadplates. The chassis gets a couple of tweaks, too. You get adaptive dampers and torque vectoring as standard, although you can specify Porsche’s snazzy Active Ride suspension as an optional extra. Porsche has also designed a unique EV sound profile to suit the GTS. The Taycan GTS is available to order now – and you can have it as either a saloon or an estate (which is infinitely cooler in our opinion). The former costs £117,500, while the latter will set you back £118,300. First deliveries are expected to arrive in early 2025. Quite a lot. So much, in fact, that Porsche felt it necessary to rebrand the car’s platform. The updated car’s architecture is dubbed J1 II, as opposed to the original car’s J1 branding. Range matters, and the new Taycan has a decent chunk more of it thanks to increased efficiency and an upgrade for its bigger Performance Battery Plus, up to 105kWh gross and 97kWh usable. An all-new unit with new cell chemistry, it brings increased power density, more current and reduced sensitivity to temperature – handy for rapid charging in colder climes. It flows energy to (and from) a lighter, more compact and more powerful electric motor, driving a car that’s a smidge lighter than the first-gen Taycan (by around 15kg, despite a more lavish level of standard equipment) and a good chunk more efficient. WLTP power consumption is now 3.45 miles per kWh for the tyre-melting Turbo S (versus 2.84 miles per kWh for the current car) and 3.72 miles per kWh (versus 3.17) for the charge-sipping, single-motor Taycan. Together with the bigger battery, that means range is up by around 35% depending on the model. The Turbo S saloon goes from 291 miles to 391 miles WLTP, while the single-motor, rear-drive Taycan with the optional bigger battery climbs from around 313 miles to a hefty 421. ‘Do they, though?’ I hear you cry – and congratulations on your healthy cynicism. The answer of course is no, they do not. The true figure? A week before the car’s global reveal we climbed behind the wheel of a single-motor model on low-drag 19-inch wheels . A few hours later we’d managed 365 miles without charging, the consumption read-out showing mostly 3.6 miles per kWh. That’s not 421 miles or 3.72 miles per kWh, granted, but it’s within a sniff of the official consumption figures – and impressive when you consider the improvement over the first-gen car. And let’s not forget, it’s a high-performance EV. The Taycan continues with three body styles (saloon, Sport Turismo and Cross Turismo) and more electric motor options than a Tamiya R/C car. The rear-drive, single-motor saloon is up to £86,500 (up from £79,200), the popular 4S £95,900 (up from £90,700) and the Turbo S £161,400 (up from £148,300). Did anyone ask for a faster Taycan? No matter. Porsche has built one anyway, upgrading the entire powertrain to boost the Turbos S by 188bhp to 939bhp and the rear-drive car by 80bhp to 402bhp. That’s enough to drop the Turbo S’s 0–62mph time to a breakfast-churning 2.4sec, and the single-motor car’s to a hardly-tardy 4.8sec. But if you’re hunting for the most efficient means of jettisoning the contents of your stomach, you’re going to want the Turbo GT. It has a scarcely believable 1020bhp and a 0–62mph time of just 2.3 seconds. That’s enough to demolish most supercars. Wondering what it’s like? Wonder no longer, because . The new model promises to be faster around corners too, having ditched the previous car’s 48-volt roll control system for a version of the Panamera’s electro-hydraulic Active Ride. Air suspension is now also standard, and in too come Porsche’s new two-valve dampers. Our limited experience to date (a twisty-road passenger ride in Germany and the freeway drive in California) would suggest the ride is more compliant and the body control as resolute as ever. Charging capacity is up 50kW, from 270kW to 320kW, and when you can find a suitably powerful charger the results are impressive. We see 320kW on the charger display in both freezing cold Germany and balmy California, and on one charge take on an indicated 46kWh – or 165 miles of range in the rear-drive car – in just eight minutes. Just as you’d be forgiven for failing to spot the changes externally, so the new Taycan isn’t an entirely different beast inside, either. But things have changed. The car gets new functionality within its charging planner, such as a list of places to eat and shop in the area, video streaming on the passenger screen (blocked from the driver while you’re moving, but gorge on by all means as you charge), sleeker instrument graphics complete with an indicator of the car’s readiness for charging, and scope for personalisation within each drive mode (selected via a now standard drive mode rotary controller on the steering wheel) rather than a single customisable Individual drive mode. There’s also Porsche’s version of CarPlay, co-developed with Apple, which allows you to do stuff like switch radio stations and set the climate control without having to endlessly head out of CarPlay and into the car’s native infotainment. Informed by data running from the car via the My Porsche app into iOS, there’s also now a charging planner within Apple Maps. Still top dog? Some rivals are more powerful (for now at least – Porsche’s wild ‘Turbo GT’ Taycan, possibly with three motors, looks to be just around the corner), while others go further. But the Taycan’s winning blend of style, speed and usability looks to have remained intact, while range, efficiency, comfort and power have all headed in the right direction.

251,"282.05mph: Bugatti Mistral takes open-top car world record",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bugatti/mistral/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-11-14,Car Magazine UK,"Bugatti’s W16 Mistral World Record Car has just taken the top speed record for open-topped cars. It clocked 453.91km/h or 282.05mph at the ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg facility in Germany and follows other records for the marque; a Veyron Super Sport cracked 431.07kmh (267.85mph) in June 2010, and a Chiron Super Sport 300+ clocked 490.48kmh or 304.77mph in 2019. More relevant, though, is the 408.84km/h (254.04mph) achieved by a Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse – which did so with the top down. Andy Wallace, a Bugatti Pilote Officiel and Le Mans-winner was at the controls and first positioned the car on the banking at 124mph, before gradually increasing to the new record. As you’d expect, the World Record Car, valued at €14million, is a little different to the standard version: it features ‘Jet Orange’ highlights inside and out, like Bugatti’s previous record cars. ‘The Bugatti World Record Cars throughout the marque’s history have represented the epitome of speed and power, setting new boundaries and redefining again and again, what Bugatti vehicles are capable of,’ said Bugatti CEO, Mate Rimac. ‘And now, with the unparalleled achievement of the W16 Mistral World Record Car etched into the history books, we see history not just repeating itself, but new history made.’ Keep reading for everything you need to know about the ‘standard’ car. This is the Bugatti Mistral, a W16-powered roadster that is to the what the was to the regular . It’s also an indication that Maserati’s copyright ran out on the Mistral name, allowing Bugatti to join a selection of VW Group cars named after winds such as the , Jetta, Bora and Scirroco. Less flippantly, the name indicates the car’s ‘wind-in-your-hair’ design – while there will be a roof, it’s more intended for temporary or emergency use. First and foremost, this is an open-topped car. Mistral is also a French wind, blowing from the Rhone River Valley through the Cote d’Azur and into the Mediterranean. And despite , the brand’s very proud of its French heritage and would like to be seen as a French automobile brand. It’ll be shown off to the public during Monterey Car Week, at The Quail – but there’ll be no point rootling down the back of the sofa trying to stump up the Mistral’s 5 million Euro price tag, as all 99 examples have already been sold. Sort of. The Mistral shares a lot with the Chiron and looks quite similar, but Bugatti’s keen to point out that they haven’t just taken a hacksaw to the roof – it’s re-engineered and redesigned. Roadsters are rarely just an afterthought for the brand, and in fact 45% of all Bugatti vehicles ever created have been open-topped. The front of the Mistral takes on a more vertical motif than the Chiron, with stacked headlights and a deeper, wider horseshoe grille more akin to exclusive models like the or . The windscreen and top line of the windows give a real wraparound ‘visor’ effect, hiding the A-pillars and providing a modern interpretation of the ‘Grand Raid’ Type 57, a 1934 roadster bodied by Gangloff. The Grand Raid also provides the colour scheme for the first Mistral, which is a warm black with yellow accents. That’s a personal homage to Ettore Bugatti, who chose yellow and black for many of his own cars. Of course, customer cars will be painted in whatever hue is desired, with launch models rendered in Chiron blue, black and white. The airflow’s been very carefully split up with clever aero. The engine air intakes now sit on the roof, just behind the occupants’ heads – a further nod to the Veyron Grand Sport. They’re also strong enough to take on the duty of rollover hoops. This leaves the air down the sides free for the oil coolers. The taillights take on an ‘X’ shaped motif, and the negative space between them is used to vent the side radiators. Even the headlights have gaps between the LED bars, which funnel air out through the wheel arch to improve aerodynamic drag. You’ll find the Super Sport powertrain mounted just behind the driver – namely, Bugatti’s 8.0-litre W16 engine, here producing 1600 PS (1,578bhp). Bugatti’s targeting a 261mph top speed, which while not the fastest open-topped car ever does mean it’s no slouch. It marks the last time this engine will be used in a road-going Bugatti – the end of an era that began with the Veyron in 2005. The design team kept very quiet about the future, saying only that it would be hybrid – but didn’t seem too sold on the idea. As design chief Achim Anscheidt admitted ‘I can stand here and give you all the design talk, but without the W16 engine this car has no selling point’. ‘We know the W16 Mistral will always have significance in the story of Bugatti, marking the last time that perhaps the greatest ever automotive powertrain is used in the roadgoing production car.’ When further pressed, Bugatti execs stuck to the company line, saying only that the new hybrid powertrain would ‘pay respect to Bugatti’. The interior’s very similar to the Chiron, with milled titanium and aluminium components set into a simple, curvaceous dash. What you won’t find is inch after inch of screen – Bugatti wants its cars to be collectors items that will function just as well many years later, something it doesn’t think can be done if the interior relies on delicate screens and fiddly software. Anscheidt admits that most of Bugatti’s fabulously wealthy customers use their smartphones for navigation if they need to – just like the rest of us plebs – but that driving one of their cars is a consciously tech-free experience. They prefer exquisite materials and craftsmanship to the latest tech that’ll soon look dated. After all, very few Bugattis are daily drivers – a suction-cup phone mount would rather spoil the effect. ‘Will a screen still work as well in 15 or 30 years?’ he asks. ‘Even a Bugatti made today needs to be able to sit on the lawn at Pebble Beach in 30 years and still work.’ The colour scheme inside is once again inspired by warm black (with tones of brown) and yellow. A fabulous ‘woven’ leather appears on the seats and door cards. Handmade, of course – machine-cut experiments were too regular and boring. Another nod to the past is in the gear selector, where a figure of a dancing elephant is encased in amber-like resin. It’s a homage to Rembrandt Bugatti’s famous sculpture, copies of which adorned the bonnet of the Type 41 Royale as Ettore’s tribute to his brother’s artwork. No. All 99 examples were sold before the public reveal (when we saw the car at a media reveal event a few weeks ago, Anscheidt was confident they would be) and even if you found yourself on that exclusive list, you’d have to shell out 5 million Euros for the privilege. Most will have found themselves as exhibits in private collections – automotive art, designed to be admired first and driven second. A shame, given it’s the last outing for that glorious engine. Mate Rimac, Bugatti Rimac CEO, said: ‘The union of a roadster format and our W16 powertrain is absolute perfection. With the roof removed, and a pair of large air intakes directly behind your head feeding around 70,000 liters of air through the engine every minute at full bore, driving the W16 Mistral connects you to the intricate workings of this revolutionary powertrain like no other Bugatti to date.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
252,"Renault 5 E-Tech Electric to start from £22,995",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/5-e-tech/,Jake Groves,2024-11-19,Car Magazine UK,"Prices for the stylish new Renault 5 E-Tech have finally been confirmed, with the chic electric hatchback starting from £22,995. It makes it one of the on sale, with prices close to both the and both of which will arrive at a similar time to the new Renault 5 next spring. Full prices and trim levels are detailed towards the bottom of this story. The Renault 5 EV made its debut at (one of the very few new models being revealed at this year’s show), with sales imminently opening up for many markets across Europe – as well as the UK, and 50,000 orders being taken in the first week after its reveal. After spending some time with the car ahead of its reveal, talking to designers and engineers, CAR magazine has the full debrief on the official production model of the new Renault 5 EV right here. Let’s get started, shall we? We’re certain. The story goes that, when current Groupe Renault CEO Luca De Meo entered his post, Renault’s design teams brought him into a conference room to show all the ongoing models and projects they were working on. According to Paula Fabregat, Design Project Director for A and B-segment cars, ‘it took him five seconds’ to scan the room full of sketches and mock-ups to then point at the 5 concept (one of the least concrete projects at the time) and say ‘build it,’ challenging the design team to craft it as close to the mock-up as possible. A tall order, to put it mildly. Now, though, Renault happily brags that the real thing is 95 per cent like . The dinky headlights and squat proportions, the angled rear much like the original trimmed with an aerodynamic spoiler ‘like the one from a Turbo’, according to Fabregat, all point to that legendary original. Even the vent on the bonnet of the original has been echoed with this new generation, with a number ‘5’ split into backlit sections that show off your battery percentage. Many tasty links to Renault’s past with the 5– and yet, ‘you won’t find a single vintage element!’ claims Fabregat. Hmm. ‘The older generations will relate and have a connection to the 5,’ says Gilles Vidal, Renault’s design director, ‘but my kids are fairly young, for example, and they don’t know these old cars. We designed this car so it would be interesting and attractive for what it is, without needing to relate to its history.’ All these supposedly retro details aren’t there just for show; that spoiler and those Y-spoke alloy wheels add five miles of possible range each, while the wraparound fins in the rear lights add another four. And Renault is more than happy to amp up the car’s cutesy appeal: the DRL’s will ‘wink’ at you as you unlock it, for example. Renault’s new EV has a broadly similar footprint and overall shape to the Clio and is designed to replace . It’s 3.92m long, 1.77m wide, 1.5m tall (making it a smidge shorter and slimmer, if taller) and features a wheelbase 2.54m long. The boot volume is rated to 326-litres with the seats up. It’s a mix of kitsch and contemporary inside. Some of the dashboard design elements as well as the shapes of the seats are inspired by various versions of the original R5, including the padded and stitched passenger-side dashboard moulding. Every 5 features digital instruments and a large infotainment system running a Google OS model as standard. On top of having Google technology in-built, the 5 will also feature a virtual assistant named Reno. The VA is powered by ChatGPT (which is very on-trend) and is designed to help coach EV newbies and get the most out of the car. Renault says you can ask it questions like how to pair your phone to the car, or how to change a tyre. Stuck in traffic? Reno will suggest going into Eco mode to save power. Got the windows open and the air-con on? Reno will ask if you want to switch off the air-con. Sounds a bit naggy? It does to us, but Renault assures us the prompts won’t be too intrusive. Naturally there are some common Renault Group parts to be found, including the physical (hurrah!) climate control dials and electronic parking brake lever seen in cheaper Renault models like the Clio and Captur. But regardless of what trim you go for, you’ll sit on upholstery made from recycled materials and prod 3D-printed parts. Upholstery colours will almost entirely depend on trim, mind you, but Renault will also offer you the change to customise the drive shift stalk with a range of different clip-on attachments that sort of look like lipsticks. Renault will also offer other accessories, including a baguette holder that clips onto the centre console. Generally, it’s a pretty wild mix of the 2020s and 1970s inside. The new 5 is the first car to use the Renault Group’s AmpR Small platform, which, up until 2023, was nicknamed CMF-BEV. The architecture will be used by Renault, as well as Dacia, Alpine for , Nissan for and Mitsubishi. AmpR Small is engineered to be as efficient and light as it can be, using existing parts from the combustion-powered Clio and Captur to save cost and new techniques to keep the weight down. Some weight has been saved with the e-motor as well as the platform; the one used in the 5 is a reworked (and less powerful) version seen in , which saves 20 kilos. All of this means that the 5’s maximum weight clocks in at 1450kg – a figure that Vincent Theuillon, EV Platform Manager, tells us ‘is about the same as the heaviest version of the Captur.’ Two battery packs – a 40kWh one promising 190 miles of range, and a 52kWh one claiming a more reasonable 248 miles – and three power variants (94, 118 and 148bhp) will be available. The lower two power options are linked to the smaller battery, while the 148bhp e-motor is only available with the 52kWh battery. The entry-level 94bhp model is not being sold in the UK. Performance-wise, the most powerful model will launch from 0-62mph in under 7.9 seconds and runs out of puff at 93mph. The 118hp model has the same top speed but takes 9.2 seconds to get to 62mph. As for charging, Renault says the new 5 will charge at up to either 80kW for the base-level e-motor or 100kW with the two more powerful e-motors. Regardless of which you pick, Renault claims a 30-minute charge from 15-80 per cent. And as well as aiming to lower costs at the point of purchase, bi-directional charging allows you to feed energy from your 5 into the grid to lower your electricity bills (so long as you get a wallbox and tariff from Renault’s Mobilize division) and it’ll even power domestic items via an adapter – just like Hyundai and Kia’s V2L technology. UK prices for the Renault 5 E-Tech start from £22,995, making it one the cheapest new EVs available. That price buys the Evolution trim, which is only available with the 118bhp motor. Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10.1-inch touchscreen and climate control. Full LED lights are also included, along with rear parking sensors and keyless entry. The Techno costs from £24,995 (or £26,995 with the larger battery) and adds adaptive cruise control, two-tone paint, a reversing camera and a ‘5’ bonnet charging indicator. At the top of the range, the Iconic 5 trim is available from £26,995 and brings heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and additional semi-autonomous driving aids. Full orders for the Renault 5 E-Tech open in January 2025, with first demonstrators in dealers in March. Customer cars are expected ‘shortly afterwards’, says Renault.

253,Stellantis STLA platforms: STLA Frame features 500-mile EV and 690-mile range extender options,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/stellantis-stla/,Jake Groves,2024-11-19,Car Magazine UK,"Automotive mega-group Stellantis is in the process of rolling out its wave of new ‘EV native’ STLA platforms across all of its major brands. The four STLA platforms (Small, Medium, Large and Frame) are designed to unify all its brands under a set of architectures based on size. All of the STLA platforms are designed to run not just battery-electric powertrains but ones that use hybridised combustion engines, too. Stellantis is playing the powertrain field even wider with its larger platforms. ‘This, from a flexibility standpoint, is a very significant strength,’ says Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO. ‘We have to manage the uncertainty and manage the transition. We offer the consumer the power of choice on the basis of these four STLA platforms – they are all multi energy.’ Medium is rolling out, with models like the and , as well as the new also using the architecture. The next to hit dealers will be cars based on Large, which includes the new that will launch in Europe in the middle of 2025. Next to get the focus of attention is STLA Frame – arguably the most self-explanatory. It’s a body-on-frame platform designed for the biggest and toughest vehicles in Stellantis’ portfolio. In 2025, we’ll likely start to see more regarding STLA Small as the project comes to development fruition. We’ve got all you need to know on all four of Stellantis’ new platforms, so keep reading. STLA Small will benefit all brands that have city cars and superminis in their portfolios. This platform allows for battery capacities between 37 and 82kWh, with a range target of 300 miles. New EVs expected to use this platform include the next generation of small cars from the likes of Opel/Vauxhall, Peugeot, Fiat and Citroen. ‘With STLA Small, we’re talking about compact cars,’ says Tavares in a press conference on 19 November 2024; ‘that will come late 2025, maybe early 2026 – that is the appropriate time for its presentation.’ Medium was the first of the new STLA architectures to come on stream. Battery ranges were originally planned to be between 87 and 104kWh when first announced in 2021, but the aforementioned Peugeot uses a smaller 74kWh pack. Medium also allows for mild hybrid combustion engine variants, as well as EVs that can claim more than 400 miles on a charge. Stellantis says Large will be used for upcoming ‘D and E-segment’ cars by Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Maserati – and the first cars to deploy the platform are the SUV and . In fact, eight car launches using STLA Large will happen between now and 2026, including replacements for the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio and possibly a new DS model. STLA Large is designed to be ultra-flexible, offering both 400- and 800-volt architectures, and has been designed to cater to high-performance cars as well as properly capable off-roaders. Front-, rear- and all-wheel drive configurations are possible using Stellantis’ own ‘EDM’ electric motors. As for power and performance, this is where Stellantis seems to be hitting a home run. Battery sizes of between 85 and 118kWh are possible, with up to 500 miles of range claimed for the sleekest and lowest saloons that will use STLA Large (like the expected from 2026). On top of that, Stellantis says cars running on STLA Large could sprint to 62mph in as little as two seconds, and points out that the most potent cars running on STLA Large ‘will outperform any of the existing Hellcat V8s.’ Having an 800-volt architecture as an option also allows cars running STLA Large to collect 4.5kWh of battery charge per minute. The newest in focus, and a self-explanatory body-on-frame chassis. Stellantis says that this is only for use by Ram and Jeep, and has been entirely developed in the US given Stellantis North America’s experience with this type of architecture. Frame is quite possibly the most flexible of all the STLA platforms, as Stellantis says it can run combustion, hybrid and battery-electric powertrains as well as range extenders and even hydrogen fuel cell configurations. Naturally, this platform will be what Ram’s future generation of trucks runs on, as well as the next-generation Wrangler. Choose a Frame BEV and you’d benefit from a truck or 4×4 that’s capable of up to 500 miles on a charge, and can use either a 400 or 800-volt electrical architecture. But Stellantis is also launching a range extender (which it labels as a REEV) that can reach 690 miles of total range. Naturally, given this is a platform for trucks, Stellantis is also keen to point out STLA Frame’s 6350kg towing capacity, as well as its 1224kg payload capacity. As for the powertrains, Stellantis announced in 2021 that it will use three separate electronic drive modules. will be 400V and put out 70kW (93bhp) per unit, making it light and handy for small city cars that don’t require much power, or around 186bhp if applied to each axle for electric all-wheel drive. , too, is 400V and can range in power from 125kW to 180kW (164bhp to 241bhp). can work with either a 400V or 800V electronic architecture, delivering between 150kW and 330kW (201bhp to 443bhp).

254,"New Hyundai Ioniq 9: big space, big tech, big electric range… just plain BIG",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/ioniq-9/,Jake Groves,2024-11-21,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has revealed its new Ioniq 9 SUV – the flagship electric model for its sub-brand that’ll be the star of the 2024 LA Auto Show. As the number suggests, the Ioniq 9 is the biggest EV Hyundai has created, with the new EV offering huge space and plenty of flexibility for the family. We have been up close and personal with the Ioniq 9 in Los Angeles ahead of its reveal – this is everything you need to know. Isn’t it just. In fact, the Ioniq 9 is so large that it’s taller, longer and has a longer wheelbase than the Palisade SUV – a ‘full-size’ model that’s sold in North America. It measures in at 5060mm in length, 1980mm in width and 1970mm tall. Hyundai also says it has the longest wheelbase of any production car the brand has ever built, at 3170mm. For European context, that makes it slightly longer than a , as well as the – a sibling to the Hyundai. That said, when you’re stood next to it, it doesn’t actually feel as large as it looks – almost the opposite effect (to our eye, anyway) as the design effects of the . There are naturally plenty of design details meant to link it to the rest of the Ioniq range. Simon Loasby, head of Hyundai’s design centre, talks of chess pieces and how they belong to the same family, but have unique details. You can still see the brand’s ‘parametric pixel’ lights front and rear, but the Ioniq 9 has had inspiration taken from yachts and engineering. Depending on colour and spec, plenty of elements in the wheelarches will be black, rather than entirely body-coloured; Hyundai offers a range of colours beyond this pretty drab satin colour, including a fantastic dark green. We first saw how the Ioniq 9 would look with the Seven Concept. ‘Usability was the main thing we wanted to carry across [from concept to production],’ Loasby tells CAR, ‘as well as the practicality of the space and the efficiency of how the car moves through the air. We could have gone quite boxy and give a daunting impression to the car, but we already have Palisade and Santa Fe –  we don’t necessarily need everything in that boxy camp.’ Loasby points to the very rounded front end and steeply raked windscreen that are designed to cut through the air better and leave less of an imposing shape in other drivers’ rear-view mirrors – so much so that the Ioniq 9 boasts a reasonably slippery 0.269Cd drag co-efficient, or 0.259 with optional camera mirrors. Why not call this an Ioniq 7, to carry on the naming convention from the concept car? ‘We wanted to create space in the range,’ says Loasby. ‘It’s our biggest car here, so we’re creating space for who knows what in between.’ Naturally, an Ioniq 7 and Ioniq 8 are on the way in the future. That’s the plan. Naturally, there are a lot of classic Hyundai design cues inside, including two wide displays that sit on top of the dashboard for the drivers’ instruments and main infotainment display and a chunky steering wheel. Recycled materials are everywhere, and the interior can be had in a range of colours. But, given this is a family bus, Hyundai’s played as many utilitarian cards as it can. When sat in the front, what you’ll notice is a completely open centre console area allowing you to jump between seats easily. Nestled between the front seats is the Universal Island 2.0 – a large storage area that can slide fore and aft, even as far back as the second row. There are switches and charging areas on board, as well as climate controls for the rear occupants and an armrest storage lid that can be opened both ways. Elsewhere, Hyundai has included a UV sanitisation station for your devices and its software allows you to download new features after you’ve bought the car. Utilising the E-GMP platform’s flat floor allows loads of flexibility in the second and third row. Like the EV9, the Hyundai Ioniq 9 can be had with a more conventional seven-seat configuration or a six-seat layout that features two captain’s chairs in the second row. If you choose the six-seat layout, those second-row chairs include Hyundai’s ‘relaxation seat’ technology that allows them to recline far and feature a leg rest, and can be kitted out with massaging functions. They also can swivel, allowing for easy entry and exit or giving those inside the opportunity to turn around 180-degrees to sit face-to-face with those in the third row. Hyundai points out that you can only turn the chairs around when the car is stationary. Space is impressive, too. During our time with the car, we sat in all three rows. I’m 6’2” and managed to find the third row easy to get into and comfortable once I was in place. All three rows feature cupholders and charge points. As for boot volume, Hyundai quotes a 620-litre space with all three rows up and 1323 litres with the third row folded down. There’s also a frunk – useful for charging cables and so on – that either holds 88 litres in the rear-driven models, or 52 litres in the all-wheel drive models. Of course. Given the wheelbase stretch, the Ioniq 9 features the largest battery ever housed in an E-GMP car: 110.3kWh, which is standard across all variants. The Ioniq 9 comes in three performance flavours, and they’re a bit self-explanatory: Long Range RWD, Long Range AWD and Performance AWD. Hyundai is still homologating the Ioniq 9’s variants, but we have certain range and performance specs for certain models. : Single e-motor, 215bhp, 258lb ft : 8.4sec (0-62mph TBC) : TBC : 385 miles (WLTP projected) : Two e-motors, 309bhp, 446lb ft : 6.2sec (0-62mph TBC) : 124mph : TBC : Two e-motors, 429bhp, 516lb ft : 5.2sec : 124mph : TBC Proper European trim level specs haven’t been confirmed yet, but we’d expect the trim walk-up to start with Premium and rise to Ultimate and Calligraphy. If the Ioniq 9 is anything like any other high-end Hyundai model, expect even the ‘base’ Premium trim to have plenty on it. We also predict that the Ioniq 9 will inevitably benefit from an N-Line trim variant later down the car’s production run. But, what about a full-fat N? Maybe. ‘At the end of the day, [the Ioniq 9] is a big, heavy car and it consumes a hell of a lot of power,’ says Loasby, ‘so maybe for some of our cars it’s not as appropriate as others, but we feel our brand can stretch that far. I think the progression for N will be to tap into more sophistication with the performance, and here we have a car that is super sophisticated.’ Given this is an E-GMP car, the Ioniq 9 runs an 800-volt electrical architecture that allows for 350kW fast charging – Hyundai claims 24 minutes from 10-80 per cent at that peak rate. Here, though, the Ioniq 9 can switch to running its electric systems at 400-volts to ensure fast charging on older chargers. The brand’s also features, accessed via an adapter like on the Ioniq 5 and . Hyundai also points to the Ioniq 9’s Chassis Domain Control Unit that’s designed to help keep the car stable in cornering, while triple-glazed glass and active noise cancellation aims to keep the cabin quiet at speed. Camera mirrors are on the options list, too. The Ioniq 9 runs a conventional multi-link suspension system front and rear – no air springs here, or rear-wheel steering for that matter – but says the rear features self-levelling dampers. Euro-spec Ioniq 9 models can also tow up to 2500kg. Hyundai says the Ioniq 9 will go on sale in Korea and North America in early 2025, with other markets to follow later on in the year.

255,Mercedes is working on ‘cylinder deactivation for batteries’ and solar bodywork,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-power-converter/,Jake Groves,2024-11-24,Car Magazine UK,"‘Cylinder deactivation for batteries.’ That’s how a new innovation in power converter technology is being billed as by Mercedes-Benz engineers working on the future development of EVs. Mayk Stelter, an engineer for Mercedes-Benz, is among a team of future thinkers investigating what could be part of the next generation of electric powertrains. Stelter’s recent focus has been battery cell management, and how power converters work within a battery pack. ‘You have several power converters in a car. Five control the car’s sensors, 12 are for the radio system and four are for the car’s EV powertrain,’ says Stelter (pictured below). ‘But a lot of them are made of very conventional technology, and almost entirely hardware-based. ‘We’d like to introduce a new software-based one. One that uses not only the magnetic field [like a conventional converter] but the electric field as well, where the transfer of energy won’t happen via an iron core and copper winding, but in a system in the near-field area with a higher frequency.’ Stelter points out that there is usually just one conventional power converter serving an electric car’s whole battery pack, with all the battery’s cell sets part of the same circuit. While simpler, Stelter points out that power management this way means the whole battery is only as good as its weakest cell pack; if one cell pack is at a lower state of charge than the rest, that means the power converter reports that as the state of charge for the whole battery. Applying a much smaller, software-led power converter to each cell pack allows much more control over the battery. ‘When you apply this technology, theoretically you can drive with one cell, even if it’s not very far for very long,’ says Stelter. But the bigger applications mean that more range could be extracted from a more acutely-managed battery pack, and there could even be a mix of chemistries applied for different driving situations. It also means that a constant voltage can be applied, even as a cell’s state of charge starts to deplete. ‘It’s kind of like cylinder deactivation 2.0.’ Stelter smiles. ‘With this we can run different cells in parallel, and we don’t care about the chemistry anymore,’ he adds, pointing to the fact that higher-density cells can be used for high-power or long-distance driving, while less dense ones could be activated for urban or slower driving situations. Battery packaging is seen as another benefit, too. ‘We can split batteries where you have high performance batteries under the seat for more space, and little round cells under your feet where there’s less space,’ says Stelter. ‘That means the design of a car can change, because the cells don’t have to be all in one flat pack under the floor.’ This tech also enables another innovation Mercedes is working on: bodywork with solar cells built in. Engineer Niels Schreuders (pictured above) points to the EQXX concept car featuring solar cells on its roof. Those cells initially worked with one power converter, but this innovation in a software-based converter enabled more solar energy to be extracted from the roof-mounted cells. ‘The power converter technology is an enable for this to work,’ says Schreuders. ‘With EQXX, the solar roof accounted for 30km of extra range – all of the energy in there helped the car go 30km further.’ The next step is what Mercedes calls ‘solar coating’ – literally covering the bodywork of the car in flexible solar cells that don’t shatter under high tensile loads like conventional ones do. ‘We can apply the solar coating to any material,’ says Schreuders as he holds a new-generation solar cell on a panel of metal, ‘as it can bend and be thrown around and I won’t be able to break it.’ And this is where Mercedes’ engineers have made some calculations for if an entire car’s bodywork was solar coated. On a mid-size SUV, like an EQE SUV, Mercedes predicts you could add around 7500 miles of range to your car per year if you live in Stuttgart; 8700 miles per year in Shanghai or 12,000 miles per year in Los Angeles – provided you keep your car clean. The power converter technology feels extremely tangible, as if it could make its way to the next generation of Mercedes-Benz EVs – likely within the next five years. Stelter believes this won’t add extra weight or cost, as the simplification of other components would outweigh (monetarily, and literally) the inclusion of more power converters. ‘I think the advantages of using this kind of power converter are much bigger and will, in the end, save the market money.’ The ‘solar coating’? That could take longer, as there are quite a few complications when it comes to productionising this technology. Even so, knowing that engineers are working on it means a solar-powered car that isn’t impractical or seen as experimental won’t be science fiction much longer.

257,Stellantis confirms plan to close Luton vans factory,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/stellantis-luton-factory-closure/,Ted Welford,2024-11-26,Car Magazine UK,"Stellantis has announced its intention to close its plant in Luton as it looks to ‘consolidate’ commercial vehicle operations to one site in the UK. The global automotive group says it has opened a ‘consultation with its employees and Trade Union partners’ as it looks to shut the former Vauxhall factory in Luton and move all commercial vehicle production to its only other UK plant in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside. Stellantis has threatened to cut UK production for some time in light of Brexit trading agreements and the government’s ZEV mandate, which means car and van makers have to sell a certain percentage of EVs from 2024, but this is the first confirmation of its plans to cut UK production, and threatens 1100 jobs at the Bedfordshire plant. The ZEV Mandate requires manufacturers to have a 22 per cent share of electric cars and 10 per cent share of new electric vans sold in 2024, otherwise they face steep fines. It has come under continued fire from the UK’s automotive industry, with rumours today (November 26) circulating that the government could relax the mandate as manufacturers struggle to sell the required percentage of EVs amid buyer hesitancy. Luton has been the home of Vauxhall and then parent company Stellantis’ commercial vehicle production, with the factory producing the Vauxhall Vivaro and related Citroen Dispatch, Fiat Scudo and Peugeot Expert mid-size vans. It’s a backtrack on Stellantis’ earlier announcement in February 2024, when the firm said it would begin making electric mid-size vans in spring 2025 alongside existing diesel vans. It now appears the plant could close by this date instead. Stellantis says it has made the decision ‘within the context of the UK’s ZEV Mandate’ and that it looks to make its plant in Ellesmere Port an ‘all-electric, sustainable vehicle hub’. The Merseyside plant previously produced the Vauxhall Astra but is now the UK’s only dedicated volume EV plant after moving to manufacture Stellantis’ compact electric vans – including the Vauxhall Combo Electric and Peugeot e-Partner. The group proposes a further £50m investment into Ellesmere Port and says it is ‘committed to acting responsibly towards its employees in Luton’. It also says it will create ‘hundreds of permanent jobs’ at Ellesmere through a relocation package. The news comes just days after Ford announced it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK in the next three years, with weak demand for electric vehicles being cited as the reason.

258,Does it work? Mini's quirky circular infotainment on test,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mini-circular-infotainment-diw/,Jake Groves,2024-11-28,Car Magazine UK,"In case you hadn’t noticed, Mini has been rather busy. A new-generation petrol and , a MASSIVE new Countryman, and a completely new model in the shape of the . All of these cars run new infotainment that uses a circular screen. The screen itself is 240mm (9.4-inches) in diameter, and its OLED display is super crisp and bright in all weather. Mini says the new Android-derived Operating System 9 tech that powers it also introduces some firsts for the brand: new ‘Experiences’ (which are, effectively, drive modes attached to color themes and specific sounds inside and out of the car), an AI-enhanced voice assistant that interacts with the driver via an animated dog character called Spike, augmented-reality tech, and a new-generation app store. Mini’s gone all in on this screen, enabling the interior design as a whole to be exceptionally clean; save for a bank of physical buttons just below it, and useful steering-wheel switches, all controls are screen-based. Similar to Tesla, even the speedometer is relegated to the top edge of the display. However, that can be counteracted by the optional head-up display, part of the Level 1 option pack (£2000 on a Cooper, £2800 on a ; it also adds keyless entry, heated seats, auto high beam, a wireless charger, and more). A cheeky move, but one we suspect many will choose. It’s quick to respond to inputs and features some slick animation, but a lot of the menu organization takes some getting used to because of the system’s myriad settings. It will frustrate in the short term, but using it does come more naturally with time. The ‘Experiences’ are twee; Timeless includes a retro speedometer like an original Austin Mini, while Go-Kart mode (Sport, really) launches with a ‘WOO HOO!’ sound effect. Cringe. The snag is the insistence on having a Mini ID for full access; the voice assistant is limited without it, and even the super-handy swipe-up shortcut list for keeping your most frequently used settings needs it. The surprise bonus is the AirConsole program, downloadable via the car’s app store. It’s basically a platform for games for you to play (particularly beneficial if you’re charging an EV), where you use your phone as a controller. It’s very quick to set up and get playing, and there are games for all ages and interests. Want full access to all of the car’s systems? Better sign up for a Mini ID account – doing so boosts the functionality, including the AI voice assistant and digital key. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included and work without a hitch. But it’s amusing that the system is inset in a square on the screen. Adding the AirConsole app to the system is recommended for entertainment while parked – especially useful for EV users.

259,"ZEV mandate has ‘fundamentally changed’ car industry, says MG",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mg/zev/,Ted Welford,2024-11-29,Car Magazine UK,"The government’s has caused a ‘fundamental shift’ to the UK’s automotive market and has led manufacturers to do ‘whatever they can’ to achieve targets. Commercial director at MG Motor UK, Guy Pigounakis, spoke frankly about the mandate completely changing the way cars are sold in the UK as many manufacturers scramble to achieve targets. The ZEV mandate, introduced in 2024, requires car and van manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of new EVs each year otherwise they face steep fines unless they can trade credits with other manufacturers with surplus EVs. In 2024, firms are required to sell 22 per cent of electric cars and 10 per cent of electric vans, with some firms well on track to achieve or exceed the target, while others that currently sell few or no EVs languish far behind and face tough business decisions. Pigounakis said: ‘In my lengthy career I’ve never seen a piece of legislation fundamentally change the way manufacturers design and engineer cars, bring cars to market, even down to pricing and distribution. It’s fundamentally changed the whole industry, and will carry on doing so if the ZEV mandate continues.’ While the government announced earlier this week that they would review the ZEV mandate, the MG boss said he ‘found it hard to believe the government is going to do a complete U-turn’ and he expects it ‘won’t change to any great extent’. MG is one of those car firms in the clear, having a year-to-date EV sales mix of 27 per cent, helped mainly by the MG4, the UK’s third most popular electric car in 2024. The firm is also confident it can meet the mandate in future years, even without any changes. Despite this, Pigoukanis, a Rover veteran who then worked as sales director at Hyundai for 19 years, said: ‘I do have sympathy for other manufacturers that have invested in other technologies [hybrid] and are now very disadvantaged in the UK.” While EV sales are up 14.8 per cent year-to-date overall, and the current overall EV mix is 18.1 per cent, Pigounakis said that ‘like all averages, you need to look at the extremes and they are stark’. The MG director also said closer inspection was needed to establish where EV growth is coming from. While EV sales have grown by around 38,000 units so far year-to-date, this hasn’t been fuelled by usual retail sales and fleet channels. “Growth in EVs this year is driven by Motability, driven by demos and in the main by manufacturers own registrations, and this is driven entirely by manufacturers doing whatever they can to hit the ZEV mandate they have.” According to data seen by CAR Magazine, 25,500 more EVs have been sold on Motability this year than in 2023. Pigoukanis said: ‘Motability has now decided they have too many EVs, and it’s making it very expensive for manufacturers to put electric cars on its fleet. That is not the channel it was. ‘There’s a very high rejection level amongst electric cars on Motability, and that’s down to the pressure manufacturers have put on their dealers to sell electric cars, so if a Motability customer comes in wanting a car, they’ve been talked into an EV that doesn’t suit their needs.’ Pigounakis also said 2024 had also been a year where manufacturers had ‘too many cars’ and ‘not enough customers’. ‘I think every manufacturer now has far more cars than they’ve got customers for. So this massive turnaround in supply and availability has really developed over the last 14-15 months. ‘This year has also seen brutal discounting. This discounting is particularly prevalent in EV market, driven by oversupply and reduced demand as manufacturers scramble around to try and hit their ZEV mandate targets. Too many cars, not enough customers, and manufacturers trying to fix that with more aggressive and expensive consumer incentives in the marketplace. This situation of having more cars than customers isn’t going to go away.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
260,The Final Edition is Toyota's 429bhp farewell to the Supra,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/supra-final-edition/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-11-29,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota is waving goodbye to its with not one – but two – enhanced models. Called the A90 Final Edition and the Lightweight EVO, the duo act as a punchy full-stop to the most iconic Toyota car in a while, and also serve to celebrate its success in motorsport. First up is the Final Edition, which Toyota says is the ultimate expression of the Supra’s front-engined, rear-wheeled DNA. As you’d expect, one of the most modified new cars on the road today leaves the Toyota factory looking very different to the standard car. Toyota’s Cologne-based TGR-E motorsport division has made its mark, with a racing-inspired front spoiler, canards and front centre flap – all made of carbonfibre. At the rear, it gets a huge wind tunnel-tested swan neck wing to optimise aero balance and make this Supra look like a GT4 car. There have been changes to the powertrain too; the air intake path has been further streamlined resulting in a decent bump in power: it’s up from 335bhp to 429bhp and torque is up from 369ft lbs to 420ft lbs. Top speed has also climbed to 168mph and the powertrain is finished off with a Akrapovič titanium muffler. Heat rejection has been improved to deal with the extra power, so the radiator cooling has been strengthened and joined by a sub-radiator, and the cooling fins on the differential have grown. Oh, and the Final Edition takes the Supra’s six-speed manual transmission for ultimate driving engagement. But it’s not all power. The chassis has been upgraded with similar bits to the GT4 race car, and now uses KW components and an adjusted camber. Steering has beed electronically tweaked for a more direct feel and the entire chassis has been stiffened, with a crossbar in the boot, strengthened stabilisers all round and the same rear subframe mount as the GT4 car. Brakes are now Brembo-badged with drilled floating discs front and rear. It’ll ride on 10mm wider Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres than standard, with 19-inch rims at the front and 20-inch rims at the rear. The Final Edition gets higher friction coefficient brake pads, with drilled floating discs front and rear. Inside you get full Recaro bucket seats with red seat belts, carbonfibre scuff plates and a healthy amount of Alcantara. Like the , the driver also gets a red seat while the passenger gets a black one. Just 300 will be made. The Final Edition is joined by the non-limited Lightweight Evo, which unsurprisingly offersa more nimble version of the usual Supra formula. It’s not clear whether it’s lighter than the standard car – and instead appears to be a ‘lite’ edition of the Final Edition above. To that end it also gets larger brakes discs and different camber angles, and a tweaked chassis and suspension. The shock absorbers remain electronically controlled, but here they’re tweaked via software. So is the steering. Like the Final Edition, the whole car has been stiffened too, but with an under-body brace rather than the full metal-in-the-boot treatment. The Lightweight Evo doesn’t get to wear the full-fat bodykit like the Final Edition, but it does receive a more subtle carbonfibre ducktail rear spoiler along with new front wheel arch flaps. It runs on all-new 19-inch matte black wheels, and inside it gets a few flourishes: the drive’s seat gets the Alcantara treatment, while there’s red stitching and highlights all around – and red seatbelts too. Both models will be available to order in January next year. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

261,New Jaguar cannot work. Can it?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/jaguar/new-jag-can-t-work-can-it/,Ben Miller,2024-11-29,Car Magazine UK,"Old Jaguar is all but gone. Production of the XE, XF and F-Type , and the i-Pace and E-Pace go the same way soon, leaving the in production into early 2025 as likely the last ever Jaguar with an engine. When it goes, the curtain will fall on a chapter that, by JLR’s own admission, didn’t work. ‘The last 25 years of playing the volume premium sector – it’s not been commercially successful. If anything, it actually started to tarnish the brand,’ Jaguar managing director Rawdon Glover tells , matter-of-factly. New Jaguar is . From scratch, JLR will build an brand selling cars at six-figure prices. The powertrain is all-new. (Not for new Jaguar an easier solution like Aston’s ) The brand positioning is all-new. The client experience, we’re told, will be all-new. The plan was agreed in 2021, and the first car, , goes on sale in 2026 – so in just five years, Jaguar will go from selling mainstream SUVs and saloons through conventional dealerships to being a more affordable electric Bentley, interacting with a discerning client base via boutique spaces and a luxury digital experience. And new Jaguar will succeed where others have either struggled (Lucid) or delayed (Aston). Where to start… Jaguar undoubtedly has history, but its brand equity evidently didn’t help it sell cars to people spending £50k, let alone those spending £120k or more. If there’s hope in the notion that the luxury EV market beneath Rolls-Royce but above the volume players is relatively immature, the i-Pace – albeit at a lower price point – is a sobering reminder that going early is no guarantee of success, nor that a good car will sell. And while new Jaguar is free to describe itself as luxury until it’s blue in the face, ultimately, whether or not it gets to enjoy the trappings of being regarded as such is beyond its control. There may be some comfort in the fact that the moonshot doesn’t include beating everything out there on technology. The ballpark numbers for the 2026 GT and the JEA platform on which it’ll sit are not remarkable, despite so-called ‘gen 2.0 technology’: ‘more power than any previous Jaguar’ and a 430-mile range. The claims 481 miles; , more than 500. Glover: ‘People won’t be buying our GT because it’s electric. The reason you’re going to buy it is because it’s a stunning piece of vehicle design inside and out and you want it.’ Reasons to be optimistic are few – there are three or four, perhaps – but chief creative officer Gerry McGovern’s track record is undoubtedly one of them. His transformation of Land Rover has been extraordinary. He has sparked remarkable success through his flair and determination as a visionary, a brand custodian, and a designer; in the age-old battle of design versus engineering and cost, McGovern rarely retreats. Arriving back at Land Rover in 2004, the work that followed – two Evoques, two generations of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, and the Defender – has gilded Land Rover’s cars with a level of desirability that has transformed its pricing power. You can no longer buy a Range Rover for less than £100,000. Average transactional values are £78,430 for the Defender 110, £134,395 for the Range Rover, and £187,249 for the Range Rover SV. There may be no better-qualified person on the planet for the task Jaguar faces than McGovern. Numbers two and three? Glover says JLR is in this for the long haul, with a plan that stretches into the next decade. And while the push upmarket brings with it nowhere to hide when it comes to the owner experience, it will at least put new Jaguar out of reach of China – for now. ‘The decision of whether to retire the Jaguar brand and start over or continue with it pre-dates me, but I can only assume it was on the table and we rejected it,’ says Glover. ‘Whether you’re Polestar or any of the Chinese brands, they can’t create provenance. They can’t create history. Why would we throw all that away? We’ll be selling significantly fewer cars than the likes of Polestar, and we’re not going to do the full line-up, from A1 right through to A8. We tried that and it didn’t work. Everything I see about the way in which things are changing validates our decision to go to the elevated price point. You don’t want to be up against China with the car as a commodity.’ And the third? The passion of Jaguar’s people. Glover adores Jaguar. UK brand director Santino Pietrosanti adores Jaguar so much he has a Jaguar tattoo. If passion begets success, new Jaguar will be just fine.

262,Toyota confirms the return of the Celica,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/toyota/celica-returns/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-11-29,Car Magazine UK,"SEGA rally fans rejoice! Toyota has confirmed it’ll soon remake the iconic Celica GT-Four. The news broke during a fan event at Rally Japan, in a Q&A session with Toyota’s top brass. Some brave soul in the crowd asked Akio Toyoda (the company’s chairman of the board of directors) whether a new Celica was on the way, to which he said: ‘I can’t answer that – but there’s an executive here, so I’ll ask him.’ The executive in question was Yuki Nakajimi, Toyota’s executive vice president of product. He said, rather bluntly, ‘we’re doing the Celica.’ Which is about as solid as evidence gets. Why can’t all car manufacturers be so open about their product plans? Toyota hasn’t confirmed that yet, but we very much doubt it’ll powered by electricity. That’s because, in summer 2024, Mazda, Subaru and Toyota released a joint statement in which they announced they’d all build a new generation of cleaner combustion engines. Toyota is currently developing a pair of 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol units (the 2.0-litre is pictured below). They’re smaller, lighter and more efficient than the brand’s current engines – and they’ve both been designed to work with hybrid assistance. Crucially for the Celica project, though, neither engine is tied to hybrid power. We also know the 2.0-litre engine was designed for a broad range of high-output applications, from heavy-duty trucks to sports cars. What’s more, Toyota has confirmed it’ll have much more poke than its current 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine. When it’s teamed with a turbocharger, it could kick out as much as 400bhp. As for the drivetrain, Toyota already has already designed a fantastic four-wheel drive system for the , so it should just be a simple case of mating the new engine to this existing running gear and then dropping it into a swoopy coupe bodyshell. And, as luck would have it, the firm has already done just that. Well, sort of. For SEMA 2024, (pictured below) that had more than a passing resemblance to the 1990s Celica GT-Four rally hotshot. It even wore its grandfather’s race livery. Granted, that concept also used the Corolla’s 1.6-litre three-cylinder engine – but it also used its four-wheel drive system, which is something the the GR86’s platform was never designed to accept. So, if Toyota can manage that, packaging everything into a car that was designed to accept a four-wheel drive system on the drawing board should be a walk in the park. Exciting times lie ahead.

263,Clash at the top of Stellantis: the real reason why CEO Carlos Tavares quit,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/stellantis/ceo-carlos-taveres-quits-december-2024/,Nick Gibbs,2024-12-02,Car Magazine UK,"Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has quit suddenly after a boardroom dispute at one of the world’s biggest car-making groups. He had earlier announced his , but he left with immediate effect at the weekend a year earlier than planned. He founded and led the car super-group that comprises Fiat, Vauxhall, Jeep, Peugeot, Citroen and Chrysler since its inception in 2021 and gained a reputation as a scale and cost-focused leader. One of his final moves last week was to announce plans to close Vauxhall’s Luton van-making plant, putting 1100 jobs at risk in the UK. Senior independent director Henri de Castries revealed there had been a disagreement over strategy at the very top of the company. ‘Stellantis’s success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the board and the chief executive,’ he told reporters. ‘However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the chief executive coming to today’s decision.’ America lifted Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares to prominence, but in a cruel twist of fate the country could also be responsible for the downfall of an executive who will be remembered for stitching together 14 brands, many of them financially shaky, into an automotive powerhouse. Stuttering sales in North America this year forced the company to issue a humiliating warning to investors in late September that it would deliver 200,000 fewer cars there this year than planned. So crucial are US sales of Jeep SUVs and Ram pick-ups to Stellantis’s income that the company downgraded its predicted profit margin for the full year to between 5.5 and 7.0 per cent, from 13 per cent last year. For a company that measures success on profit margins rather than sales volumes or revenue, the adjustment was devastating. The fallout was immediate. Head of US operations Carlos Zarlenga was ousted, along with global chief financial officer Natalie Knight and the head of Europe, Uwe Hochgeschurtz. Tavares kept his position but the company announced he would leave when his current contract expires in 2026. The decision was his, ‘after listening carefully to my wife, my kids’, he told journalists at the 2024 Tavares blamed a poor second-quarter marketing plan for not driving enough customers to the company’s 2500 dealers in the US. His management style is hands-off enough to justify axing Zarlenga’s job while keeping his own. ‘The marketing plan that failed was proposed and decided by the region,’ he said in Paris. ‘I saw that it was risky. I could have stopped it. I didn’t.’ The sales downgrade in the US is the more painful given Tavares’s positive experience there, serving as president of Nissan North America from 2009. ‘He cut his teeth in America. His success there is what made him,’ said Andy Palmer, who worked alongside Tavares at Nissan under Carlos Ghosn. Like Ghosn – dubbed – Tavares worked to relentlessly chip away at encrusted fixed costs until the underlying profitability is revealed. That was his modus operandi when he jumped ship in 2014 to take over as CEO of PSA Peugeot-Citroën and again when he added Vauxhall/Opel in 2017 after buying it from GM. Merging PSA with FCA Fiat-Chrysler to create Stellantis in 2021 was the culmination of Tavares’s desire to streamline production and development by sharing parts and assembly lines, while still keeping the brands distinct. As Ghosn also found out, powerful forces are arrayed against car industry leaders who plot lean global operations with a reduced workforce and fewer plants. ‘The evidence is clear that CEO Carlos Tavares is steering Stellantis on a crash course that will cause our members tremendous harm,’ the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the US thundered late in September, claiming Stellantis was reneging on previous commitments and planning to lay off workers amid reduced production. Rivals are sniffing the blood in the water. ‘You can’t cut your way to growth, no way,’ GM president Mark Reuss told investors recently in a remark almost certainly aimed at Stellantis. Like most European car makers, Stellantis has yet to crack the code on EV cost parity with combustion engine cars. Shifting regulations also screw up planning and add cost, which of course Tavares hates. ‘Carlos is the most consistent guy I know,’ said Jean-Philippe Imparato, the outgoing CEO of Alfa Romeo, new head of Europe and a potential candidate to take over from Tavares. Consistency in good times, however, can seem like intractability in bad. Tavares’s answer to shrinking profits is more cost cutting and management reshuffling, with 21 senior management changes in the last 12 months, according to sums by analysts at Bernstein. It’s ironic that the next casualty turned out to be Tavares himself. He leaves behind a reputation as perhaps the most tenacious car executive in the toughest automotive era.

264,Thunder Cat: Ford Puma Gen-E launched with 234-mile range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/puma-electric/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-12-03,Car Magazine UK,"It’s finally here. After more than a year of , the new Ford Puma Gen-E has hit the market. It’s the latest step in Ford’s bold electrification strategy, following hot on the heels of the controversial , that’ll see the brand go all-electric by 2030. Unlike Ford’s most recent electric cars, the Puma EV is completely homegrown. The Capri and the Explorer both use a reworked version of the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, but the electric Puma is built on an updated version of the petrol car’s platform. So, there’s a chance it’ll still drive like a Ford should. Ford started by junking the Puma’s 1.0-litre petrol engines in favour of a 165bhp electric motor. And, because the motor powers the same wheels and occupies the same amount of space as the petrol engine, there’s no impact on the Puma’s packaging. It has had an impact on performance, though. The Puma EV can sprint from 0–62mph in eight seconds flat, which is only 0.6 seconds behind the petrol-powered Puma ST. There’s a chance we’ll get a spicy ST version of the EV, too. We chatted to Murat Güler, lead designer for the Puma EV – and he told us: ‘Again, that’s something I cannot talk about. You know how limited we are there. ‘But yeah, we have an ST on the ICE currently still, so that could be an option one day hopefully. Let’s get this on the road first and get it nice and successful, hopefully, and then we see what other options we have.’ That’s covert marketing speak for ‘it’s happening.’ Ford had to be a little more intelligent about where it mounted the Puma’s battery. Because the B-car platform was never really designed with electrification in mind, Ford’s engineers couldn’t place the battery under the floor (like the Mustang Mach-E, Capri, Explorer and basically every other electric car to hit the market in the last five years). Instead, they carved out some space under the rear seats and stuck the battery there. As a result, it’s not very big. It only has a usable capacity of 43kWh, which Ford says is enough for a maximum driving range of 234 miles. However, Ford also says this is an EV designed for the town – so it’s confident that limited range won’t be such a massive issue. There are a couple of benefits to having a small battery, too. Firstly, charge times are fast. Connect the car up to a 100kW DC rapid charger and you’ll be able to thrash the battery from 10–80% capacity in just 23 minutes. A smaller battery means less weight, too. In fact, the Puma EV weighs just 1563kg – and that’s only 247kg more than the standard car. The styling for starters. Ford has swapped the petrol car’s open grille for a blanked-off front end to improve the Puma’s aerodynamics. But, so the EV doesn’t look like it’s had its mouth stitched shut in some kind of cruel torture incident, there’s an outline of where the grille used to be. Mürat Guler, Ford’s lead designer for the Capri and Puma EV, explained the process to me – and it wasn’t as straightforward as you’d think. He said: ‘at one point we almost overcooked it because we removed a lot of the elements. Some of those black graphics in the grille. But then it looked so bland, you know. It had no face. And then we thought – okay, this is too much. We have to go back and introduce some of the graphical elements of the car.’ A happy side effect of the new electric powertrain is that the Puma now has more space inside. Ford has redesigned the EV’s floor to compensate for its lack of an exhaust or gearbox – and that means the rear floor is almost completely flat. That’s liberated some more foot space for those in the back. The EV’s boot is also a lot bigger thanks to its larger Megabox. It’s so much larger, in fact, that Ford has renamed it the Gigabox. Because there’s now no exhaust to dodge, the EV’s underfloor storage bin spans the width of the boot floor, bumping up maximum boot space to a simply enormous 574 litres. For context, that’s just 26 litres shy of the Skoda Octavia, which is a staggering achievement for a car that’s almost 500mm shorter. The rest of the cabin is pretty much the same as the facelifted petrol Puma. The 12.0-inch touchscreen, 12.8-inch digital gauge cluster and square steering wheel are all identical. However, the centre console is a little different, as Ford has moved the Puma EV’s gear selector onto the steering column and created a new raised section for some extra storage.

265,"Finally, an EV we can all agree on? Electrogenic electrifies the classic Mazda MX-5",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/electrogenic/mazda-mx-5-mk1-electric-conversion/,CJ Hubbard,2024-12-04,Car Magazine UK,"You can now read our . Or keep reading for the original news story. Electrogenic has developed a ‘plug and play’ conversion for the Mk1 Mazda MX-5. The British firm has already made a name for itself creating what it calls ‘drop-in’ EV powertrains for Land Rover Defenders, older Porsche 911s, the and the – now it’s amped-up perhaps the most accessible modern classic of them all. Coming at a time when the buying public and the auto industry seems to be going cold on the whole electric car bandwagon, could this be the perfect tonic to put a bit of zip back into the concept? After a duff and an apparently , can a machine as pure and simple as the original NA MX-5 put us back on the right path again? Obviously, we’re going to have to reserve judgement until we’ve driven it – which is likely to be sometime in early 2025. And at the moment there’s a glaring lack of information about the price of the MX-5 EV conversion, which could put a downer on the whole thing. But that aside there’s a lot of Good News emanating for the direction of the workshop here. To be clear, your humble scribe has previously been a serial early Mazda MX-5 owner – the last a Eunos Roadster modified with ITBs and a lot of Flyin’ Miata reinforcement – so is as likely as anyone to be dubious about an electric motor to carry through the fundamental character of this diminutive sports car. Let’s take a look at the stats. First up, the 120kW electric motor. That’s equivalent to 161bhp – a chunky boost over even 1.8-litre Mk1 MX-5s (which have, or had, roughly 130bhp) before you even get to the instant 229lb ft of torque. While there are plenty of more powerful Mk1s out there now, that should certainly be enough to keep the rear-wheel drive handling interesting. Especially since the whole car still only weighs 1100kg according to Electrogenic. That’s about 100kg more than the standard model (depending on spec), and means a 21 per cent improvement in power-to-weight. It’ll do 0-60mph ‘in around 6 seconds’, which seems entirely believable, and top speed is 115mph. No word about chassis or suspension changes to cope with the increase – probably a decision for the owner, as there’s already a lot of choice in those arenas. But thanks to Electrogenic’s proprietary Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and associated software, you do get variable driving modes and from Eco to Sport, complete with variable brake regeneration to assist the existing hydraulic friction stopping arrangement. Having completed a 3D scan of the base vehicle, Electrogenic has developed a bespoke conversion package that fits within the structure of the MX-5 in a manner that is entirely reversible. As a result there is 42kWh in brand new ‘OEM grade’ batteries positioned under the bonnet and in the area previous occupied by the fuel tank. There’s no reduction in boot space, and the batteries have been mounted as low as possible to maintain a decent centre of gravity. This is enough capacity, says Electrogenic, to offer electric MX-5 drivers 150 miles of driving range per charge. CCS rapid charging is available, and apparently means a full top-up in an hour or less. Neatly, the charging port is under the original fuel-filler flap. Well, lack of immediate pricing raises these eyebrows. Though even a relatively punchy figure won’t necessarily put MX-5 enthusiasts who want go greener off, as there are certainly pricey conventional conversions on the market – such as the , which uses a 3.0-litre Jaguar engine. Probably more of a concern is how evocative something like this can still manage to feel. Alternative upgrades – be they big-budget turbo builds, howling individual throttle bodies or more exotic cylinder configurations – all offer an extension to the already visceral early MX-5 experience. Part of our reservation here is that sadly Electrogenic has had to do away with the snicky manual gearbox, replacing it with the inevitable EV single-speed transmission. This does mean the conversion is just as suitable for old automatic models, which could be a boon if you’re after an inexpensive donor to start the project. Electrogenic says the MX-5 electrification kit has been designed so it can be completed by a trained mechanic in ‘just a few days’. Given these old Mazdas are rather like large Meccano (usually with added rust, but that’s a different problem) it seems likely many enthusiasts might be able to carry out the conversion at home. Though there is that high voltage to be mindful of. We asked whether it would be possible to use the tech on a Mk2 MX-5, since though the NB looks swoopier it’s fundamentally the same as the NA underneath. At this stage the PR team was unable to confirm if it would be compatible (we’d bet it largely is, though). Hopefully we’ll have some pricing info very soon.

266,Is cheaper car insurance on the horizon? Motorists may save £50,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/car-insurance-premiums/,Paula Cullington,2024-12-04,Car Magazine UK,"Motorists could see their insurance premiums drop next year. Thanks to a major change in how injury compensation is calculated, the introduction of a positive personal injury discount rate (PIDR) could bring some much-needed relief. The PIDR is a key factor in calculating compensation pay-outs for claimants. It considers potential investment returns on damages, ultimately affecting how much defendants are required to pay. The rate is factored into calculating the final settlement amount when determining lump sum compensation for individuals with life-altering injuries Starting 11 January 2025, a new discount rate of 0.5% will take effect, replacing the previous rate of -0.25%, thanks to improvements in the investment market. The shift to a positive discount rate could help insurers — especially those offering motor cover — by alleviating some cost pressures. But while insurers may get a breather they’re still facing significant pressure from rising costs in other areas of the industry, like labour and raw materials. The rate change is expected to spark increased competition among insurers, with PwC analysis suggesting premiums could decrease by an average of £50. According to a report from , Mohammad Khan, head of general insurance at PwC UK, commented on the positive impact of the change in the discount rate, saying: ‘This change is good news for drivers as it will further intensify the competitiveness of the motor insurance market. ‘Motor insurance premiums have risen by over 20% over the last two years, but the direction of travel has been turning and these amounts are starting to reduce.’ This change will be a welcome relief for motorists who have faced steep insurance premiums over the past year, with the average premium standing at £612. In announcing the new rate, the government’s Lord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood commented: ‘I’ve carefully considered the need to strike a balance between avoiding significant under-compensation for claimants while also preventing excessive over-compensation.’ She added, ‘Finding the right balance across all claimants is a complex and challenging task, and the expert input from the consultees in this review has been invaluable.’ ‘It is very important to recognise that the personal injury discount rate will always be a relatively blunt instrument, since no one choice of rate can ever ensure that all claimants receive exactly their full compensation.’ The PIDR in England and Wales is reviewed every five years.

It’s mostly tech and design upgrades for the Korean luxury SUV, which is part of the lineup of the brand in the UK and Europe, as well as further afield. It’s a cleaner look all round, with some neat if subtle rearranging of the car’s overall design. New wheel designs feature, as does an updated grille and the introduction of ‘micro lens array’ technology in the headlights for more detailed adaptive high beam functionality. The tech inside gets an upgrade, too, including a new-generation infotainment system from the wider Hyundai Group that spans across a massive, single-panel 27-inch display that incorporates both the driver’s instruments and infotainment display. Genesis also boasts new mood lighting, too. And… that’s about it. Performance specs are assumed to be the same post-facelift, meaning E-GMP under the skin using a 77.4kWh battery pack and 800-volt electronics for speedy 350kW charging speed potential.

Called the GMR-001 Hypercar, it’ll enter WEC in 2026 and then IMSA the following year. It’s designed to win – obviously – but also to embody the brand’s mission statement, ‘Athletic Elegance.’ If the wasn’t clear enough, now you know; Genesis wants to be a sporty brand as well as luxurious one. It does! Although just shown in render form, the GMR-001 looks like a proper racing car – but still carries the hallmarks of a Genesis product. With that in mind it features double-stacked headlights that wrap around the front corners of the car, and a double light bar at the rear. Just like the production cars. It’ll race under a newly-created Magma Racing entity, which chief creative officer Luc Donckerwolke says, ‘seamlessly blends innovation with cultural authenticity, symbolising the brand’s distinctly Korean identity and its bold entry into motorsport.’ It’ll be driven by Luis ‘Pipo’ Derani and all-round motorsport veteran André Lotterer, but there’ll also be an LMP2 ELMS team to scope out and develop further talent. Genesis has opted to enter via the lower cost LMDh entry, which limits technical freedom but also limits the bill at the end of the season. It’s the same formula Porsche has pursued. ‘This entry into motorsport is a natural evolution for Genesis,’ said Donckerwolke. ‘As we look to push the boundaries of our brand, motorsport allows us to bring the spirit of hyperspeed — which drives how we create and innovate — in a way that aligns perfectly with our core values: Audacious, Progressive, and Distinctly Korean.’ Earlier this year paddock rumours suggested Hyundai would be the brand to enter endurance racing, and it’s easy to see why: Its N division and rally success makes it no stranger to motorsport fans and it’s got the right expertise in place too. Instead, the Hyundai brand will be heavily supporting the Genesis entry; ex-Renault F1 team principal and current president of Hyundai Motorsport Cyrile Abiteboul will also be team principial of Genesis Magma Racing. Genesis will also look to help from the famous Oreca and IDEC teams too and will set up base in Paul Ricard next to both of them. ‘As the backbone of Hyundai Motor Group’s global motorsport activities, Hyundai Motorsport will play a vital role in this latest ambitious program,’ he said. ‘We are elevating our circuit racing expertise to a whole new level as we prepare to compete in some of the world’s most challenging series.’ The LMDh class is a relatively new category in prototype sports car racing, having only arrived on the circuit last year. Unlike in the LMH class, with which LMDh runs parallel at the top of the endurance racing pyramid, all LMDh car must use a set of standardised parts from a collective bin, and so the new Genesis machine will share internals with some of its competitors. Its monocoque, suspension and several other components will be taken from an LMP2 car, built by one of a handful of licenced constructors. Its hybrid system will also be a standardised unit, leaving principally the ICE unit and the car’s exterior design down to the manufacturer. LMH class manufactures, meanwhile, are essentially given carte blanche to design their prototype racers from the ground up. Despite the higher degree of standardisation in LMDh cars, certain regulations apply across both classes to ensure a similar amount of performance throughout the field. Both LMH and LMDh cars must adhere to a maximum power limit, for example, while the same minimum weight figure applies to both types of car. As the LMDh class offers a cheaper way in to the WEC than LMH, a large pool of factory teams now compete in the category. Genesis will have to shirk off the likes of Porsche, BMW, Cadillac and Alpine if it wants to enjoy any success in this league – a tough ask, given the racing pedigree of those names. Just ask Lamborghini, who has since paused its motorsport program.

269,Project V: Caterham will use immersion-tech batteries and Yamaha power for its new EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/caterham/project-v/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-12-09,Car Magazine UK,"The Caterham Project V has taken another step towards production with the announcement of Xing Mobility as the supplier of its battery technology. This follows the news earlier in 2024 that Caterham Cars is using Yamaha e-axle technology to provide the driving force. A working prototype of the Project V coupe is set to completed in 2025, with development assisted by both Yamaha and Tokyo R&D Co. Ltd. Caterham is owned by Japanese automotive group VT Holdings, and the Project V is set to make its next public appearance at the in January. Xing Mobility are a Taiwanese firm, founded by ‘veterans’ (as the corporate website puts it) of Tesla and Panasonic. It’s a lithium ion battery pack manufacturer, pioneering immersion cooling technology that it calls Immersio Cell-to-Pack. This places the battery cells inside a dielectric liquid, creating an environment of increased safety and ‘top-class’ energy density by enabling rapid and uniform heat-dissipation. If you want to build an electric sportscar that properly relates to Caterham long-standing ethos of lightweight performance, getting as much energy as possible from as little weight as possible is a pretty good idea. That said, the claimed 200 watt hours per kilogram (wh/kg) of the Immersio technology isn’t high, even by current standards. Tesla, for example, is reputedly close to 300wh/kg already. We’re therefore intrigued to see how the Caterham Project V will continue to develop. There are other lightweight sporting EVs on the horizon, including the . ‘The collaboration with Yamaha will not only deliver a powertrain to match the expectations of what an all-new Caterham should be, but confidently accelerate the delivery of Project V to the market,’ says Caterham in a statement in October 2024. Caterham Cars CEO, Bob Laishley, told CAR at the : ‘We want this in production in 2026. ‘Project V is not just a concept or design study, we’ve conducted engineering and production feasibility throughout the development process,’ Laishley adds. ‘Project V fulfils our ambition to sustainably grow the company and explore electrification simultaneously. Subject to the next phases of development and technical capability, Project V could be brought to market towards the end of 2025 or early 2026 with a target price starting from less than £80,000.’ A car from Caterham that doesn’t look how you expect it to. The Project V concept, as it’s currently named, features an enclosed roof and wheels as well as an . The is our first look at what Caterham could (and might need to) look like in a post-electrified world. While the Project V doesn’t look like a traditional Caterham, the brand says it promises to keep to the values of the company. ‘A Caterham Seven’s design is simple and minimalist, it’s designed for its intended function, to be lightweight and fun to drive,’ said the brand’s new chief designer Anthony Jannarelly. ‘With Project V, we’re applying this philosophy to the sports coupé architecture to create a seducing and timeless silhouette. Every single feature has to justify itself from a weight perspective to maintain lightness and optimise driver engagement.’ For that reason, the Project V’s silhouette has been determined exclusively by what’s underneath. The result is a car with flowing lines, and minimal overhangs and a face not unlike its designer’s own creation, the There are flourishes of design around the car, with Caterham’s chief designer also tapping into aspects of the old Lotus Elan. Kazuho Takahashi, president and CEO of VT Holdings and Caterham’s owner, has a soft spot for the old British sports car. The Project V concept debuted in 2023 with a 200kW motor on the rear axle and pairs it with a 55KWh battery. The 0-62mph takes 4.5 seconds before a top speed of 143mph, and Caterham engineers have targeted a WLTP range of 249miles. Charging from 20 to 80 per cent should take just 15 minutes provided you have a 150kW charger, and it’s also possible to have the Caterham in a 2+1 or 2+2 configuration. The crucial figure here is the weight; Caterham has targeted a kerb weight of 1190kg, making it one of the lightest EVs on the market. That featherweight figure has been achieved with a carbonfibre and aluminium composite chassis. After reveal, the Caterham Project V has been undergoing feasibility studies, as the brand weighs up and formulates a business case for the new lightweight EV. Cost-saving has been considered even in the concept, but there will now be an even greater focus on making the car as easy to to produce as possible. As well as including a Yamaha ‘e-Axle’, Caterham says the production version of the Project V will include ‘vehicle motion technology’ from Yamaha. Caterham’s new chief designer will also play a key role in the road to production: ‘I’m like a custodian of the shape,’ Jannarelly told CAR at Goodwood. ‘I need to make sure this shape will go into production.’ ‘You will see some slight change on the back edge, for example. I have to make everything which we [do] is close to what we show today. That’s key because otherwise people will say it’s not the car we saw two years ago [when it goes to production]. So that’s always a challenge.’ The Project V real and on sale in 2026 – an extremely short timeline from sketch to road – but Laishley is confident it’s achievable. And that’s partly down to Caterham’s size: ‘Based on my experience working with a big OEM, Caterham is much more agile,’ Laishley admits. ‘Decisions can be made much much quicker implemented faster. So the infotainment system: we just decided it’s iPhone mirroring. We can make that bold decision, at the bigger OEM the discussion will be well, we need our own embedded system because we can’t rely on that.’ ‘Project V isn’t instead of Seven, it’s complimentary to it, and we believe that by retaining the core Caterham values, it will appeal to both our existing customer base and attract new fans to the brand,’ Laishley explained. ‘By using a more practical coupé body style and by exploiting the packaging benefits of an EV, this is a car that works as well for trips to the shops, or the school run, as it does for Sunday morning sprints.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

270,F1 2024: the bizarre return of Flavio Briatore,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alpine/briatore-f1-team-return/,Edd Straw,2024-12-09,Car Magazine UK,"► The Alpine Formula 1 team has had a mixed 2024: it failed dismally in the first part of the year before a strong uptick in the last handful of races – most notably a double podium in Brazil. As a result the team finished an encouraging 6 with 65 points, despite its struggles. However, poor results were only responsible for a fraction of the negative headlines earlier in the year. The most recent is the planned at the end of next year and becoming a customer of rival brand Mercedes, part of a strategic overhaul. Since Renault’s return to F1 team ownership in 2016 after six years as an engine supplier, it has underachieved. Five-year plans, 100-race plans… its rebranding as Alpine in 2021 and repeated management changes made no difference to a team that has languished in the midfield and taken just one lucky win in Hungary in 2021. This latest overhaul is seen by many in the F1 paddock as the endgame rather than a fresh start. The key change is the most controversial. In June, Alpine announced Flavio Briatore’s return as ‘Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo’s executive advisor for the Formula 1 division’ – team boss in all but name. This was so extraordinary because Briatore’s last stint at Renault, as team principal, ended when the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix scandal was exposed. Bringing back the man who oversaw F1’s biggest race-fixing controversy, with Nelson Piquet Jnr deliberately crashing to trigger a safety car that allowed team-mate Fernando Alonso to win, was a shock. But Briatore was appointed to implement de Meo’s vision. That means closing its engine operation at its Viry-Chatillon facility outside Paris. ‘The stuff with the engine was decided already by the management of Renault and for me it’s fine,’ said Briatore in late August. ‘Our chairman decided it was fine. This was decided before I arrived in the team.’ De Meo says the team is not for sale and Briatore echoes that, insisting: ‘Luca de Meo never wants to sell the team, question finito.’ Yet there are persistent whispers that it is the plan, with 2016 F1 world champion Nico Rosberg even claiming in TV commentary that he’s been offered the chance to invest. Closing the engine programme detaches the F1 operation from Renault, making any sale more straightforward. The official reasoning is competitive pragmatism and the desire to reallocate resources at its Viry base to road-car projects. Yet the Alpine workers’ council fighting the closure of the engine programme claims ‘the stated reason is significant direct cost savings, replacing €120 million in development costs with €17 million in annual supply costs’. Alpine’s UK chassis base and the French engine facility have never been properly integrated. Each side persistently blames the other. ‘Since 2022, the power unit has accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the total performance deficit of the car,’ says the Alpine workers’ council statement. ‘The rest is due to the Enstone factory chassis, which struggles to improve amid successive leadership changes.’ The engine is roughly 25bhp down on its rivals, but the chassis started the season overweight and short of downforce. While the car is now on the weight limit it’s only good enough to pick up occasional ninth places. The common thread is Renault’s ownership. It underestimated what it takes to win in F1 and is responsible for near-constant management instability. It all points to a sale, but not necessarily a quick one, as Renault is willing to press on to F1’s new regs in 2026. A leap forward might tempt it to stay in control, and while Briatore takes care of the big picture, he’s appointed well-regarded 36-year-old Oliver Oakes as team principal. ‘Since 2022, the power unit has accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the total performance deficit of the car,’ says the Alpine workers’ council statement. ‘The rest is due to the Enstone factory chassis, which struggles to improve amid successive leadership changes.’ The engine is roughly 25bhp down on its rivals, but the chassis started the season overweight and short of downforce.

Whatever happens, Renault has a valuable asset in the growing F1 economic bubble. Last year, it sold a 24 per cent stake to a consortium of investors including Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds for €200m – and the team’s value has only risen since then. Briatore’s appointment is logical only if sale is the objective.

271,Citroen slashes prices of new electric e-C4 and e-C4 X,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/c4/,Keith Adams,2024-12-10,Car Magazine UK,"Citroen has announced pricing for its updated C4 and C4 X models, which bring tweaked styling inside and out, and a significant price cut for the electric e-C4 to make it one of the . The refreshed C4 line-up was revealed earlier in the year at the , appearing alongside the the striking and the . They’re quite involved updates with the C4, too. Citroen has dragged the cars’ styling into step with the , while tweaking their interiors, technology suites and powertrain range. Plus, the brand promises they’ll be more comfortable and convenient to own than the old models. Obviously. Or it wouldn’t have bothered. They’ll hit showrooms in early 2025, offering renewed competition for the smorgasbord of jacked-up C-segment Stellantis cars, as well as stuff like the , and . Scroll down to learn everything we know about the new car and full pricing and trim details. It’s even more comfortable. Citroen has redesigned its Advanced Comfort seats, adding an extra 15mm of foam and a new, denser section of padding in the centre of the squab. The driver’s seat has some extra height and lumbar adjustment, too. Citroen has tickled the cars’ infotainment systems, too. They have the same 10.0-inch screen as before, but they’ve been updated with a new connected 3D sat-nav system and a new digital assistant that’s activated by screaming ‘Hello Citroen’ at the dashboard. You also get a new 7.0-inch digital gauge cluster, which is 1.5 inches better than the old car’s. It looks and works much like the old car’s, but it’s a little sharper – and the extra space on the screen is a welcome improvement. Like the old car, you can have a head-up display as an optional extra. Lastly, Citroen has introduced (or ‘V2L’ if you’re one of the cool kids) on the pure-electric Citroen e-C4 and e-C4 X. It means you can now use both cars like giant, mobile power banks, siphoning the energy in their batteries to feed external appliances such as laptops, kitchen appliances or even power tools. Yep, they’re different too. You can still have the C4 with both petrol and electric powertrains – but Citroen has been fiddling with the petrol models. The old car’s non-electrically assisted petrol engines have been scrapped for two new mild hybrid units – one with 134bhp and one with 99bhp. They’re based on Citroen’s familiar 1.2-litre three-cylinder Pure Tech engine, but they’re supported by a new 28bhp 48-volt electric motor and a dinky 0.4kWh battery pack. Citroen says these electrified engines produce 20 percent less CO2 than the old, non-electrified Pure Tech C4. Plus, because that 48-volt motor is punchy enough to move the car around on its own at low speeds, the brand reckons you’ll be able to potter around town in zero-emission smug mode for 50 percent of the time. The EVs haven’t changed. As before, the e-C4 is offered with two electric powertrains. The entry-level model has a 50kWh battery pack and a 134bhp electric motor, which Citroen says gives the car a driving range of 219 miles. In 2023, Citroen introduced a longer-range version of the e-C4 – and that’s sticking around for the facelift. It has a 54kWh battery and a more efficient 154bhp electric motor that boost the car’s maximum official range to 257 miles. This hasn’t changed either. The C4 hatchback still has ample space inside for five and it still boasts the best-in-class rear legroom. Boot space remains the same at 380 litres with the rear seats in place and 1250 litres with the bench folded flat. The C4 X has the same amount of interior as its hatchback sister, but its boot is a bit roomier. You get 510 litres of boot space but, because it has a saloon boot rather than a hatchback, it’s a little less convenient to load up. The big news here is that Citroen has slashed prices of the electric e-C4 model by as much as £5,600 compared to before. Prices for the e-C4 now start from £26,295, making it the most affordable electric family hatch in this class – even undercutting the . The e-C4 X stars from £27,360. Those prices buy the entry-level 50kWh versions, with the larger 54kWh model starting from £30,150 across both hatchback and saloon derivatives. With the previous C4’s entry-level engines discontinued, prices for the ICE car have risen considerably from £19,720 to £22,295 for the mild-hybrid. The C4 X starts from £24,735. As before, the C4 line-up is available in three trims – You, Plus and Max. Standard features include new 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-inch touchscreen and dual-zone climate control. The Plus trim brings a reversing camera, 3D satellite navigation system and the new digital instrument cluster. At the top of the range, the Max model comes with heated front seats, adaptive cruise control and Citroen’s Advanced Comfort seats.

272,The Ford Mustang GTD Is the fastest American car to lap the Nurburgring,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/mustang-gtd/,Jake Groves,2024-12-10,Car Magazine UK,"The Ford Mustang GTD has set a Nurburgring record for an American car with a time of 6:57:66. Designed to topple European sports cars ‘on their own soil’, according to Ford, the Mustang GTD – a road-legal version of – is now the fifth fastest stock sports car to lap the circuit. It also achieves the mission of Ford CEO Jim Farley of having an American car lap the Nurburgring in less than seven minutes. Driven by Multimatic Motorsports driver Dirk Müller to set an officially recorded Nurburgring time, Ford says it ‘will be back’ to shave more time off the time. Jim Farley said: “The team behind Mustang GTD took what we’ve learned from decades on the track and engineered a Mustang that can compete with the world’s best supercar. “We’re proud to be the first American automaker with a car that can lap the Nürburgring in under seven minutes, but we aren’t satisfied. We know there’s much more time to find with Mustang GTD. We’ll be back.” Ahead of the ‘Mustang GTD in the lap time leaderboard are cars such as the and . The holds the overall road car record with a time of 6:35:18. Read on to find out more about Ford’s skunkworks Mustang GTD. If you’re from Europe, those three letters . But, in the case of the Mustang, GTD is an entirely motorsport-derived title. As well as links to the Mustang GT3 and GT4, the name refers to the IMSA GTD racing class. And it’s no diesel under the bonnet, either. Here, the Mustang GTD uses a bespoke 804bhp 5.2-litre supercharged V8 with a dry sump engine oil system, a 7500rpm redline and an active titanium exhaust so you hear every single bit of it roar. All of that power is sent to the rears via an eight-speed transaxle gearbox that also deploys a carbonfibre driveshaft to maintain a 50/50 front/rear weight balance. The GTD uses 20-inch forged aluminium wheels (magnesium ones are available) and huge Brembo carbon ceramic brakes are standard. Some elements of the active aerodynamics, for a start. Chief engineer, Greg Goodall, says: ‘an available aero package includes features pioneered in motorsports, as well as technology that would be illegal in certain series, such as hydraulically-controlled front flaps to manage air flow for aerodynamic balance and coordination with the active rear wing.’ And active, it seems, is the word of the day. As well as active aerodynamics, the GTD uses active suspension with variable spring rates and ride height – again, according to Holt, not allowed in racing. ‘We did some radical things,’ he says, ‘it’s got in-board suspension like a lot of prototype race cars – you press a button and 10 seconds later you’ve got a completely different characteristic on the car. The GTD showcases our state-of-the-art DSSV spool valve suspension technology, with features not even allowed in racing.’ For example, when in Track mode, the ride height can lower by 40mm. Elsewhere, Ford says it uses some clever bits in the GTD’s interior including Miko suede in the seat upholstery and 3D-printed titanium paddle shifters that are recycled from retired F22 Raptors. You better have deep pockets, and already be a friend of Ford. Jim Owens, the Mustang’s consumer marketing manager, says that the Mustang GTD will be a limited-run model, and the brand will use an application process ‘similar to that of the Ford GT’ to discern who gets one. The GTD will come to the UK, albeit in very limited numbers, and with prices starting from an eye-watering £315,000.

273,Callum Design Skye: new interior pictures of luxury EV off-roader,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/callum/skye/,Jake Groves,2024-12-11,Car Magazine UK,"Ian Callum and his team at Callum Design have created a new project: the Skye. As you can see from the pictures, the Skye is a radical-looking electric off-roader that Callum Design claims is meant to be ‘the world’s most beautiful, high-performance, multi-terrain vehicle.’ In case you need your memory jogging, Callum Design is a design house headed up by influential British automotive designer, Ian Callum. Callum is most famous for designing cars like the Aston Martin Vanquish and plenty of models in Jaguar’s 21 century portfolio including the last XK, F-Type, and F-Pace and I-Pace among many others. At Callum Design, he had another go at the Vanquish with the that Callum Design kicked off with. Other projects include , as well as more off-the-wall ones like designing a cocktail mixed and a lounge chair. Yeah, we have no idea why either. It’s a project that’s been entirely conceived within Callum Design as a high-performance, lightweight 2+2 off-roading… thing. The Skye promises ‘sports car performance’ and a low weight of 1150kg. ‘The exterior features a striking accent loop, intersected by a strong horizontal structure, flanked by organic forms front and rear,’ says Ian Callum. ‘At the heart of its story is its performance, style and capability, and a design integral to the engineering elements.’ To help with keeping it light, the Skye uses a carbonfibre space frame chassis and what looks to be as little bodywork as possible. As for its electric performance, there’s a 42kWh battery pack enough power for a four-second 0-60mph time. Callum Design claims a range of 170 miles. In order to make it capable off road, the Skye also features all-wheel drive (meaning at least two motors will be deployed) and tough ‘trail-capable’ suspension and off-road tyres in certain specifications. Callum Design has revealed new pictures of the inside too, and it sticks to the same funky minimalist style of the exterior. It’s certainly an interior befitting of a buggy but it’s designed to be premium too. ‘While the Callum Skye is capable and has a rugged exterior, the interior design is carefully and considerately refined to deliver a premium feel at every touchpoint,’ said Aleck Jones, the brand’s head of design. ‘Clever design solutions keep the interior simple but not simplistic, giving it a light, airy and refined feel while being within a compact cabin. Its success is down to its careful balance of opposing factors, baked into an exterior that people understand and enjoy.’ It’s also lightweight too, with the weight being a key target throughout the car. That meant that certain materials were chosen both for their luxurious feel, but also their performance on the scales: ‘We’ve had challenging weight targets to achieve, so we’ve utilised lightweight solutions where possible without compromising on the luxury feel,’said the brand’s colour, material and finish designer, Charlotte Jones. ‘Inside, the bright silver, premium metallic coated finish on the doors, dash and centre console matches the CALLUM level of quality in our recent Jaguar C-X75 project while saving essential weight.’ According to Callum Design, the Skye is planning to make production. The Skye is undergoing prototype testing as we speak, with the aim to release proper production-spec specifications for on and off-road versions early in 2024 ready for punters to order one. Callum’s colour, material and finish designer, Charlotte Jones has also hinted at what some of the car could be made of: ‘Additionally, this prototype features body panels made from flax composite with bio-resin, which is being explored as a potential option for production models,’ she said.

274,Toyota Urban Cruiser: the new face of Toyota EVs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/urban-cruiser/,Graham King,2024-12-12,Car Magazine UK,"This is the new all-electric Toyota Urban Cruiser. It’s the Japanese brand’s contender in the rapidly growing small sector where it competes against the , and , plus the recently unveiled and . Developed from the seen in 2023, the Urban Cruiser is based on a new, as yet unnamed platform specific to Toyota’s coming range of electric cars – six will be launched by the end of 2026 among a total 15 zero-emission vehicles. Three powertrains will be available in the Urban Cruiser. The entry-level model comes with a 49kWh battery pack and a single motor on the front axle producing 142bhp and 139lb/ft of torque. The mid-range version has a bigger 61kWh battery and a more powerful, 172bhp motor, again driving the front wheels. Curiously, it has the same torque as the lesser motor. At the top of the range, there’s an all-wheel-drive model that retains the 61kWh battery but gains another motor on the back axle. Power output goes up to 181hp and torque to 221lb/ft. Toyota hasn’t given range figures or charging times for any of the powertrains. According to Toyota, the Urban Cruiser’s new platform liberates a lot more interior space than you get in the similarly sized . That space is all in the wheelbase, which is 140mm longer than that of the Yaris Cross. A sliding back seat with 160mm of fore and aft movement provides huge flexibility, too. Push the seat all the way back and there’s as much space as in a much bigger D-segment SUV, claims Toyota. The seat also split-folds 40:20:40 and reclines. Toyota calls the Urban Cruiser an “authentic SUV” with a “bold appearance.” The graphic at the front incorporating a blacked-out grille, angled headlights and full-width light bar – dubbed “hammerhead” – will be seen on other upcoming Toyota EVs, as well. The bodywork is stretched out over the wheels – 18- or 19-inches, depending on model – and there’s another full-width light bar at the back. Inside, the dashboard is dominated by the slab of display screens. There’s a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel and a 10.1-inch touchscreen for the infotainment that Toyota says are “seamlessly integrated.” Many driver assists are included, among them adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist and a surround-view system. A power driver’s seat, JBL stereo and panoramic glass roof will be fitted to certain models, as well. AWD models feature hill descent control and a trail mode that shuffles power from a spinning wheel to the opposite wheel. FWD models have a snow mode that reduces slip on snow-covered roads. We’ll see the Toyota Urban Cruiser in the metal for the first time at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show in January. The Urban Cruiser name was previously on sold in the UK from 2009 to 2012. It wasn’t a success, but now looks like it was a few years ahead of its time. Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"
275,DS No8 unveiled: a new beginning for the brand?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ds/no8/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-12-12,Car Magazine UK,"DS has kicked off its rejuvenation with this – the No8 saloon. It’s the brand’s new flagship model, which also happens to be the first electric-only car DS has ever built. That’s right; currently, DS has no plans to introduce a petrol-powered version of the No8, despite the fact the platform on which it’s based can accept one. At 4.82 m long, 1.90 m wide and 1.58 m tall, it’s sized to compete with the likes of the and but, from what we’ve seen of Stellantis’ current range of electric cars, it’ll have its work cut out to compete with those rivals. DS is confident in its new car’s ability, though. It’s easily one of the boldest cars from the firm’s design department and, on paper at least, it’s the most efficient EV in its line-up. That should help attract some new buyers to the brand, as should the car’s extensive range of technology and its exciting new interior design language. It’ll hit UK showrooms in mid-2025 with an expected starting price of around £50,000 (which we reckon is quite reasonable). Scroll down to learn everything there is to know about the new DS No8. The DS 8 is built on the same platform as the and Vauxhall Grandland, which means it inherits Stellantis’ latest electric motors and battery packs. The most basic No8 has a 74kWh battery pack and a single 256bhp electric motor mounted on the front axle. DS reckons that’s enough for a 0–62mph time of 7.7 seconds and a maximum range of 355 miles. But, if we learned anything from our testing of the e-3008, that latter figure is likely to be closer to 280 miles in the real world. The middling No8 has a larger 97.2kWh battery pack and a slightly more powerful 276bhp electric motor. The upgrades increase the saloon’s maximum claimed range to 466 miles but, because it’s a little heavier, its 0–62mph time is a little slower at 7.8 seconds. At the top of the No8 range is a twin-motor, all-wheel drive model. It has the same 97.2kWh battery as the mid-range car, but it gains an extra motor on the rear axle. That boosts power to 370bhp, although maximum range falls to 426 miles thanks to the additional strain the second motor is placing on the electrical system. Charge times are pretty good, too. The No8 can accept DC rapid charging speeds of up to 200kW, meaning a 20–80% charge takes just 27 minutes. That’s comparable to the speed of the ID.7’s charging system, but slightly behind the Hyundai Ioniq 5’s lightning-fast setup. Well, much like everything else DS makes, it’s rather unusual. For starters, it has a four-spoke steering wheel and some incredibly futuristic brushed metal trim on the dashboard and door cards. It’s also available in a range of unusual upholstery finishes, including a white vegan leather, a navy blue Alcantara and the ‘Light Gold’ colourway you see in the image below, which DS says is reminiscent of luxury vehicles from the 1930s. Its technology should at least be familiar to anyone who’s read our review. The No8 has the same 16.0-inch infotainment system as its chassis sibling, albeit skinned with a slightly more upmarket theme. DS says the screen was designed to work like a smartphone, with a similar menu design and a support for voice control. But, because the No8 is being pitched as a premium motor, it’s available with a lot more equipment than the Vauxhall. We’re talking a full-length panoramic sunroof, a standard heat pump, an augmented reality head-up display and a fancy stereo from the French audio specialist Focal. You can even have it with a night-vision camera. DS even says the No8 will be quite practical. It has 620-litre boot, which is 88 litres more than a Volkswagen ID.7 and a whopping 150 litres more than you get in a BMW i4. It’s fitted with the latest version of technology. We’ve already sampled the tech on the and – but we thought it was rather hit and miss in its application. The 9 was comfortable enough, but the 7 was rather unsettled. The suspension is linked to a camera at the top of the windscreen which reads the road and pre-loads each damper to compensate for any upcoming road imperfections. Plus, to help counteract the effects of pitch and dive, there are a brace of accelerometers dotted around the car, also feeding data to the dampers. DS says this will give the No8 great ride quality. DS is also quite proud of the No8’s aerodynamic efficiency. It has a drag coefficient of just 0.24Cd. That’s about the same as a – and the firm says its slippery styling accounts for around an extra 46 miles of motorway driving.

276,"Boreham Motorworks £295,000 Mk1 Ford Escort is gladly more interesting than it looks",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/boreham-motorworks-escort-mk1-rs/,CJ Hubbard,2024-12-12,Car Magazine UK,"So, this is the Ford Escort Mk1 RS. Announced just prior to the , in simple terms it’s a continuation model that follows 50 years after the last Mk1 Escort RS2000 and is built with the full blessing and approval of Ford. It looks… disarmingly undramatic. Especially for something that has a price of £295,000 and – as it turns out – quite the potential for customers to spend more. Boreham Motorworks has also chosen, probably quite deliberately provocatively, to trademark the terms ‘Continumod’ and ‘Peak Analogue’ to describe what it’s up to here. In a world increasingly stuffed with rich reimaginings of evocative classics, all of this has the potential to rather get on one’s goat. For want of a better term. Especially as the Mk1 Escort was originally much more of a car of the people than, say, the . Given just 150 will be built and you’ll clearly need to be exceptionally well-walleted to take the plunge, the whole thing seems a little too much like elitist onanism for some tastes. And yet… there is some interesting engineering involved. And what would appear to be some fairly intensive costs to the creation process. So let’s proceed with an open mind, shall we? Unlike conventional restomods – which take a classic car and update it – the Boreham Motorworks Escort does not require a donor vehicle. Instead it carries on where the original RS models’ chassis numbers left off, and is built from the ground up using totally new components. Including the bodyshell. But even the shell isn’t an off-the-shelf item (there are places in China knocking these out now; you can buy them on Alibaba). Boreham has instead used laser scanning and the original blueprints to fully reengineer it in CAD. This has enabled the creation of new jigs and assembly fixtures that will – we’re told – allow manufacturing to the same standard of flush fitment and panel gap tolerances as a truly modern car built by an OEM. You’re probably already starting to see how the Mk1 Continumod could work out so expensive… As part of this process, and in combination with the desired performance outcomes, the body structure has been enhanced to improve torsional rigidity, handling dynamics, performance and usability. Changes include additional bracing, wider inner arches and vertically position rear dampers. The body structure is all steel, but the bonnet and bootlid are carbonfibre, as are ‘all the internal substrates’. Other lightweight features include the rear axle (more on this in a moment) and the optional (so there’s a price increase already) magnesium wheels. Target weight is just 800kg. Now we’re really getting interested. Your entry-level £295k gets you an ‘iconic’ Ford Twin Cam engine. Bored-out to 1845cc and updated fuel injection it may be, but that still feels like a lot of money for four cylinders and just 183bhp. Just to really mess with our heads, it comes with a manual gearbox – albeit a straight cut ‘Ford bullet’ syncromesh item that already has our hands tingling in anticipation. There is another option, though. At as yet unspecified extra cost, you can have your Boreham Mk1 with a brand-new – but also Ford-derived – 2.1-litre four-banger that revs to 10,000rpm. Described as ‘road-optimised’ but ‘motorsport-derived’, this chain-driven double overhead cam affair is constructed from billet and cast components and weighs less than 85kg. Forged steel conrods, billet crankshaft, motorsport wiring, coil-on plug ignition and advanced fuel injection come together to achieve 296bhp – which then breathes through a titanium exhaust. It promises to sound extraordinary, as well as be very fast. Even if Boreham Motorworks rather fluffs its ‘Peak Analogue (TM)’ schtick by relying on electronic throttle control, that was probably inevitable with a modern power unit. This engine gets an extra gear, too, with a five-speed dogleg manual transmission promising ‘perfect weight and throw’, although also a slightly unusual shift pattern to dazzle and/or confuse. There are no performance figures as yet, but it’s going to feel – and be – pretty quick. In a much more visceral fashion than modern machinery, no doubt. Up front you get MacPherson struts with ‘geometry that has been optimised within the existing hardpoint envelope’. We’re told it will be responsive and grippy. At the back, as well as vertical coil-over dampers there’s an all-new ‘fully floating axle’ made from aluminium and titanium. Described as ‘offering predictable handling and a direct connection to the Escort’s motorsport heritage’ and aided by an ATB limited-slip differential, this should certainly give the Boreham Mk1 a distinct feel. The whole thing has been ‘engineered for exceptional control under power’, with the balance to breakaway and slide with predictable satisfaction. Which is good news, since there’s no power steering, no traction control, no brake servo, and – most controversially – no ABS. Modest 15×7-inch wheels at the front are paired with 15×8-inch wheels at the rear. Braking also seems minimal for a car with nearly 300bhp: 260mm vented discs and four-piston calipers at the front and 264mm solid discs with two-piston calipers at the rear. But remember it only weighs 800kg. A roll cage with removeable door bars completes the chassis package. A pretty straight-looking update at first glance, the interior nonetheless features modern four-vent air-conditioning, heated windows and what appears to be a single-DIN CarPlay capable headunit. A beautiful set of analogue dials sit behind a classic deep dish steering wheel, while the lightweight ethos is reflected in the fabric door pulls and the option of a carbonfibre helmet transport system for the rear. You get three-point inertia-reel seatbelts as standard with four-point harness available at extra cost. Well, there’s a two-year, 20,000-mile warranty – which doesn’t seem that generous, given the cost. And we should get first sight of the finished article in ‘summer’ 2025. We’d guess that means at the next Goodwood Festival of Speed. Going to be a divisive car, this one, we feel. On the one hand, good on Boreham Motorworks for offering such a thorough-seeming job. But the gentrification of the Ford Escort seems a little sad (yes, we know how much an original RS now costs, let alone anything with competition pedigree) and we do wonder what sort of market there is for something so raw and so expensive.

280,Nio’s new Firefly brand launches with iPhone-eyed EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/firefly/ev/,Jake Groves,2024-12-23,Car Magazine UK,"Nio, the Chinese car brand that focuses on autonomous tech and battery-swapping capabilities, is launching a new car brand named Firefly. The first model to launch under the Firefly brand is this new EV which has been designed to be a value-focused small electric car that seems to come designed with headlights that echo an iPhone’s camera lenses – and take inspiration from the . Technical specifications haven’t been announced yet, but Firefly says its new EV will ‘usher in the era of small, smart, high-end electric car with a key focus on design, safety, space, intelligence and energy efficiency.’ Firefly says the new model is designed to ‘raise small car safety to new standards’, promising a strong structure and the aim to clock a five-star EuroNCAP safety rating. Nio says the Firefly brand and its car will launch in China in April 2025, likely launching in Europe in the summer of the same year. In China, its priced from around £16,000 – likely meaning a good value price when it launches in Europe. We’ll updated this story when we get more information about the new Firefly electric car.

281,Renault's Safety Coach tech: does it work?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/renault-safety-coach-does-it-work-/,Jake Groves,2024-12-26,Car Magazine UK,"Want to become a better driver? Renault thinks it has the answer, introducing new tech in its latest cars designed to guide you to becoming safer on the road. Safety Coach is available on the current , , and plus the upcoming . The system has netted an innovation award from the French government. Safety Coach works very much like those onboard systems – found on almost every Renault, for example – that rate you on how efficient your driving is. How much throttle you apply, how early you anticipate the need to slow down, your coasting technique and how efficiently you change gear if you use a manual – all this and more influence your eco rating. Instead, Safety Coach measures you on speed, how close you are to cars in front and ‘trajectory management’ – keeping in your lane and not getting distracted. Worried that this all sounds very annoying? Renault provides a handy button that activates your individual preferences for the car’s safety and assistance systems. By default, everything is on whenever you get in, but the ‘My Safety’ button allows you to change all the car’s settings with the one push – easy. With Safety Coach also on board, even if you adjust or turn off some of the safety aids like lane keep, speed warning and autonomous emergency braking, Safety Coach will keep an eye on you anyway. You may be pleased to know, however, that this information never leaves the car, so those insurance premiums won’t skyrocket if your insurer sees any ropey scores. The first score of the day for us was 39 out of 100. Ouch. ‘You sometimes have a risky driving style,’ says the coach, offering guidance that boils down to ‘go slower’. As well as that total score out of 100, each of the three areas of focus – speed, following distance and trajectory – is broken down into ratings out of five. Small animations and videos brief you on how to drive more safely, advising you on certain behaviours, and gameifying safer driving. And the results are clear – our score improved, reaching as high as 79. But, just like a coach at the gym, it only offers you motivation and advice. Want to become a better driver? You still need to put in the work. Whether you like it or not, Renault’s Safety Coach watches your every move. Drive like a fool? You’ll be scored poorly, and told you have a ‘risky’ driving style – ouch. Your speed, distance from other vehicles and attentiveness to keeping in your lane are rated at all times. Want a better score? Maybe learn to relax. ‘It not worth it!’ says the Safety Coach like an extra in EastEnders if it thinks you speed regularly. It guides you to use the on-board safety tech more. Yes. It all works as you’d expect it to, but it’s there to give you surface-level guidance and nothing more. Many of us will take that light touch as a good thing if we’re, er, keen drivers.

282,Porsche saves the combustion engine! Six-stroke tech patent investigated,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/porsche-six-stroke-engine-patent/,"",2025-01-01,Car Magazine UK,"Porsche has filed patents for an engine cycle with two combustion events for every six strokes (or three rotations of the crankshaft). They call it a 2 x 3-stroke. I’d humbly suggest it’s a 4 + 2-stroke. The conventional four-stroke cycle has phases comprising induction, compression, expansion, and exhaust (with combustion occurring just before expansion). The new cycle drops a two-stroke event in, enabled by a pretty complex crankshaft arrangement that allows two different top and bottom dead centre positions during the same cycle. It now includes second compression and expansion events after the first expansion phase: the two-stroke bit. Except it’s even more complex than that… In its patent illustrations, Porsche has shown a ‘scavenging’ phase between the first expansion and second compression as the unusual crankshaft arrangement comes into play. This mechanism allows the piston to reach a ‘lower’ BDC than for the four-stroke bits of the cycle and, in so doing, uncover a belt of scavenge ports that have been lurking just out of sight. In this sense, ‘scavenging’ is a two-stroke term. Just before those ports are uncovered, the exhaust valves open, allowing some combusted gases to escape and dropping the pressure in the cylinder. When the piston opens the ports, pressurised air blows the gases upwards and through the exhaust – we call this ‘uniflow scavenging’. The exhaust valves and scavenge ports then close and the second compression occurs with ignition at TDC. This second combustion event is key. It may be that it is not about increasing power but reducing emissions by re-burning gases trapped within the cylinder. Two-strokes lend themselves to ‘homogeneous charge compression ignition’ combustion, which is efficient and clean, with no spark or flame in the normal sense. While some exhaust gases would be lost during the first exhaust event, most could be trapped and re-burned. However, you cannot allow fresh air to exit the exhaust or a simple after-treatment system won’t work, so this would limit power. I’ve no doubt the Porsche concept could be made to work. But really, why would you want to try? Because there are some disadvantages… Apart from the mechanical complexity of the crankshaft (with its hypo-cycloidal gearing – think a big Spirograph set), piston-controlled ports require effort to overcome potential ring wear, but I am sure it can be done (big marine two-strokes are uniflow-scavenge engines and are supremely reliable). Generally, with piston-controlled ports, eliminating oil consumption also requires effort. As I’ve said, not all of the gases will get re-combusted and you’ll also need boost pressure for scavenging. Plus, the camshafts now need to turn at one-third engine speed, with the exhaust valves opening twice. But why not simplify things and just build a uniflow-scavenged two-stroke? Yes, the car industry has severe prejudice against two-strokes. But this six-stroke is at least a third of the way there, and way more complex…"
283,Ford Raptor debuts on Dakar Rally: can it win?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/ranger-raptor-dakar/,Graham King,2025-01-02,Car Magazine UK,"Ford is set to make a splash on its debut in the Dakar Rally, which gets underway on 3 January in Saudi Arabia with this, the Raptor T1+. And it stands a strong chance of success, with a stellar driver line-up led by five-time Dakar winner Carlos Sainz. It’s front grille and headlights may bear a passing resemblance to those of the road-going , but the similarities end there. The Raptor T1+ is a completely bespoke machine with a spaceframe chassis that’s designed solely to contest the Dakar and other rounds of the FIA World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) in the Ultimate class. Power comes from a 5.0-litre Coyote V8 engine that’s also found in the . It produces 360bhp, which may not sound like much, but power is limited by the T1+ category regulations. Torque is more important for desert racing anyway, but even that is limited by the FIA. Power is sent to all four wheels via a six-speed sequential gearbox supplied by Sadev, and a limited-slip differential. Indeed it does. Like all the T1+ vehicles, the Raptor is a huge, heavy beast that’s contesting the automotive equivalent of Ali and Foreman’s rumble in the jungle. So the suspension has to absorb an almighty beating. The suspension is, of course, fully independent, with a massive 350mm of travel – as stipulated by the regs. There are two industrial-strength shock absorbers at each corner that are supplied by off-road racing specialist Fox, the same company that makes the Ranger Raptor’s shocks. There are four sets of double Eibach springs, as well, which are designed to compress progressively to prevent the car bottoming out after a big jump. Then there are super-trick external bypass shock absorbers that deal with really hard landings, helping to keep the car – and the driver and co-driver – in one piece. Sort of. The crews take almost as much of a pounding as their cars, but Ford has designed the Raptor to take the sting out of the ordeal. There’s air-conditioning for a start, and the interior layout was designed by Dakar veteran Nani Roma. But the crews will have to contend with the 30kg weight of the 37-inch wheel and tyre combo multiple times throughout the Dakar. Quite promising. The Ford Performance team is operated by its World Rally Championship partner M-Sport, which also designed, built and developed the Raptor. A very thorough job they did, too, even using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to test the Raptor’s aero. The car showed good speed on its debut on the Morocco round of the 2024 W2RC, but the effort was hit by technical trouble. The Dakar will quickly reveal any more gremlins but, with the campaign spread across four cars, there’s a good chance at least one will score a strong result. As mentioned earlier, Carlos Sainz acts as team leader for his third stint with the M-Sport squad – he drove their factory-backed Fords in the WRC. He won in 2024 driving for Audi and has every chance adding to his tally. Development driver Nani Roma has Dakar wins in both the bike and car categories under his belt and is sure to be fast. As is Mattias Ekstrom, who also switches from Audi. He has made clear he’s out to win the Dakar and doesn’t care how many times he has to compete to do so. Mitch Guthrie steps up to the Ultimate class in the Raptor. He may lack experience of the machinery, but there’s no doubting his speed. There is very strong competition, though. All eyes are on fellow Dakar debutante Dacia and its Prodrive-run Sandrider. The team appears to be even better prepared than Ford and won first time out in Morocco. Desert racing savant Nasser Al-Attiyah leads the Dakar attack, backed up by Sebastien Loeb – still chasing his first Dakar win – and Ultimate class first-timer Cristina Gutierrez, who won the Challenger class in 2024. Then there are the massed ranks of Toyota Hiluxes. They’re headed by factory Toyota Gazoo Racing drivers Seth Quintero and Lucas Moraes, both of them keen as mustard to take their first wins, but Yazeed Al-Rajhi will be right at the front with them his privateer Overdrive entry. The X-Raid Mini squad may face issues with its new twin-turbo petrol engine, but it has two very capable drivers in 2024’s surprise runner-up Guillaume de Mevius and hardbitten motorsport adventurer Guerlain Chicherit. The fleet of rear-wheel-drive Century and MD ‘buggies’ will be in the mix as well, and the Nissan-powered Red-Lined machines may spring the odd surprise. The Dakar begins on 3 January with the short Prologue before the first proper stage the following day. There are 12 stages in total that criss-cross Saudi Arabia, covering a total of 8000km – 5000 of them competitive. The Rally ends on 17 January.

284,Would it be fairer to tax cars on weight rather than CO2 emissions?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/car-tax-based-on-vehicle-weight-not-co2-emissions/,Tim Pollard,2025-01-03,Car Magazine UK,"Ever wondered if bigger, heavier are really the answer to private transport’s emissions problems? Vehicles of all persuasions – battery, plug-ins, hybrids, petrols and diesels – have become indisputably chunkier in recent years, owing to safety and emissions legislation and the social mores of oneupmanship. A bigger car, especially a modish SUV, is often perceived to be a status symbol. The weight of a typical family hatchback has doubled in the past 50 years and calls are growing across Europe to stop the automotive obesity crisis. Two automotive analysts in Britain have published a book on the matter – . Authors Felix Leach and Nick Molden question if the blinkered approach of electrifying everything is the right answer and point out that electric vehicles (EVs) tend to be around 40% heavier than traditional combustion alternatives. Bulkier cars require bigger batteries and more materials to build, use up more road and parking space, and furthermore emit greater emissions from tyre, brake and road wear – countering the benefits of zero tailpipe emissions. The book eschews traditional government thinking that focuses purely on carbon dioxide emissions and proposes a new, technology-agnostic solution that instead on their mass. It argues that a vehicle’s kerbweight is a smarter way to charge road users, as it creates a virtuous circle that will encourage smaller, lighter cars with less environmental impact. ‘Our exhaustive research has revealed that one easy metric — car weight — gives a surprisingly good estimate of overall pollution, including greenhouse gases, air toxics, noise, safety and infrastructure impacts,’ said Molden. ‘Consumers can therefore use this to choose their next car, without being baffled by data from biased sources.’ The Molden-Leach Conjecture would use the published kerbweight of a vehicle multiplied by the distance driven in a year to measure its environmental impact. The authors suggest it is a fairer and more accurate way to assess road tax and the data required is already captured in European DIN specifications and MOT certification. In short, the lighter a car and the less it’s driven, the lower the tax burden. The book claims a driver would pay £100 less a year if their car was 150kg lighter than the average or if they drove 1000km (620 miles) below the UK average. ‘No longer will governments have to force a chosen golden technology on everyone. Rather, drivers will be able to freely choose what car to buy and how many miles they drive, but will have to pay the right amount for the environmental damage.’ Molden is the founder and CEO of Emissions Analytics, a company he set up in 2011 to measure real-world emissions of road cars – a topic that fell in the limelight in the wake of the Volkswagen dieselgate emissions scandal of 2016. Leach is an Associate Professor of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford and is a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. They claim that a move to a weight-assessed taxation system would end the automotive ‘age of auto-besity.’ Sadly, it appears not any time soon. You can read our handy explainer on today, but a spokesman for HM Treasury told : ‘We have no plans to reform Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) to be based solely on weight. The shift to electric vehicles is crucial for decarbonising the transport sector and tackling climate change, and will support growth and productivity across the UK.’ Norway has introduced a tax on heavier cars and France started charging a €10 (£8) supplement on petrol and diesel cars for every kilogram they weigh over 1800kg while .

285,Combustion Golf production to leave Europe as VW Group makes sweeping savings,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/german-factories/,Jake Groves,2025-01-03,Car Magazine UK,"After Volkswagen Group announced it had ‘one, maybe two’ years to turn its ailing fortunes around in the middle of 2024, the business has come to an agreement with its Works Council and the IG Metall union and has put in place a series of plans designed to save billions of Euros per year. Among a range of sweeping cuts, readjustments and cost savings, the Group’s ‘Zukinft Volkswagen’ plan has come after critical and sometimes fiery negotiations with its workers and unions. The biggest news among the changes is that a symbol of German engineering prowess, , will have its production moved from the VW brand’s Wolfsburg home factory to its Puebla facility in Mexico from 2027. ‘Following the long and intensive negotiations, the agreement is an important signal for the future viability of the Volkswagen brand, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and the component plants. With the package of measures that has been agreed, the company has set a decisive course for its future in terms of costs, capacities and structures,’ says Oliver Blume, VW Group CEO (pictured above). ‘We are now back in a position to successfully shape our own destiny. The Board of Management and the wider management team are making a greater than proportional financial contribution.’ Less demand and a slower electrification transition than initially thought are the primary reasons, as well as increasing pressures from new brands arriving from China, are cited as to why some European car makers’ fortunes are shaky of late. Certain brands are even changing stances on electrification; Audi, for example, is and Volvo relaxing its plan to be EV-only by 2030. Others are knocking back their planned number of EV sales by certain dates. ‘The market is just not there,’ said VW Group chief financial officer Arno Antlitz in front of around 25,000 workers at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg facility in September 2024, . Volkswagen is reportedly facing a loss of demand of around 500,000 cars – a figure Antlitz says is equivalent to around two factories-worth of output. Volkswagen AG CEO, Oliver Blume, added in September 2024 that ‘there are no more cheques coming from China,’ pointing to Volkswagen losing its sales lead in the country. The comments during the meeting were met with resistance and protests from employees, with VW Works Council head, Daniela Cavallo, stating that management has ‘massively damaged trust.’ Cavallo pointed to a recent deal between Volkswagen and Rivian to develop software, urging management to explain why that circa £3.8bn investment is more important than German plant workers. Another issue is labour costs. Given Volkswagen has so many of its facilities in its home country where wages for manufacturing labour are extremely high, it means the Group has . Volkswagen Group spent 15.4 per cent of its revenue on labour in 2023, compared to 12.7 per cent of Porsche, 10.9 per cent for Mercedes-Benz, 10.1 per cent for Stellantis and 9.5 per cent for BMW Group. The Zukunft Volkswagen (Future Volkswagen) plan is the agreed set of initiatives between the board of management and employee representatives on the future strategy of the group. ‘We have set ourselves three priorities for the future of the Volkswagen brand: Reduce overcapacity in Germany, reduce labour costs and achieve competitive development costs. The negotiations have led to viable results in all three areas. With the agreed package of measures, we are in a position to largely close the gap in our performance programme,’ says Volkswagen passenger cars CEO, Thomas Schäfer (pictured below). In the statement regarding the plan, Volkswagen says that production capacity will be reduced by around 734,000 units in its German facilities, adding that it is ‘responding to the decreasing automotive market in Europe and the increasingly fierce competition, while at the same time creating the fundamental requirements for continued commercially viable production at its home base in Germany.’ While that doesn’t mean immediate plant closures, the wider plans do affect Germany’s various production sites and its employees in the medium to long-term future. The plan is designed to reduce labour costs by around €1.5bn per year. Volkswagen says that the new agreement will ‘provide job security for the workforce of Volkswagen AG at the collectively agreed level until the end of 2030, as agreed during the collective bargaining negotiations. To this end, the company and Works Council have agreed on a socially responsible reduction in the workforce of more than 35,000 across Volkswagen’s German sites by 2030, alongside the structural production measures.’ Wolfsburg, , will undergo a series of changes. Chief among which, mentioned at the start, is the entire production of the Volkswagen Golf hatchback and Estate will be moved out in 2027. While the Golf has always been built in various plants around the world since its launch in 1974, this marks the first time the perennial VW car will not be built in its home country since its inception. To replace it, production will be moved out of VW’s Zwickau facility and moved into Wolfsburg, as well as the . Production lines will be reduced to two, instead of the current four. Volkswagen does say, however, that , will be built at Wolfsburg. Around 4000 jobs will be cut by 2030 within the Group’s ‘Technical Development’ team, which is also based at Wolfsburg. The Group says those remaining will focus on the entire brand portfolio’s development and not just Volkswagen’s. Given Zwickau will have ID.3 and Cupra Born production taken away, its sole manufacturing line from 2027 will be . VW says that ‘new business areas are to be developed in the context of the circular economy,’ to keep the factory afloat. Dresden’s ‘Transparent Factory’ fares worse. It, too, was building the ID.3, and was even labelled the ‘Home of ID’ by VW. Even so, Volkswagen says it intends to discontinue vehicle production there at the end of 2025, adding that the Group is ‘working on alternative options,’ including ‘the possibility of Volkswagen AG participating in a third-party scheme.’ Over at Emden, production of the , and will continue, but there’s no mention of the . Slow sales and of the coupe SUV could lead to its cancellation. For Osnabrück, Volkswagen confirms it will continue to produce the there ‘until mid-2027.’ After that, the Group says that ‘options for a different use of the site are currently being explored.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

287,"2024 car sales figures: these are the winners and losers",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/uk-2024-car-sales-analysis-winners-and-losers/,Ted Welford,2025-01-06,Car Magazine UK,"New car registrations increased by 2.6 per cent in 2024, according to data revealed today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Sales increased to 1.953 million units, with growing by 21.4 per cent to 382,000 registrations. EVs accounted for 19.6 per cent of the overall market in 2024, but failed to meet the 22 per cent set out by the government in its . But this growth isn’t as promising or natural as it first looks. Our analysts have pored over the SMMT data to provide a detailed look of the 2024 UK new car sales figures, including a full breakdown of the winners and losers, the UK’s best-selling car brands and more. New car registrations increased by a modest 2.6 per cent in 2024, with a total of 1.952 million units being sold, though the growth flattened towards the end of the year – even amid a push for EV registrations, which we’ll explore in the next section. While sales were up, they are still well behind pre-pandemic levels, when 2.311 million units were registered in 2019. Registrations of electric, hybrid and models all increased last year, with petrol and diesel both down overall. That said, petrol remains by far the most dominant fuel, with a 52.2 per cent share, if down on a 56 per cent share in 2023. The biggest worry for manufacturers this year has been the , which came into force in 2024 and requires every manufacturer to sell a certain percentage of electric cars otherwise they face steep fines. For 2024, firms had to hit a 22 per cent EV share. While EVs accounted for a 19.6 per cent share in 2024, behind the mandated figure, the Department for Transport (DfT) put out a statement saying it was “confident the whole market has complied” and “no manufacturer will need to pay fines”. This is based on the flexibilities in the scheme that can allow firms to borrow credits from firms with an already high EV share or defer for a year while firms ramp up EV sales, even if they did not hit it in 2024. Despite this, the SMMT figures still reveal a desperate push at the end of the year from manufacturers to register as many EVs as possible, with EVs accounting for a 31 per cent share in December, well above the average for the year of 19.6 per cent. If you delve deeper into those figures, it’s obvious that with petrol sales down by around 15,000 units in the month, and EVs up by around the same number, the rumours that some manufacturers were limiting the number of ICE cars they were selling in the last months were very much true. The SMMT also believes that EVs only have a natural demand of around 11 or 12 per cent, with Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT saying that it’s “clear demand has not matched the assumptions behind the mandate when it was conceived”. The has retained its position as the UK’s best-selling car in 2024, with 48,340 sold throughout the year. It narrowly beats the on 48,340 registrations and the British-built on 42,418. All five of the top five best-selling cars in 2024 were SUVs for the first time, with only two non-SUVs in the top 10. While the the only pure-electric car to make the list overall in the year, if you look at the list for December, it’s dominated by electric models – showing the push to sell as many EVs as possible in that final month. The full list is as follows: A delve into the list of the best-selling electric cars gives a good idea as to who is storming it with their EVs and who is struggling. It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that it’s the Tesla Model Y up there at the top, with an impressive 32,862 examples sold over the course of the year, almost twice as many as the next EV. More of a surprise is the (17,622) up there as the second most popular EV, even outselling the (17,425). Volkswagen will be disappointed that its (8,927) only just sneaks into the top 10, while the (9,931) had an excellent first full year on sale. The full list is as follows: remains the UK’s most popular car brand by some margin, with 166k cars registered in 2024. (125k) overtook (122k) and had its best year ever with 112k cars registered. The Sportage alone accounts for 42 per cent of Kia’s volume. (110k) slipped by three places to fifth position, while (103k) had a stellar year and climbed ninth to sixth. (100k) retained its position but saw sales climb from ever- growing popularity of its and Qashqai, which combined count more than 75 per cent of Nissan’s sales. It was also the only manufacturer to have two cars in the top 10. (92k) climbed a place into ninth, while (82k) sneaked into the top 10 brands list for the first time. In terms of outright percentage growth, it’s up there at the top with a gigantic 659 per cent increase on its 2023 performance. With sales of 8,788, it registered more cars than Polestar. New Chinese firm had a strong start, too, with a policy of getting as many cars out there as possible resulting in strong numbers, with an extensive demo fleet and established dealer network already in operation. It registered a healthy 3,629 cars in its first year – more than triple that of . also had a bumper year courtesy of its , which helped it to almost triple its 2023 sales, registering 9,041 cars last year. Smart also had a good year with continued growth for its #1 and , with sales up 153 per cent, though it still sold shy of 2,000 cars. As for more mainstream car brands that had a bumper 2024, up there at the top is , which saw registrations surge by 36 per cent to 57,967 sales, helped by strong demand for its Clio, Austral and . also saw its sales grow once again, registering 66,408 cars in the year. Just shy of half of these were its , which continues to prove hugely popular, and the electric EX30 also had an excellent first year. And just as a surprise, had one final blow out of its ‘old’ era, with sales growing 17 per cent in 2024 to 16,617 units as it rushed to clear stock before the end of year. Once favourites of the British public, Ford and Vauxhall, were two brands to suffer in 2024. Ford sales fell by 24 per cent, but that equates to almost 35,000 fewer cars being sold last year than in 2023. Though the Puma remained the UK’s best-seller, the knock-on effect of no longer having the , and dwindling sales, did the Blue Oval’s car sales no favours. It should be said, however, that Ford remains the leader in the van world, with its Transit Custom, big Transit and Ranger making up the three best-selling commercial vehicles. sales also fell more than 20,000 units year-on-year, and were down 21 per cent to 78,000 units. The has really fell of buyers’ shopping lists, going from being the UK’s most popular car in 2021 to not even being a part of the top 10. It’s also the first time in decades Vauxhall wasn’t one of the top 10 car brands, even being overtaken by MG. On a more niche level, continues to struggle as buyers just don’t consider the French premium brand, with sales down 52 per cent to just 1,152 units. Even sold more cars than DS last year. Other disappointments include Maserati, which saw sales dip by 47.4 per cent – all the more worrying considering it’s the first full year Maserati has sold its , which should have spurred growth. It sold just 469 cars in 2024. After a positive start, Ineos struggled to keep momentum with its , with sales falling by 60 per cent to just 350 units. Polestar has also had a struggle in 2024, with management changes and financial struggles not helping its fortunes. Sales fell by 31 per cent to 8,693 units, more the disappointing considering it introduced both the and Polestar 4 in 2024, albeit later in the year.

288,How company car tax is calculated: benefit-in-kind and P11D explained,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/how-company-car-tax-is-calculated/,CAR magazine,2025-01-07,Car Magazine UK,"Company cars, whether sold through fleets or businesses, now account for a far greater share of new car sales than those to private individuals, and this percentage has only kept increasing in recent years. As a result, it makes it an important sector that car manufacturers target, especially for , which are considerably cheaper to run as company cars. Though a company car is often a perk of a job, it’s by no means free as there’s a tax implication on it, which can prove significant depending on the car. Let’s look at how company car tax is calculated, how much it costs and any changes on the horizon. All of this will help you if you’re looking for a company car andl help you to make an informed financial decision. A company car is seen as a benefit-in-kind (BIK) by HMRC since it’s usually supplied as a perk in addition to an employee’s salary. This means that if you use a company car, you are required to pay annual tax on it, in the same way that you would if your employer gave you free health insurance. BIK tax rates change most years and the planned rates for future years are known well in advance. In the UK, company car tax is decided by a vehicle’s emissions, its value and your personal income tax rate. Every car has a BIK tax banding percentage, which is based on the CO2 emissions it produces. As most company cars are kept for several years, it’s worth looking at future years. For example, all plug-in hybrids will have a steep increase in company car tax in the 2028/29 financial year. The bandings are as follows. A P11D value is used to calculate company car tax, and is an important number for this reason. ​​The P11D value is the total value of a car when it was new, including the list price, optional extras (including paint colours and different wheels), VAT and delivery charges from the manufacturer. However, it does include the DVLA first registration fee or annual road tax. It therefore tends to look slightly different to the actual on-the-road price quoted by dealers and by CAR. The main factor in working out how much company car tax you’ll pay depends on a vehicle’s CO2 emissions. The cleaner it is, the less you’ll pay, which is why it generally favours electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid models, although there is some uncertainty surrounding PHEVs, as we’ll explore in a later section. If you’re looking at a plug-in hybrid as a company car, look at its quoted electric range as this will also influence what you’ll pay. To calculate the company car (BIK) tax, multiply the P11D value by the BIK percentage figure, and then multiply that figure by your personal tax band (20 or 40 per cent). This figure will give you the annual amount of BIK you need to pay, so divide it by 12 to see the monthly outgoing. Here are two examples of company car tax for the 2025/26 financial year. Tesla Model 3 RWD £39,935 0g/km 3% £1,198.05 (3% of the P11D list price) £239.61 per annum (lower rate taxpayer at 20% tax), £479.22 (higher rate taxpayer at 40% tax) Volkswagen Golf Style 1.5 eTSI £30,400 121g/km 30% £9,120 (30% of the P11D list price) £1,824 per annum (lower rate taxpayer at 20% tax), £3,648 (higher rate taxpayer at 40% tax) If you look at the difference between what you’ll pay on an electric car and a run-of-the-mill petrol hatchback like a Volkswagen Golf, you’ll get an idea of why electric cars are proving so popular to company car drivers because of the cost savings on offer. Alongside electric cars, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) have proven popular with company car drivers owing to their cheaper BIK as a result of their lower claimed CO2 emissions. However, many PHEVs now face a potentially steep increase in BIK rates because of a change in how emissions tests are carried out on them. Known as Euro 6e-bis, the revised emissions test applies to all newly launched PHEVs from January 1, 2025, and will apply to all new models by the end of 2025. The more rigorous test now involves measuring a vehicle’s emissions for a greater distance when a PHEV’s battery is empty, and therefore when they’re least efficient. To illustrate the difference the changes will make, the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) analysed the effect on a BMW X1 plug-in hybrid. Under the current testing model, this car has an official CO2 emission value of around 45g/km, but under the new tests, the emissions value will more than double to 96g/km. This will see the BIK rate increase from 8% to 24%, and will mean a significant increase in what you’ll pay in company car tax Drivers who already have a PHEV as a company car will not be affected, but those ordering a new car could see a steep potential steep increase if the car is retested between the point of ordering and delivery. Fewer are likely to choose PHEVs as company cars as a result of these measures, either."
289,Sony’s Afeela 1 EV is finally going on sale,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/sony/afeela-1/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-07,Car Magazine UK,"The Afeela 1, from Sony and Honda’s new Sony Honda Mobility brand, is finally going on sale. The car was debuted a few years ago now, but at this year’s CES show in Las Vegas, the new company announced final specs, pricing and delivery details for its first EV. ‘Sony Honda Mobility strives to evolve relationships with people through intelligent mobility and revolutionize the travel experience,’ said Yasuhide Mizuno, chairperson and CEO of Sony Honda Mobility at the annual technology show. ‘We are very pleased to unveil Afeela 1, developed for the era of autonomous driving, at CES 2025. Afeela 1 can be called a buddy, combining advanced software with meticulously refined hardware.’ Keep reading for everything you need to know about Sony’s first EV. The Afeela 1 will be available in two trims, with the base level Origin trim starting off at $89,900. For reference, that’s a good chunk more than the entry-level Tesla Model S AWD in America, but some $5000 cheaper than what the top-of-the-line commands. These cheaper Origin models will be delivered in 2027 and roll on 19-inch wheels. Just one colour will be offered: Core Black. The Signature trim rises to $102,900 (around £82,000) and gets you larger 21-inch wheels, an entertainment system for rear passengers and more cameras. The Signature will be offered in three, muted colours: Tidal Gray, Calm White, and Core Black. Sony Honda Mobility is targeting a production range of around 300 miles, and when the battery does run out, customers in the States will be able to use . Order books for the Signature will open in California later this year, with deliveries expected in the second half of 2026. The cheaper Origin model will follow soon after. Japan will get its hands on the Afeela 1 in 2026 – but there’s no word on Europe yet. Still, if you live in California, you can reserve one now for just $200. It does, and that’s not a good or a bad thing, as there’s nothing too memorable about the Afeela 1. Instead, it’s quiet and sophisticated a bit like Sony’s understated audio products. It measures 4915mm in length, 1900mm in width and is 1461mm tall with a 3000 mm wheelbase. That’s puts it at roughly the same size as Tesla’s Model S too. In person the Vision S concept felt to be a similar size, though SHM’s styling made it feel a little chunkier and more upmarket. As seen on the Vision S, the Afeela 1 also benefits from screens which can provide information to the driver, or other road users depending on the situation. Both models major on safety and entertainment tech, using around 40 sensors to power their ADAS systems. The Afeela 1’s ECU uses AI technology (of course) to more accurately run the car’s numerous pre-sense systems. Gamers will also recognise the Unreal graphics engine, which the Afeela 1 uses to visualise its environment to passengers on the dash. As seen on the Vision S concept cars, voice control and Sony’s sound expertise also play a key role in the cabin, with passengers able to enjoy 360 Spatial Sound Technology on the higher end model. A range of apps – from TikTok to Spotify – will also be offered and 70% of the interior is recycled. Oh, and the driver will need to use a yoke steering wheel. It’ll be interesting to see whether SHM has gone for a Toyota or Tesla-style approach to its steering-feel. Interestingly Sony Honda Mobility says the prices above include ‘3-year complementary subscription for certain functionality and features,’ which suggests consumers will have to pay to play for features after that time. It’s a decision we’ve seen before, and one that even BMW has had to U-turn on with its short-lived CarPlay subscription. Let’s see what happens… Sony also revealed a SUV version of its Afeela car, so it’s likely that could follow in the next few years. Like , SHM will lead with a high-end saloon before a more family orientated car. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

290,BMW launches OS X and Panoramic iDrive with full cabin-width display,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-idrive-os-x/,James Dennison,2025-01-07,Car Magazine UK,"BMW does not do things on a small scale anymore. The grilles and kerb weights of its cars have attracted controversy in recent years and to keep things consistent the latest version of iDrive has also been supersized as part of the upcoming Neue Klasse brand refresh. Called Panoramic iDrive with BMW Operating System X, the tech includes a full windscreen-width display capable of showing a raft of info, along with additional head-up display and touchscreens. Is it a good thing? We attended an early hands-on demo of the system to find out… In order to show off the tech, BMW presented us with a giant mock-up of a car cabin with the Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X. Starting with the steering wheel, there’s two black touch control panels either side of the centre. The various functions (cruise control, volume, skipping tracks, answering the phone) are activated via touch icons that appear when necessary, rather than physical buttons. Potentially concerning, but we had a go on a normal-sized mock-up and the functionality seemed intuitive enough on first impressions. Glance over to the side and the matrix backlight central infotainment touchscreen isn’t a million miles off what we’re used to in BMWs. However, the screen itself is now positioned closer to the steering wheel to make it easier for the driver operate. Meanwhile, the design of the screen’s menus has also been optimised, moving shortcuts and crucial functions (such as the headlamp control and driver assistance) closer to the wheel. The BMW Operating System X software is based on a Android Open Source Project software stack that, BMW claims, allows significant scope for personalisation and regular wireless updates. As seen in the gallery, there’s even the possibility of adding personal photos as background screens. Improved natural-language dialogue voice activation also features and promises to improve real-world hands-free control of the infotainment. There’s no doubt however that the BMW Panoramic Vision is the main story. Stretching across the base of the windscreen, the display is almost entirely customisable and presents info blocks such as transmission selection, what track you’re listening to on Spotify and outside air quality. It’s also capable of switching colour scheme and layout when the driver activates one of the sportier drive modes, providing suggestions on how to improve the experience using vehicle functions – such as reduced driver assistance. We also saw a demonstration of how an incoming phone call is displayed, with the Panoramic Vision display switching to a notification mode and the wheel highlighting the call answer and reject buttons. Finally, the 3D head-up display sits atop of the Panoramic Vision display and gives yet more information including augmented reality sat-nav prompts and automated driving graphics. Clearly, there’s an awful lot going on here and it remains to be seen whether such a wealth of information – from three different display sources – will be overwhelming for the driver. Early demonstrations suggest the info is well-integrated and relatively easy-to-use once you get your head around the vast scale of it, however it remains to be seen how this translates into real-world use cases – especially among BMW’s performance-enthusiast customers. The Panoramic iDrive with BMW Operating System X will feature in all Neue Klasse models, with the first launch set to be an SUV replacing the iX3 in 2025.

But no tears are being shed at Goodwood, as its lucrative Bespoke customisation division is booming. The sales increase in recent years has been led by the , but in 2024 its top spot was rivalled by the Spectre coupe, Rolls-Royce’s first electric car. In Europe the outsold the Cullinan, while in the Americas, the Middle East and Asia Pacific the EV was second to the SUV. A second EV will be shown later this year, but Rolls is not revealing any details yet. The year’s total was 5712, down from 2023’s 6032, but still the company’s third-highest total ever. The total was ‘in line with the marque’s forecasts and expectations’, it said. Chief executive Chris Brownridge said the best-ever results from the Bespoke division – up 10 per cent – ‘demonstrate our clients are increasingly drawn to the marque to create ever more ambitious and valuable motor cars, thereby enjoying the exceptional and highly personalised experience that Rolls-Royce ownership unlocks.’ Recent Bespoke projects included in-cabin gold sculptures, embroidery and mother-of-pearl adornments. The long-wheelbase version of the Phantom attracted the most Bespoke commissions, while the Middle East was the region with the most Bespoke clients. Overall, North America remains the company’s biggest market. In order to be able to do more Bespoke and one-off Coachbuild projects, work is under way on a £300 million extension at Goodwood, making room for ever more elaborate customisation work. The new building will also ease Rolls-Royce’s transition to an all-electric future.

292,Honda 0 Series: dramatic new EVs with ‘Asimo’ OS to hit production in 2026,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/honda/0-series/,Jake Groves,2025-01-08,Car Magazine UK,"Honda’s new 0 Series of super smart, dramatically-designed EVs takes a step further to production reality at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show. The 0 Series will make its production launch in 2026, with Honda previewing its new generation of electric cars with the 0 Series Saloon and 0 Series SUV. At CES 2025, Honda says that the two cars on its show floor are prototypes based on the concepts from the year prior. The 0 Series Saloon is described as the flagship model, sporting a segment-blending shape that smashes crossover, shooting brake and Lamborghini Gallardo all together into one cyberpunk-spec model. The 0 SUV (pictured above), meanwhile, is the next step from the Space Hub concept. This will actually be the first production-spec 0 model to go into production in 2026, says Honda, promising a large amount of space inside and cutting edge software designed to handle the car’s dynamics. Technical specs for both cars are light at the moment, so we’ll have to stay tuned for now. Both production cars, as well as any others that launch under the 0 Series sub-brand will all run on Honda’s new Asimo OS. The operating system is a ground-up development from Honda named after its series of robots it developed over two decades. The new OS is designed to aid in the brand’s plan to bring Level 3 autonomy to its 0 Series cars, and has AI integrated into it to help with decision making. Honda says that its new 0 Series cars ‘will be equipped with a system that enables the expansion of the range of driving conditions where driver assistance and Level 3 automated driving will be available. This expansion will start with eyes-off technology available in traffic congestion on highways, and will continue through OTA updates.’ It also adds that it wants to be ‘the first auto maker to enable eyes-off driving in all driving situations.’ We’ll update this story when we know more about the production-spec Honda 0 Series models. The Saloon and Space-Hub concepts give the first look at the new 0, or zero, Series and they have been developed using a new approach that Honda is summing up with the tagline ‘Thin, Light and Wise.’ Honda is taking a fresh approach to its electric vehicle range, saying that it is heading back to the starting point of the brand – hence heading back to zero. It will have efficiency, lightness, space, safety and driver enjoyment at its core as the brand continues towards its stated goal of being fully electric by 2040. The Saloon is the flagship model and is a low-slung four-seater that sits on a new dedicated EV platform, while the Space-Hub is a larger and boxier people carrier that is more of a blend of MPV and SUV. Both feature a fluid windscreen design that sweeps up from the front of the vehicle over to the rear end in one continues line. They are not replacements for existing vehicles, but are a statement of intent as to where the brand wants to take its next generation of EVs. However, they are more than just concepts, with Honda president Toshihiro Mibe saying that a production version of the Saloon will be on sale in less than two years, with models heading to the market in America from 2026. It will then go on sale around the world, with Europe one of the planned markets for sales. It is just under five metres long and remarkably low for a car that is heading into a world dominated by SUVs. Despite the slightly futuristically retro styling, Honda says that the looks are about 90% away from the finished production version. The doors, which are currently top-hinged gullwing affairs, are likely to change, with more conventional front-hinged ones expected for the production model. The digital front end has more chance of making it to production, although this is not something that has been decided on yet. Honda says it is exploring the option, though. The Space-Hub is more of a concept vehicle, with no planned production equivalent as yet. However, a smaller vehicle in a similar mould to the Space-Hub is planned and will follow not far behind the Saloon. Honda hasn’t gone into great technical detail on both vehicles, but it has said that the 0 Series models will feature e-axles, which feature motor, inverter and gearbox. It is also claiming that the new vehicles will be lighter and efficient, with high-density battery packs combining with the aerodynamic capabilities brought about by the sweeping styling. The final version of the Saloon will also feature a steer-by-wire system and what is said to be a surprisingly spacious interior. The Space-Hub majors on interior space, too, with huge windows and a great degree of flexibility in the cabin. The 0 Series has been conceived so Honda can take a fresh start with its electric vehicles, and multiple models will be launched under it for the time being. It will run alongside the existing Honda models, with vehicles such as the Jazz and Civic remaining outside of it for the time being. It will start with larger models such as the Saloon, with smaller Honda models such as a Jazz or HR-V equivalent set to be launched towards the end of the decade. There is no overarching bodystyle that will define the 0 Series, with low-slung models such as the Saloon set to sit alongside superminis, smaller people carriers and a larger SUV-style model that will sit about the Saloon. There could potentially even be a , although this is not confirmed for now. While the exterior of the Saloon is ‘90% there’ the interior of the concept car is a little further away for now. However, some features are likely to make it to production. The upright nature of the side windows allow for a little more interior space, with this spaciousness likely to be a goal for the production car. As with many vehicles on show at CES 2024, the 0 Series has AI technology integrated into its cabin as it offers an enhanced level of autonomous driving and user experience. The cars are able to monitor their driver’s actions and decisions to tailor their experience. It will be able to learn what music you like to listen to, and learn how you drive and make suggestions as a result. It will also be able to provide local information on the surrounding area and provide last-mile directions when you are close to your destination. The AD and ADAS systems will build on the level three abilities offered by vehicles such as the Honda Legend that was launched in the US in 2021. This will be achieved by driver monitoring tech that will able to make risk predictions and therefore provide a greater degree of hands-off autonomous driving in more areas, rather than just on the motorway. This high-level of autonomy doesn’t mean sacrificing driver enjoyment, says Honda. Autonomous driving can mean enjoying the scenery and relaxing, but if the character of the vehicle is good as well then it can be entertaining to drive. Honda also announced that it is building a new battery plant as result of a joint venture with LG Energy, which it expects to have ready by the end of the year. It aims to address two major concerns about batteries and electric vehicles – the charging time and battery degradation. By the late 2020s, it says you should be able to charge from 15% to 80% in as little as 15 minutes, while it is also aiming to bring battery degradation down to a maximum of 10% over a 10-year period. In addition, it is still aiming for solid-state batteries by the late 2020s. Inevitably it is too soon to put a precise price on the production version of the Honda 0 Series Saloon given that the finished version has yet to be revealed. However, Honda has said that it is intending to provide value to customers in a wide range, so there will still be an affordable 0 Series models. Don’t expect the Saloon to be this version, though, as it is very much the flagship of the new 0 Series range. The naming structure is also still to be confirmed, with Honda not being drawn on whether it will feature a combination of letters, like CR-V, or be a name, like Civic or Jazz.

293,Porsche's 992.2-generation 911 Carrera S lands for £120k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/911-992/,Piers Ward,2025-01-08,Car Magazine UK,"Porsche’s 992.2-generation 911 model has grown beyond the initial GTS hybrid to include the Carrera S once again. The every-person Porsche model is available to order now. What you get for your money is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre engine that develops 473bhp, which is 29bhp more than before and 391lb ft. Despite this being one the cheapest and least powerful 911 models, Porsche claims a possible 3.3sec 0-62mph time and a top speed of 191mph. As well as the power boost, Carrera S models benefit from bespoke 20-inch front/21-inch rear wheels, a standard sports exhaust system and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus as standard – as well as revised and improved brakes. A black leather interior is standard, and Porsche says the Carrera S benefits from the same standard tech as any other 911 – namely details like matrix LED headlights and a wireless phone charger. Prices for the latest Carrera S start at £119,800 for the coupe, or £129,800 for the Carrera S Cabriolet. And, naturally because it’s a Porsche, you can go wild with the configurator with plenty of potential options including carbon ceramic brakes and sports suspension. Want to know about the new GTS T-Hybrid model? We have the full debrief below… Air to water, naturally-aspirated to turbo’d, and now hybrid. The Porsche 911 has been through plenty of iterations in its 61-year history and now there’s a further dramatic twist as the 911 embraces electrification. Roll that around in your head – the 911 has gone hybrid. It comes as part of the facelift for the 992 generation, dubbed 992.2: for the moment, the only updated models are the Carrera GTS (running the T-Hybrid system) and Carrera, the latter continuing with an updated version of the 3.0-litre twin turbo and no hybrid function. Crucially, this ‘base’ model starts at £99,800 so Porsche can still claim you can slide into a 911 for less than 100k (the GTS Coupe starts at £132,600 and is available as Targa, Cabriolet, two- or four-wheel drive). This is not a hybrid as we know it (see below where we get a passenger ride). Instead, Porsche is aiming for maximum performance advantage, with minimal weight gain and zero efficiency benefit. There is no electric-only driving – that’s been possible in the past, noticeably in the 918 Spyder, but the 911 DNA and character is hallowed turf for Porsche. Mess with it at your peril. So what we have is an all-new 3.6-litre engine running two electric motors – one in the turbo between the compressor and turbine wheels, and the other, more traditional permanent magnet unit, located at the rear end of the PDK gearbox. The turbo is the clever one, although not completely unique as both Mercedes and Audi have run with similar set-ups. Here, it runs with an over-sized single turbo and provides up to 30bhp of assistance, spinning at up to 120,000rpm. Not a huge number of bhp, but it’s more how it provides power that transforms the GTS, giving up to 110lb ft of additional torque at low engine speeds. By providing an instant boost and negating any sort of turbo lag, it has transformed the car’s character – Porsche showed us various graphs that demonstrate how the Carrera GTS can reach peak acceleration seconds faster than a standard Carrera. In fact, it’s capable of out-stripping a Turbo S in the first 2.5 seconds from standstill. There’s no longer a wastegate on the turbo. Instead, the electric motor does the same job, braking the system and transferring the recovered energy to the battery or second e-motor in the PDK ‘box depending on the use case. The lithium-ion battery sits up front, behind the boot, and is only 1.9kWh. No electric running means you don’t need masses of cells and comes with the extra bonus of minimal additional weight (27kg). Porsche is claiming that, overall, the Carrera GTS is only 50kg heavier than the predecessor [i] but be careful with that caveat. As standard, the new car only comes with two seats. Compare like-for-like across the generations by inserting two rear seats (a no-cost option) and the weight gap jumps to about 75kg. 400V electrics power all this, with the result that you no longer need any external belt drive to power things like the starter motor or alternator. Indeed, the GTS no longer even has a starter motor, that job being done by the e-motor in the PDK and with a result of an instant ‘catch’. Much like a race car, it has minimal turnover, springing to life almost as soon as you thumb the new-for-992.2 starter button. Sadly not. There’s no manual in the Carrera GTS as it won’t work with the twin e-motor set-up. But one will still be available in the future when Porsche gets round to updating further models. My money would be on it being in the updated 911 T, given that the ‘old’ 3.0 litre twin turbo will continue to be sold and we know that it can run a manual. It’s another way of making the T distinct and cementing its halo status among non-GT 911s. Rear-axle steering is now standard on the GTS (and hasn’t helped with the weight gain), while Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control is now electro-hydraulically controlled thanks to the high-voltage hybrid set-up. One further advantage of this is that the nose lift is much quicker to activate. In Porsche terms, yes. The 10 active aero vanes at the front are the biggest clue – these help reduce the drag coefficient from 0.32 to 0.27Cd and also give the car a much more dramatic, shark-gill style. It’s not the only element of active aerodynamics, as there’s a diffuser under both the bonnet and front wing that channels air depending on where it’s needed. The headlights are also new and run Porsche’s now trademark four-point graphic. In typical Porsche logic, there’s a two-fold reason for this. Aesthetic, but also practical: by ditching the front indicator from the bumper and housing it within the headlight, there’s more space for cooling. Inside, the analogue rev counter has been dropped for a digital one, helpful for making Apple CarPlay much more integrated but a pity for the purists. There are now thinner rear lights, a new air inlet at the rear and a centre, twin-pipe exhaust. The rear tyres are also bigger on the GTS, measuring 315 across instead of 305. Helpful when it comes to putting down the extra low-down oomph of the GTS. Looking at all this and being contrary, you do wonder why they bothered: they had a perfectly acceptable bi-turbo engine that had more life in it. Indeed, it carries on in the Carrera. And yet they’ve still built an entire new powertrain at great cost that delivers negligible fuel savings; in today’s climate-skewed world, it seems like a miss. Not according to Michael Roesler, director model car line 911: ‘If you want to do a big step, hybrid technology is a good step for that. We wanted to make the 911 future-proof for any upcoming regulations. With the ICE, I think we’ve reached a really high level where I do not expect those big steps we made with the hybrid design.’ It’s clear, then, that there’s more to come from this technology – the GTS is merely the first rung. Not that it’s without risk. I’ve got two pals who have both bought a 992.1 car on the basis that they were worried about the facelifted car getting flabby and electrified. They feared the loss of edge and for the very soul of the car. Judging by the theory and reality we saw in the GTS, both of those guys went too early. The 911 is in rude health. Stepping from a passenger ride in a Carrera 4 GTS, all I could do was puff my cheeks out and emit a ‘foof’ of air. Blame the potency of the 992.2 and the long limbs of Jörg Bergmeister, the man doing the passenger laps at Weissach. Class winner at Le Mans and 911 racer since the Big Bang, he’s not unafraid to push even this prototype car but even so. The levels of speed, grip and engine response meant I was grasping for intelligent ways of describing the experience but my scrambled brain could only mumble expletives. It’s not the engine’s responsiveness that first grabs you. That comes later. What needs an immediate recalibration is the speed it can carry through corners, reacting with an agility that belies the size of the latest 911. It’s no longer a small car, after all. Weirdly, I didn’t find myself using my feet to brace against the bulkhead as the car didn’t have much lateral rotation. Sure, it rolls but not to the point of being uncomfortable – instead, it gives the impression of zero lag in its movements and changes direction faster than any road car should. Especially given the fact it’s on worn Pirelli P Zero road tyres. Noticing the engine comes later, once your brain has learnt to ignore the speeds. Reactions feel fast. Not quite at EV levels but certainly up there with the fastest ICE engines I’ve ever sat in. The 911 Turbo S is more brutal but the finesse on this Carrera GTS’s powertrain is what marks it out. Less sledgehammer, more scalpel. It poses an interesting question. I thought the hybrid GTS would threaten the Turbo 911s, on account of its acceleration. But having ridden in one, I think it’s more a question of concern for the GT department because this 992.2, in GTS trim, is so reactive. The hybrid has created a rawer car than you’d imagine.

294,Mazda 6e revealed: the EZ-6 comes to Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/6e/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Mazda 6e, a from the Japanese brand and its second full EV after the . The only catch? It’s actually a hatchback rather than saloon – and it’s not produced by Mazda, either. The 6e might look familiar and that’s because it’s pretty much identical to the Changan co-developed Mazda EZ-6, a car that impressed when it was unveiled at last year’s Beijing auto show. Now, after a few tweaks, it’s primed for release in Europe – and eventually the UK. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the Mazda 6e. The Mazda 6e is a very different car to the MX-30: it leans not on Mazda’s own R&D resources (which will still develop EVs) but Changan, another Chinese giant not yet in Europe. The reasons for partnering were clear for Mazda Europe’s manager of technology research and technology communication, Uwe Mandal: ‘The advanced technology, battery technology, also the raw materials, the expertise and the capacity are located in China,’ Mandal tells CAR. ‘So, for us it was a good partnership with Changan.’ With that in mind, Mazda’s priority was ensuring the 6e looked like the part – despite its third-party internals: ‘When you look at it now, you can see that it’s really carries the Mazda DNA, the flavour that we usually bring to the market with our purely self-developed vehicles,’ he says. I’d agree. In person the 6e is just as striking as Mazda’s other products; it’s a concoction of intricate details, billowing curves and scalloped recesses – the same styling we’re using to seeing in other segments in cars like the CX-30, but on the more elegant canvas of a saloon. The 6e even benefits from a riff on the brand’s classic round rear lights. Measuring 4921mm long, 2156mm wide and 1461mm high, it’s not small but offers even more space than you’d expect. The 6e also very raked and begins with a low sharp front end, before ending in a high, spacious rear. A spoiler at the rear of the car also opens and closes depending on the speed you’re going. Despite its somewhat athletic looks, there’s a good amount of both head and leg room – even for someone over 6ft – and there’s a 330-litre boot at the rear (which extends to 1074-litres with the seats down). Mazda’s decision to make the 6e hatchback was largely led by internal targets for passenger space and storage. The company is open about some of the styling decisions on the 6e: the new car gets a simple typeface on the rear rather than a badge, because Mazda admits its current logo simply doesn’t have the brand recognition and traction with the car-buying public. The EZ-6’s garish fully-illuminated grille has been lost in translation; only the grille surround lights up on the 6e – and it moves when charging. ‘Chinese customers are more used to expressive signalling and blinking lights,’ Mandal explains to us of the change. ‘But here we want to embody a different design language, one more in line with our Japanese aesthetic approach.’ Other tweaks include sharpened dynamics over the Chinese car: ‘The key is that the vehicle performs as a true Mazda in the European market, to meet European drive expectations,’ he continues. ‘For a nimble drive, for handling, for that typical Mazda feeling. I think in other regions, it’s not as much the focus of customers.’ Unlike the Mazda EZ-6 which is available with REX and pure BEV powertrains, the 6e will launch as a pure EV only. ‘At the moment, we don’t plan [a REX],’ Mandal says, before citing the lengthy process of engineering around emission regulations. ‘We’re stepping into full electrification with this vehicle,’ he says. ‘When you have such powertrain [like the REX] available, I would never say never – but it’s not planned.’ To that end, you only get two powertrain choices with the 6e; a big 68.8kWh battery and a bigger 80kWh battery in the long-range car. The smaller battery offers a range of 298 miles and is paired to a 190kW (255bhp) electric motor which sends 236lb ft to the rear axle. That’s good for 0-62mph in just 7.6 seconds, and a top speed of 109mph. Charging from 10% to 80% can take just 22 minutes. The long range, 80kWh car gets a range of 343 miles, and its 180kW (241bhp) electric motor delivers 236lb ft to the rear axle too. It’s slightly slower to 62mph at 7.8 seconds but has the same top speed of 109mph. Those figures are literally miles away from the paltry MX-30’s, but the Mazda man says this is due to the 6e’s differing use case – not an overall change in EV strategy: ‘The MX-30 was planned as a second car in the household, with more focus on the daily chores,’ he said. ‘The 6e has to be like a main car, a true family car that can go on a holiday or long trip.’ Inside the 6e is a lot techier than the rest of the range, with a huge 14.6-inch touchscreen on the centre stack and a further 10.2-inch digital instrument for the cockpit. On top of that, Mazda has also introduced a head up display which is equivalent to a 50-inch TV when viewed 7.5 metres away (the typical distance a driver is looking ahead). Hand gestures and voice control are also present and new for Mazda, along with a Sony-badged 14-speaker audio system. You’ll find beige or black artificial leather in the standard Takumi package, though that improves to the Tan Nappa and Suede leather in the Takumi Plus. Opt for the latter and you also get an electric sunshade trim instead of the standard tinted panoramic sunroof. The 6e is already in production and will arrive in dealer showrooms in summer this year. The UK will have to wait for a few months for the RHD version, so UK consumers are looking at 2026 for delivery. When order books do open, Mazda believes it’ll be bringing in existing 6 owners as well as fleet managers looking for a high-quality, zero emissions solution: ‘The car clearly going to be really important in fleet,’ a Mazda UK spokesperson told CAR. ‘But also, our dealers are very excited by this car, because there’ll be lots of existing Mazda customers that haven’t made the step to an EV yet.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

295,Atto 2: BYD expands into the electric crossover market,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/byd/atto-2/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"BYD is ramping up its presence in the UK with this; the just revealed Atto 2. Revealed today at the Brussel motor show, it’s a compact electric SUV designed to tap into the hotly contested crossover market. As the name suggests, it slots in just below the larger Atto 3. ‘We’re excited to start 2025 with another important model for our plans in Europe,’ said BYD’s vice president Stella Li. ‘The B-segment SUV class is incredibly popular here, and with the ATTO 2, we have an agile and versatile offering that will appeal to that large potential customer base. It takes all of BYD’s strengths in batteries, electric motors and Cell-to-Body construction and combines them in a compact package that brings new intelligent technologies to the urban SUV class.’ The Atto 2 sticks with BYD’s incredibly conservative, so you get full LED headlight and slim DRLs at the front and a full-width light bar at the rear. BYD’s designers have tried to inject some fun and character in the car – most notably with a figure of eight in the rear lights, for good luck – but overall this a very innocuous-looking car. The fact it comes in Climbing Grey paint as standard, and then extends to the optional hues of Hiking Green, Skiing White and Cosmos Black, should tell you something. Still, this is a car aimed focusing on alue and practicality. At 4310mm long (2620mm wheelbase), 1830mm wide and 1675mm tall, the Atto 2 sits right in the middle of the B-segment SUV market, and is both 145mm shorter and 45mm thinner than its larger Atto 3 sibling. The interior of the car looks as spacious as you’d could hope from an EV in the B-segment, and it’s crammed with storage areas, cup holders and arm rests. Things are kept spacious and airy by a panoramic glass roof, and BYD’s battery tech means the rear passengers benefit from a flat floor. The Atto 2 will shop with two iterations of BYD’s battery tech; at launch it’ll use a powertrain with a 45.1kWh battery, a 194 mile range and a 130kW (174bhp) motor on the front axle. A long-range version will arrive soon after, though the specs – along with the pricing of both – have yet to be confirmed. Sales will start next month.

332,I ain’t afraid of no ghosts: making poltergeists in the Leapmotor C10,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/in-car-routines/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-02-19,Car Magazine UK,"Last week, I attended the UK launch of the new . While I was beetling around Sussex, I discovered the car had a ‘routines’ function that, once programmed, allows you to perform a series of actions, like you can with your Google nest at home. This has some serious benefits. For example, in the baking summer months, you can program the car to switch the air conditioning system to full blast the second your backside touches the driver’s seat. It saves you from faffing around with the touchscreen. The trouble is, Leapmotor’s parameters for the tech are – ahem – generous. You can use it to control basically anything on the car. Climate control. Stereo volume. Electric windows. Reading lights. The lot. And that opens some excellent opportunities for mischief. Because I’m a child, I spent the last half an hour of the launch event creating electrical gremlins in my C10 test car. And if you’re the poor sod at the Stellantis press garage trying to figure out why your brand-new Leapmotors are going haywire, sorry. My fault. Rather stupidly, I recorded the whole process – hence incriminating myself. You can watch it below. My goal was to make the car act like a knackered Italian motor from the 1980s so, every time someone sat in the passenger seat, I told the C10 to lower its rear right window, switch on the front left reading light and turn the radio volume to full. Off camera, I also created a routine that made C10 drop its rear right window every time you opened its driver’s door. I was in utter hysterics as I watched journalists and Leapmotor executives alike approach the car and then recoil in horror at the ‘demon’ possessing it. The process was made even funnier by Leapmotor’s slightly wonky Chinese translations. The touchscreen described the rear windows as being either ‘On’ or ‘Off’ rather than ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’ – and the front occupants could either be ‘Seated’ or ‘Not Seated.’ There’s even a menu that allows you to select the strength of the acceleration provided by the electric motor. The three options are ‘Smooth,’ ‘Stable’ and – wait for it – ‘Robust.’ I damn near fell out my ‘Seated’ position laughing at it. So, there you go. My quick guide on how to create your own poltergeist in a new Leapmotor. If you’ve got a mate who’s just bought a C10, feel free to use any info in here to wind them up.

333,Giulia ErreErre Fuoriserie: improving on perfection?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alfa-romeo/giulia-erreerre-fuoriserie/,Luke Wilkinson,2025-02-20,Car Magazine UK,"Italy has a rich coachbuilding history. There’s Zagato, Touring, Bertone and Carrozzeria to name but a few – and they’ve all produced some truly wonderful works of automotive art, each with their own unique personality. But every Italian coachbuilder has one thing in common. They all do their best work when their starting point for a project is an . Now, there’s another Italian design studio treading those same boards in the hope it can add its name to the greatest hits album. It’s called ErreErre Fuoriserie, which is a far more difficult name for me to wrap my mangled regional English around than . This is its first project – a modified version of the that’s been restyled to look like the 1962 Giulias the Italian police drove (badly) in I reckon it looks both gorgeous and gawky, depending on what angle you view it from. The front end is nothing short of perfection (especially when viewed from the three-quarter angle in the header image), but the proportions at the rear look a little clumsy to my eye. That’s probably because ErreErre Fuoriserie couldn’t modify the Giulia’s safety cell, as that would compromise its crash performance. As a result, those boxy retro body panels have been spaced off the Giulia’s curvy under structure, making the rear look a little wider than it should. But I digress, because my personal tastes pale into insignificance once you learn how much work goes into each car. It takes a total of 5,000 hours to design and manufacturer each car (or, to put that another way, 208 consecutive 24-hour days) – and it’s positively groaning under the weight of its craftsmanship. The bodywork, for example, is made entirely from hand finished carbon fibre, while the wheels are a recreation of the pepper-pot wheels fitted to the 1962 Giulia Tipo 105, sized up to 19 inches to help fill the car’s massive arches. Exhaust? It’s a custom-made centre-exit unit from Capristo Automotive. Suspension? That’s unique to the car as well, thanks to Bilstein. The brakes have also been uprated to Brembo Carbon Ceramic units – important because ErreErre Fuoriserie has extracted a bit more power from the Giulia’s engine. It produces 554hp and 502lb ft of torque, up from the 514bhp and 443lb ft of torque you get in the standard car. ErreErre Fuoriserie hasn’t supplied any performance specs (probably because the cars are far too expensive to risk crashing). But I reckon it’ll get from 0–62mph faster than an Italian barista can pour you an espresso. All this craftsmanship doesn’t come cheap, though. ErreErre Fuoriserie charges a staggering €310,000 (around £260,000) for each car – and that doesn’t include the cost of the donor car. If you want one, you need to supply your own. But if you’ve got that sort of cash rattling around in your bank account, you would. Wouldn’t you? I certainly would. I’ll have mine in red, please.

334,Polestar arithmetic: why the new boss is sticking with badge numbers – even though they make little sense,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/polestar/polestar-badges-and-names/,Tim Pollard,2025-02-21,Car Magazine UK,"The new boss of Polestar is sticking with the Swedes’ mildly illogical numbering system and ruled out any switch to names or new nomenclature. It all started out so logically: the brand’s first model was the plug-in hybrid and it was followed by the company’s first all-electric car, the . Everything made sense when the next duo were the 3 and 4 crossovers, which have arrived in the past 12 months. So far, so good. Chief executive officer has confirmed we will see the sporty new high-performance coupe in ‘the second half of 2025,’ but one of his first product changes has been to delay the Polestar 6 in favour of the – a new compact electric SUV designed to compete with the likes of the Tesla Model Y. ‘The Polestar 7 will come first,’ he told CAR. ‘I can’t confirm a date to you because we are working through the details. We have partners, we have a factory, all that needs to be decided. So the sequence will be – and I don’t love this – Polestar 5 this year, then comes the Polestar 7, and then the follows.’ Yes, essentially. The badging system was designed to follow the launch pattern, and that’s now been derailed by the 7 coming out before the 6. Lohscheller refuses to speculate on when the 6 will launch, suggesting it might have a much longer wait until later this decade. you may well ask – and you’re probably right. But to the casual observer, it means that Polestar’s range hierarchy is somewhat confusing. The numbers follow neither launch sequence nor product hierarchy, in the way that rational Audi or BMW usually manage with their logical badges. ‘In terms of the sequence, okay yes: 5, 7, 6… I give you that point,’ the CEO (above) concedes. ‘So you can write about that and so on. But otherwise, I think our naming system is perfect. I love how Polestar does it. It’s a new brand. I want everyone to know the brand. ‘Sometimes you have names of cars which are more famous than the brand name itself. I don’t know, some people say Astra is more famous than Opel, right? So always having Polestar and then the numbering, I think it’s perfect. It couldn’t be better.’ Lohscheller confirmed that the Polestar badging system will stick with today’s numbers, and not keep rising sequentially. ‘The Polestar 2 is here to stay,’ he revealed. ‘And then at some stage we will announce a successor. The Polestar 2 successor is not the 7. There will be a Polestar 2 successor and it will be called 2.’ When asked if Polestar numbers would keep spiralling upwards, the new boss pledged that would not happen and said the range numbers would remain in single digits. ‘I think the way it is at the moment is really good,’ he said. ‘So now we have a new addition, the compact SUV – we didn’t have that in the portfolio, so we call it the Polestar 7. But all cars coming afterwards, I would say we have the names already. So the next Polestar 2 will not be the Polestar 8. It will be the Polestar 2.’ Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

335,All aboard the gilded lifeboat of luxury,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/luxury-brands-and-cars/,Ged Maxwell,2025-02-24,Car Magazine UK,"For a brief period in time in 2023, a man called Bernard, who sells T-shirts, watches and fizzy wine, became the richest person in the world. His conglomerate, LVMH, which owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Möet and Fendi, performed so well on the Parisian stock exchange that it pushed its value up at the same speed as the Nasdaq – where shares in Apple, Microsoft and Amazon trade. Luxury is an irresistible commercial force. This is brilliant news for legacy automotive brands currently worried about China. The brute force of colossal, relatively cheap labour and vertically integrated production – all funded by lakes of state capital – has helped China become the world’s biggest vehicle exporter, its cars heading overseas by the boatload to disrupt the old order. Analysts from bank UBS think the Euro and US brands will lose a fifth of global market share by 2030. So, which direction should the old school carmakers take? Jaguar, makes no secret of the fact the main reason its new cars will sell for north of £100,000 is to put them beyond current Chinese competition. Bernard shone a bright golden light on the new western paradigm. Go luxe or go extinct. For more than a decade the likes of Rolls-Royce and Bentley have found that pushing upmarket is a gilded lifeboat helping them weather a multitude of storms, from worldwide financial collapse and a global pandemic to supply-chain crises and exit from the EU. If the rest of the world’s car makers are serious about luxury they could learn a lot from these UK-based players. And success starts by letting your clients run riot… The irony of wealth is that it becomes impossible to treat yourself. Which is why luxury customers no longer want just stuff; they want access to and influence within their favourite brands – to walk around like they own the place. Directing designers and whispering into the ears of CEOs is valuable. Bentley recently invited a handful of very special clients to meet and dine with senior management on the production line at Crewe. And such activities are exceptional for business. Aston Martin has Q Branch, Bentley has Mulliner and Rolls-Royce has Bespoke, all mini empires in their own right, where customers are not only let loose but encouraged to make outlandish requests – so long as their bank balance can back up the bravado. Bentley saw profits soar to a record £623.7 million in 2022, and in 2023 grew its custom operation by 43 per cent. While revenue for the first half of 2024, a more challenging period, was down on the previous year, €1.388bn isn’t too shabby. Neither is an 18.8 per cent return on sales. Rolls-Royce, a brand more coy about its profitability, delivered 6032 cars in 2023, with the average customer dropping more than €500,000 per car that year, well above the list price of its most expensive model. Aston and Bentley’s approach is mostly colour and trim, while also offering limited-run coachbuilt cars like the Bacalar, Batur and Valour, not to mention recreations of their classic icons. Rolls-Royce facilitates the full Roaring ’20s coachbuilt experience. These one-offs are an economic miracle – customers happily pay to fill the void between a designer’s wildest dreams and the accountants. The result is a customer-funded, roadgoing concept car. To give you an idea of budget, one coachbuilt Rolls-Royce was rumoured to cost £25 million. Dealerships are all well and good, but you need to be smart to capture the ‘ultra high net worth individuals’ – people with a net worth of at least $30 million. Ergo, the rise of the pop-up. From Saint Tropez to Savile Row, following the money has been an essential tool for Britain’s luxo titans to support both revenue and brand image. In addition to rocking up in places bristling with wealthy travellers, from Saint Moritz to the Côte d’Azur (where Rolls-Royce has summered), they use the pop-up model as a low-cost means to experiment with new markets and interact with their customers face to face. This flexibility is needed to respond to the speed with which luxury markets emerge. While supercar brands can be guilty of splashing their logo on questionable merch, a better-curated partnership can pay substantial dividends, and help elevate an automotive brand’s position as a luxo entity rather than a boring old car maker. Aston and Bentley have gone in on property, offering their brand to residential projects in Miami and Dubai. They’ve imported the tactic from Versace’s Palazzo Versace model, Bulgari’s Hotel & Residences scheme, and other similar property-luxe tie-ups. Rolls-Royce’s approach is softer. It infiltrates the monied world by funding emerging creatives through its art programme, Muse. If your brand enters the room hand-in-hand with creative talent, an audience of spenders might like you as much as they pretend to like art. There’s no word more powerful than ‘no’ to a rich person. Telling your customers they’re not allowed to buy your expensive new product is a time-served luxury play (see the Hermes Birkin bag, every attractive Rolex and a reservation at The Fat Duck). That’s why brands have different tiers of ownership. It begins with a hybrid of linked app and owners’ club. Bentley has the Bentley Network and Rolls-Royce has Whispers, both offering invitations to experiences, a concierge and the opportunity to chat to executives as well as other owners. Once you’ve got your car, shown your face on the app and turned up to a few showroom events, you might get invited to play on the next level: the limited-edition car. These tend to have more power, sleeker bodywork and off-menu features. They’re for existing customers only, and tend to cost between 40 and 100 per cent above RRP. Beyond that, the very top tier includes the possibility of a coachbuilt one-off. This is profitability squared. Exploiting your heritage is pretty standard practice for a car brand, but the luxo set has wised up to a key fact: the rich are getting younger. Today, the average age of Bentley’s customers in some regions is just 39. Crewe has extended its heritage fleet, promoting cars not just from the universally understood ‘classic’ period but the ’80s, ’90s and beyond – periods that resonate if you’re 39. But heritage comes with a catch – if you’re not careful, history can be the only place your brand belongs, which isn’t terribly appealing to the next generation of luxury consumer. So, Bentley rarely markets a new model finished in its traditional, subdued colour palette, preferring neon oranges, electric purples and nuclear greens. It also has a boosted and blacked-out Speed range, addressing its old-world associations head on and elbows out. Rolls-Royce has gone even further, aligning itself with ‘subversive’ customers who, according to the company, ‘reject suits for streetwear’ and ‘use blockchain not banks’ with its bad-boy Black Badge models. It works – the average age of an RR customer is just 42 worldwide, and the package (wheels, engine tune, carbon trim and a thorough de-chroming) is a circa-£40,000 option. Ker-ching.

296,Renault 5 and Alpine A290 announced as joint 2025 European Car of the Year winner,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/european-car-of-the-year-2025/,Jake Groves,2025-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"2025’s European Car of the Year has been announced: the and . This year’s European Car of the Year award was announced at the 2025 Brussels motor show. The pair of French electric cars have won the award as one, given their shared architecture and technology. Fabrice Cambolive, brand CEO for Renault, and Philippe Krief, brand CEO for Alpine both collected the award at the Brussels show. ‘We needed this to break the glass ceiling of EV adoption,’ says Cambolive during the awards ceremony. 2025’s contenders were, in order, the , / , , , , and Renault 5/Alpine A290 (which are being treated as a pair given their structural similarities). That was whittled down from a total of 42 contenders, which were all tested in September 2024 at the Tannistest centre in Denmark. A total of 60 jurors from 23 countries converged on the centre to test all of the entrants, with the final seven being chosen. Every juror gets a total of 25 points to award across all the finalist cars. Running through each country’s votes in the live broadcast, almost like the Eurovision results, the Renault 5/Alpine A290 grabbed an early lead and stayed there. The total results are as follows: : 353 points : 291 points : 215 points : 172 points : 168 points : 165 points : 136 points , marking only the second time in the ECotY award’s 60+ year history that a brand has won it twice on the bounce.

297,Toyota reveals mid-engined GR Yaris M Concept,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/gr-yaris-m-concept/,Seth Walton,2025-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"The Toyota GR Yaris is one of our favourite and last year’s update brought several key upgrades, but can you improve further on the already excellent? Toyota’s Gazoo Racing division reckons so. This is the GR Yaris M concept – a reimagined version of the coveted hot hatch with its engine mounted mid car, rather than in the front. Still under development, the engine itself has also been uprated: a 2.0-litre in-line four cylinder, as opposed to the 1.6-litre in-line three of the current road car. So, more power and more speed on the way, but a mid-mounting should also improve the car’s weight balance and thus its handling characteristics. Enticing stuff. Why the upgrade? Bit of a ‘why not?’, really. Toyota says it wants to explore the potential of the GR Yaris by entering the M Concept into Japan’s Super Taikyu– a multi-class, Pro/Am racing series. It wouldn’t be the marque’s first foray into the Super Taikyu, as a GR edition of the Corolla has previously been entered, but Toyota are going to the extremes in development this time. According to the manufacturer, the GR Yaris M Concept is currently under ‘driver-first’ development, throughout which concept examples are driven to death and then repaired repeatedly until the perfect example has been produced. A development mule of the GR Yaris M Concept is expected to take part in a few Super Taikyu races later this year. If the bigger-engine-in-the-middle-of-a-dinky-Toyota-hatch narrative sounds familiar, then it’s because Toyota has been at this lark before. Back in 2008, a reimagined edition of the Aygo was unveiled, featuring a turbocharged engine plucked from the Celica and the MR2, known as the The 1.8 VVT-I engine produced 200bhp – a 132bhp bump over the Aygo’s regular motor – but more interestingly, it was mounted in the middle of the car, turning the Aygo into a Japanese take on the Renault Clio V6. It was rear-wheel drive, featured the gearbox from the MR2, and Toyota claimed at the time that the Aygo Crazy would be able to knock off 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds. Sadly the model never emerged past the ‘crazy’ one-off concept phase. Hopefully, in the case of the GR Yaris M Concept, Toyota will take a leaf out of Renault’s book and allow people to take a few home. The Toyota GR Yaris M Concept will be on display at the Tokyo Auto Salon 2025, 10 Jan – 12 Jan.

298,Subaru’s latest WRX STI… has a CVT,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/subaru/sti-s210/,Jake Groves,2025-01-14,Car Magazine UK,"Subaru’s WRX STI still lives on, albeit in extremely small numbers. This is the S210 Prototype, a special edition of the current-generation WRX model. It’s just been unveiled at the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon. STI – or Subaru Tecnica International – has been hard at work with its latest ‘S’ series model, and has managed to tick all of the usual boxes when it comes to a Subaru performance car. Subaru says the latest S210 model ‘was developed by incorporating the technology and knowledge gained from the Nürburgring 24-hour race. So, let’s go through the checklist. Over the top bodykit? Yup. Splitters front and rear, wide side sills and bespoke 19-inch wheels shod in Michelin rubber are all present and correct – as is an enormous rear wing. Inside, properly serious-looking carbon-backed Recaro front seats are fitted. The S210 isn’t just for show, though. Subaru has fitted six-piston Brembo brakes up front with bespoke brake pads, and it features ‘specially tuned electronic control dampers and coil springs, and newly developed rear stabilizer bushes.’ All of this performance engineering is naturally designed to complement the powertrain. With the S210, a modified version of the ‘FA24’ turbocharged 2.4-litre flat-four engine is used, developing up to 297bhp and 277lb ft here. Subaru says it’s achieved these numbers by some new turbocharger components and a bespoke ECU. But here comes the interesting part, as the brand says that power is sent to the wheels via a Subaru Performance Transmission – code for Subaru’s own CVT. This is the first ‘S’ car to use one. Yikes. Subaru says that it has worked on its in-house CVT by ‘tuning the gearshift characteristics to match the engine output, with a high degree of controllability.’ The result is, apparently, ‘an extremely heightened pleasure of driving as the driver’s intentions are precisely transmitted to the car.’ Just 500 S210 models will be sold.

299,UK pricing for the Hyundai Inster Cross is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/inster-cross/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-14,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has revealed UK pricing of the Inster Cross, an off-road-inspired variant of the recently launched , Inster. The Cross will start at £28,745 on the road and be offered in just one trim. For context, that’s a chunk more than the basic 01 spec trim Inster’s £23,495, and just a touch more than the £26,745 asking price of the 02 trim. Like the 02 spec Inster, the Cross rolls on 17-inch alloy wheels, but also adds distinct front and rear bumpers for a more off-road look. Other standard features include heated front seats, cruise control and LED running lights. Just like in the Inster, Hyundai has also thrown in a heat-pump and battery heating system as standard as on the Cross, for improved mileage in winter months. Options include a Tech Pack, which offers Vehicle-to-Load functionality, an internal three pin socket and a Digital Key. The cross will be available in five exterior colours; Atlas White will cost you £300, Abyss Black £600, while two matte colours, Amazons Green and Aero Silver cost an additional £800. Natural Ivory is free. The Inster Cross showcases outdoor-inspired design touches both inside and out, while also offering the spacious interior and luggage capacity found in the standard Inster. Changes to the new model include chunkier rectangular bumpers, embossed black cladding, and skid plates, with roof racks also fitted as standard. Front and rear skid plates will also feature with side rocker panels. As for the interior, it only gets one significant change being the grey cloth upholstery with lime-yellow accents on the dashboard. Additionally, it offers the convenience of folding down all four seats and features a walk-through front cabin. Similarly, the mechanical setup remains unchanged, offering a choice of two single-motor electric powertrains. The entry-level option delivers 96bhp with a 42kWh battery, providing a claimed range of 186 miles. In contrast, the Long-Range version increases output to 113bhp and extends the range to 221 miles. The intster Cross can be charged from 10 to 80 per cent in around 30 minutes, when using a 120 kW DC charger.

300,Levelling up: Skoda reveals hefty Enyaq update,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/enyaq/,Seth Walton,2025-01-14,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda has confirmed prices for its heavily facelifted Enyaq. The and Coupe range kicks off with the SE L 60 as the entry-level trim, replacing the previous 50 badge. It puts the cost of entry for the Enyaq range at a competitive £39,000. However, opt for the top-of-the-range, all-wheel drive Sportline 85x Coupe and you’ll be paying £50,650. In between there’s the Edition 60 SUV (£40,100), the Edition 85 SUV (£44,300) and the four-wheel drive 85x SUV (£48,750). If you want something with a sportier silhouette, your cheapest route is the Edition 85 Coupé which costs £46,200. The range is capped off by the all-wheel-drive, long range, SportLine 85x Coupé which costs £50,650. The Edition 60 gets LED front and rear lights as standard, along with heated front seats as well as keyless entry and cruise control. Move to the longer range 85 car, and wireless charging with cooling is included as standard. Edition trims get Skoda’s more complex Matrix LED headlights and animated indicators, as well as an electrically adjustable driver’s seat with massage function. On the outside buyers also get a darker chrome trim for roof rails and other areas. The top of the range SportLine 85x rolls on larger 20-inch Vega black alloy wheels and matches them with gloss black highlights and sportier bumpers at the front and rear. The flagship model also gets a HUD as standard along with sports seats and a Canton-badged sound system. Keep reading for everything else you need to know about Skoda’s new Enyaq. This it the 2025 Skoda Enyaq – a substantial revision of the smash-hit Czech , with new styling, greater efficiency and more tech to keep you on the road as standard. When we say smash hit, we really mean it. Skoda caught a wave of electric SUV interest with the both the Enyaq Coupe and the full . Since their arrival in 2020, over 250,000 have been delivered, with 75,000 in 2024 alone – serious numbers, and a tale of success that the Cezch firm will want to continue for the next five years and beyond. So, the team has thrown the kitchen sink at the update. The 2025 Enyaq still sits on Volkswagen’s MEB platform, but it’s been considerably updated with enhanced numbers to match.Sound promising? Read on for everything you need to know about the new 2025 Skoda It’s pretty arresting, isn’t it. Skoda has dubbed the design of the Enyaq’s front end as Tech-Deck style, in keeping with the brand’s Modern Solid design language. That probably means, erm, something but the manifestation of ‘Modern Solid’ is quite distinctive in comparison to the face of the last Enyaq. The front end now comprises of a sleeker grille and dark chrome Skoda lettering in lieu of a logo above. It certainly looks the part of a revised e-SUV for 2025 – complete with in-vogue wispy-thin headlights and a lightbar, but the overall package is still recognisably Enyaq. What’s perhaps more interesting is the improvement in aerodynamic efficiency over the previous car. The 2025 Enyaq’s Modern Solid Tech-Deck face (we’ll get used to calling it that eventually) has a lower drag coefficient of 0.245, down from 0.256 accomplished by the last model. The Coupe Enyaq can go one better, with a drag coefficient of just 0.225 (0.234 for the old version). Skoda says this has been achieved by a smoother transition from the front end to the bonnet, aided by optimised air curtains and more aerodynamically efficient wheels. The result? Improved range figures, but we’ll get onto those later. No radical changes to the interior. It still looks about as spacious and minimalistic as the outgoing Enyaq, only now with a slightly revised steering wheel that features the SKODA name instead of a logo, just like on the bonnet. Boot space is unchanged between versions and so remains 585 litres in the Enyaq and 570 in the Coupe, but standard interior equipment is up in the new model. An advanced keyless entry/locking system, a heated steering wheel, heated front seats and three-zone climate control are now all included in all 2025 Enyaqs at no extra cost. Skoda’s Simply Clever QR code will also features in the 2025 Enyaq’s boot, through which owners can find out the best and most efficient way of stacking their luggage in the car. The 2025 Skoda Enyaq will be available as either a 60, an 85 or an 85x, with certain batteries and power units married to each. Either a 63kWh battery or an 82kWh battery may be fitted, while power outputs are split between 201bhp and 281bhp options. The Enyaq 60 is fitted with the lesser of both. The 60 and 85 versions will be rear-wheel drive only, but the range-topping 85x edition will feature all wheel drive. Want to maximise on range? Opt for the standard 85 Coupe model – it has a quoted maximum range of up to 370 miles. Official UK prices are yet to be released, but we expect it should start from around the £39,000 mark. Order books are set to open later in the year. We’ll confirm back here as and when it goes on sale in the UK.

301,Dacia's supersized Bigster family SUV priced from £25k; tops out at £30k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/dacia/bigster/,Jake Groves,2025-01-15,Car Magazine UK,"Dacia’s new Bigster SUV has finally arrived. The covers came off at the and Dacia has just announced a sucker punch: the new Bigster will be priced from £24,995. The large family SUV is 4.57 metres long, so will naturally be going up against cars like the oh-so-popular , and , as well as the five-seat . ‘Obviously there is so much competition, but Dacia does things a bit differently,’ smiles Patrice Levy-Bencheton, Dacia’s VP for product performance. ‘We still believe there’s room for a value proposition here, and we want to systematically have the best value-for-money offer in the market. Our goal with Bigster is to do exactly that again – it’s the natural Dacia way.’ This is Dacia’s first entrant into the ‘C-segment’ of the car market – one of the most, if not *the* most competitive part of the car market in Europe. The brand has , with brand boss Denis Le Vot telling CAR that the brand will offer two more new C-segment models, but will ‘be more imaginative’ than just selling two more SUVs. Anyway, the Bigster is a big deal, promising to shake up the family SUV market with its big space and big value offer. Want to know more? We’ve been given one-on-one access to the Bigster and the brains behind it. Well, . The clue’s in the name – it’s almost designed to be a bigger – and we’ve all sort of known what the car was going to look like after we saw the concept version in 2021. Still though, this is a bold looking thing – quite possibly the boldest a Dacia has ever looked. ‘We’re making something that’s meant to be robust and last the test of time here,’ says design director, David Durand. ‘We’re not making a hugely dynamic or aggressive car, it’s a question of balance.’ But there are a few key differences with Bigster. The biggest visual differences are the wheelbase and that bulky rear end; the former is proof of Dacia’s efforts to stretch the Renault Group CMF-B platform to its absolute limit, while the latter is designed to maximise rear headroom and boot space. There are some new details never seen on a Dacia before. New 19-inch wheels are available on the top trips and check out the two-tone paint – a black roof coupled with a new Indigo Blue colour is a first for the brand. Think of it as something a little more mature to go with bolder terracotta oranges and khaki greens. And the two-tone black roof is literally printed onto the car, speeding up the usual process of painting two-tone colours. ‘It’s this new technology we’re introducing that, yes, is a lot like an ink printer,’ says Levy-Bencheton. ‘You can be so precise with the pigmentations of the paint with this robot we’re using, and it ends up being more than half the cost of the old way.’ ‘It also means just one round of paint protection coating, so you end up with around the same energy consumption as applying a single paint colour,’ adds Durand. ‘It opens up so many possibilities for us.’ The Bigster’s interior naturally features plenty of details seen in other Dacia and Renault Group models. It’s clean and neat inside, with a large, thick-rimmed steering wheel and a few new design elements exclusive to the Bigster. The most obvious is a rather high centre console, offering a very different kind of interior vibe to the smaller Duster. ‘This high centre console one of the main calling cards of something in the C-segment,’ says interior design chief, Magali Gouraud. ‘It’s so much more ergonomic this way and gives you plenty of bonus interior storage you wouldn’t get otherwise.’ As well as the same size infotainment screen seen on both the Spring EV and new Duster, the Bigster benefits from the brand’s YouClip mounting points that launched with the new Duster, offering accessories that allow you to ‘bring a bit of your own life into the car,’ says Gouraud (pictured above). Points are located on the dashboard and on the inside of the tailgate, and one is located at the end of the centre console for the rear passengers to use. Plenty of other accessories can be bought, too, including useful storage solutions for those in the rear. The Bigster will be available in Dacia’s traditional trim variants, starting with Essential, rising through Expression to Journey (pictured in blue) and Extreme (pictured in grey) – the two top trims that offer either loads of equipment or focus on being prepared for anything. New firsts inside include electric seats and a powered tailgate. Upper variants will also benefit from a Neoprene-like seat upholstery trimmed with a breathable lightweight fabric inspired by Adidas’ Primeknit and Nike’s Flyknit. Given this thing’s bigger than a Duster, there’s a much larger second row – my 6’2” self has sat in the back behind my driving position and there’s loads of space. Dacia also offers 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats on most versions. ‘We should also have the best boot space volume in the C-SUV market,’ says Bigster program lead, Ludovic Dupont, with the 600 litres of space (from floor to parcel shelf) being a little more than Citroen’s C5 Aircross and way more than any other car this size bar the Kodiaq. Neat details add to the car’s usability, too – there are moulds in the central rear seat that, when folded down, offer cupholders and device holders. The adjustable boot floor has a second use as a luggage divider. Roof racks are neatly integrated into the rails, meaning you don’t have to buy a set to fit and, like the and Duster, the Bigster will benefit from Dacia’s . It is, however, only a five-seater. Durand says if the team had made it able to seat seven, it would have compromised weight as well as the car’s design and aerodynamics – something the team weren’t prepared to do, particularly given it has the Jogger in the range. Three are offered. The base version uses a mild hybrid three-cylinder petrol engine, two-wheel drive and a manual gearbox. That can be upgraded to an auto with four-wheel drive. ‘And that’s a 4×4!’ smiles Levy-Bencheton as he takes subtle pot shots at the . ‘We’re not talking about some ‘extended grip’ function like on some C-segment SUVs.’ The real newbie, though, is the Bigster Hybrid. It, again, uses Renault E-Tech Hybrid technology, but this time deploys the more powerful 153bhp model in a Dacia for the first time. Dacia is also continuing to offer its LPG-infused BiFuel variant in markets that’ll accept it. Dacia has finally announced pricing for the Bigster, and it’s even beaten our predictions. The new five-seat family SUV will be priced from £24,995 in the UK for a basic TCe 140 Expression model. Your cheapest hybrid model will start at £27,995. If you want plusher Journey trim, prices start at £26,245 and for Extreme trim, you’ll need at least £26,495. Interestingly, the most you can spend on a Bigster right out of the box is under £30k. All of these numbers mean the Bigster is tied for being the cheapest car in its class alongside the latest MG HS, undercutting the likes of the and Skoda Kodiaq.

302,Aston Martin Vantage Roadster blows in: a 656bhp bi-turbo V8 alfresco thriller,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/vantage-roadster/,Tim Pollard,2025-01-15,Car Magazine UK,"Launching just in time for summer 2025, it’s the new open-top Aston Martin Vantage Roadster – and it does exactly what it says on the tin. The British manufacturer has a long history of chopping the top off its sports cars and the first rung up the Aston ownership ladder, the Vantage, has now succumbed to the tin-opener. It’s essentially an with the roof removed for alfresco thrills and posing power aplenty. Launching in the second quarter of 2025, you can see (and hear) the convertible in action in the official launch video above. The 4.0-litre Mercedes-AMG V8 has never sounded as good… It’s front-engined and rear-wheel drive, naturally, and the key headline outputs are pretty mind-boggling, the more so when you consider this is Aston Martin’s open-top sports car: It’s worth noting that roof operation time; Aston claims it’s the ‘fastest electric folding convertible roof on sale today, opening or closing fully in just 6.8 seconds, and at speeds of up to 31mph.’ It means you can flip from coupe protection (from sunshine or rain) to open-top thrills in a jiffy, giving occupants the greatest chance to enjoy the weather – and the sonorous sound of that twin-turbocharged V8. Gaydon claims that the roof, electric motors and extra bracing add 60kg to the overall kerbweight of the new 2025 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster (total mass: 1665kg, dry). The styling, honed at the Gaydon design centre in Warwickshire, England, is exactly as you’d expect. It takes the shape of the latest Vantage family and deftly replaces the metalwork above with a shape so elegant and clean that you just know the coupe and soft-top convertible were designed in tandem from the outset. To these eyes, Aston Martin design has got it just right: it’s butch, purposeful and elegant all at once, without being too shouty. Aston Martin Lagonda design director Miles Nurnberger talks of athletic style, or a ‘brute in a suit’, and we’d say they’ve hit the bullseye with the Vantage Roadster. Owners can pick from an array of design upgrades, including privacy side glass, extra carbonfibre detailing, pinstripe liveries and gloss black upper body packages. The 4.0-litre twin-turbo is carried over from the coupe, meaning performance is destined to be strong. Peak power output stands at 656bhp at 6000rpm while the torque mountain swells to 590lb ft all the way from 2750-6000rpm, enabling those outrageous performance claims. That flat torque curve indicates brutal acceleration available across the rev range. The V8 is mounted far back in the front engine bay, allowing Aston to claim it’s ‘front-mid-mounted’, to improve the weight distribution. Furthermore, the eight-speed automatic transmission is mounted on the transaxle at the back and the propshaft is lightweight carbonfibre, helping to give car more balance. The Aston Martin Vantage Roadster is 4495mm long, 2124mm wide (including mirrors) and just 1285mm high. Suspension is by double wishbones up front, and the rear wheels are suspended by a multi-link arrangement. Aston Martin’s Adaptive Damping System uses Skyhook technology to soften or stiffen response, depending on the road surface and the driver commands. Choose from the following modes: Wet, Sport, Sports Plus, Track and Individual. Twenty-one inch alloy wheels are standard: 275/35 ZR21 Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 AML tyres up front, whopping 325/30 ZR21 at the rear. Owners can choose to upgrade to Michelin’s Pilot Alpin 5 AML winter rubber if they wish. Aston is adamant the new Vantage Roadster is an everyday proposition. We’ve driven the coupe extensively and can vouch for its ease of use. The two-seater cabin is snug and purposeful, with comfortable seats and – finally – infotainment that’s up to the job. If you need +2 rear seats, upgrade to the instead. The Vantage soft-top has a 200-litre boot and 78-litre fuel tank. You’ll be filling the latter quite regularly, thanks to a 23mpg combined fuel consumption figure (worse if you enjoy all 656bhp, we suspect). CO2 emissions stand at a lofty 279g/km.

303,AMG boss: ‘We have lost V8 customers’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mercedes-benz/amg-boss/,Ted Welford,2025-01-16,Car Magazine UK,"Downsizing the engines of performance cars is never a crowd pleaser, but few decisions have proved quite so unpopular as Mercedes-AMG ditching the C63’s V8 and replacing it with a four-cylinder plug-in hybrid. Affalterbach could have gone down the six-cylinder route, as BMW and Audi have done with their respective and RS4 rivals, and AMG has found other hybrid solutions on different models. But for the C63 it opted for a hybrid with the same cylinder count as your typical C300e company car, albeit a much more complex and powerful powertrain. Rumour has it that former AMG boss Tobias Moers walked out of a meeting when it was decided to make the switch. The man whose mission is to navigate a way through the turbulence is Michael Schiebe, who’s worked for Mercedes since the start of his career in 2004 and been AMG boss since March 2023. He’s also responsible for G-Class and Maybach. A busy man, though he finds time to chat to CAR at the reveal of the AMG GT 63 Pro. The first international reviews of the C63 in late 2022 were nothing more than lukewarm, and it’s not been received any more warmly now that it’s been tested on UK roads. Our own James Dennison described the new C63 as a ‘mere shadow of what this great brand is capable of.’ Schiebe admits the PHEV has lost AMG some loyal fans, but believes it was the right choice for the car. ‘The C63 is a very important car in our portfolio. It used to be, it is and it will be. We decided with the current version to really go for the latest technology. We wanted something new and that’s why we put the F1 powertrain into a street-legal car. ‘We see that some of our very loyal customers struggle a bit with the concept. Of course, no doubt we have also lost some customers who are just into V8s,’ he concedes. ‘You need to really drive this car. It’s a very convincing product.’ Schiebe is obsessed with technology and pushing boundaries of performance. But isn’t there a worry that the core sensation and audible excitement of what has historically made AMGs so entertaining is being lost, and that it’s not what its customers actually want? ‘We jumped far ahead with this technology, but we should have explained the technology more to our salespeople and customers. We will continue to do that and further improve. There is a German saying, “You never have a second chance at a first impression.” Maybe we missed out on the first impression, but if you have the opportunity, I’m sure you will be convinced of the technology.’ Like other performance-car makers, AMG is holding back from putting all of its eggs in one basket. Schiebe says the plan is ‘all kinds of drivetrain technology, from ICE to hybrid to EV’. AMG’s first bespoke electric model is well on its way, evidenced by testing shots seen earlier this year. Though heavily disguised, it’s clearly a similar shape to the AMG GT 4-Door, and will go up against the and Lotus Emeya. It’s based around a platform called AMG.EA. Schiebe says the car will be an ‘AMG first and electric car second’. Schiebe won’t go into much detail about the AMG.EA platform, other than noting that the firm is targeting continued success in the upper segments of the market – as well as four-door GTs. He adds that electric AMGs must not ‘quickly lose steam’ with sustained high-speed runs, and that they must be able to charge quickly to get back on the road or track. But while other car makers are dialling down the speed of their switch to electric, including Mercedes-Benz as a whole, Schiebe is adamant electric is the future. ‘While we will continue to invest in ICE engines with no end date, we will not slow down the pace [of electrification]. I’m very positive about the all-electric future for AMG. This new technology provides so much opportunity for us – you can do many new things that you can’t do with a combustion engine today.’ AMG doesn’t have Porsche and Ferrari’s faith in ; they might help keep current cars viable for longer, but they’re not the plan. ‘We are completely going into an all-electric future. It’s unbeatable.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
304,How are Dacias so cheap? Meet the secretive super-group keeping costs low and smart-thinking high,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/dacia/design-to-cost/,Jake Groves,2025-01-16,Car Magazine UK,"Deep within the bowels of Dacia’s design and engineering offices, a cabal of the brand’s high-ranking executives regularly convene. But, whether at Renault Group’s evil villain lair-like Technocentre or at Dacia’s super-modern Design Centre in Bucharest, these meetings aren’t about picking the next president or hiding the existence of aliens. Instead, this ‘design-to-cost’ super-group is the key to how Dacia has kept its cars at a distinctly lower price point than many of its competitors. A handy approach, then, when you sell cars in regions currently being blighted by various cost of living crises. Food, fuel and interest rises (to name just three) have hugely damaged our finances. And that’s before you get to the fact that the ‘cheap’ car as we know it is dead; in 2024, you’ll need £20k just to get a key to a supermini. Want a useful family bus? You’re likely looking at something north of £35k. And yet… look at . Its entry price of £24,995 makes it the cheapest family SUV for the family on sale in the UK – albeit tied with – and its flagship model clocks in at under £30k. That sub-£30k price tag for a fully-loaded Bigster includes big car tech like electric seats, a panoramic glass roof, powered tailgate and has a hybrid powertrain. This isn’t the latest example, either. A supermini can be had for around £14k. The entry price of the deeply desirable and funky new is £6k less than a much smaller . Similarly priced choices for a seven-seater to a sub-£19k are lumpy, frumpy vans. The design-to-cost process is utterly obsessive for those involved. ‘It’s something we do right at the top level,’ says Patrice Levy-Bencheton (pictured above, left), the brand’s product performance vice president and key member of the DTC team. ‘Normally, you would design a part and create a specification for suppliers to run to, and then pick the best part for the lowest price you can. But we do it the other way around – we set a cost, then go to suppliers to see who can match it. We’re fighting for every five or 10 cents, but small rivers help make larger ones.’ But this shadowy supergroup isn’t just there to set challenging supplier targets. Its main role is to meet and discuss new materials and ways of manufacturing parts, or think of methods of how to slim down the number of steps to make them. When they succeed, doing so could save weight, manufacturing time, cost – or any combination of the three. It’s all very holistic and human. The ideas generated haven’t been the result of some AI algorithm having data fed into it, but of a team of real people that can respond to trends or fresh ideas quickly. ‘We meet every week and it’s quite easy to just sit around the table and discuss ideas,’ David Durand, Dacia’s design chief, tells us. ‘One example is when we decided to stop using chrome in our cars. Chrome used to be used to stop a steel part rusting, but now we just put it on top of plastic which is unnecessary [and bad for the environment]. In a big car company, that decision would have taken two years – we made it in 10 minutes.’ This thinking led to the introduction of the ‘Starkle’ recycled plastic material used since the Manifesto concept of 2022. It’s a durable but cheap material that’s left unpainted, designed to show off its interesting colour and keeping it cheap to make and replace. Since the concept car, Starkle has been deployed on the latest Duster and features on the Bigster. Other details on the new Bigster are the result of the DTC team’s efforts. Those luxuries like a powered tailgate and electric seats have been given a Dacia onceover; the electric seats still run on manual rails (only reclining and lumbar is electronically controlled), and the tailgate uses just one powered strut rather than two, saving weight and cost. ‘Half the cost, but still 100 per cent of the value,’ smiles Levy-Bencheton. Bigsters all have LED headlights, ‘but full LED headlights are expensive,’ says Durand (pictured above, centre), ‘so we only give the low beam LED and keep the high beam halogen. That means you get a lower price of the component but keep the cool effect most of the time.’ The rear lighting, meanwhile, has the same smart thinking; ‘we at Dacia never use lights attached to the tailgate,’ says Durand, highlighting the legal requirement to always have visible brake lights even when the tailgate is open. Some car makers get around that by adding extra lighting in other locations, ‘but that means double everything: double the wires, bulbs, LED components… we’ve said no to that,’ he scoffs. ‘We can make a very attractive and robust car with only one set of lamps that stretch out of the body side.’ Then there’s that dual-tone paint colour – usually a step in the manufacturing process that’s slow, expensive and inefficient for most car makers. That doesn’t sound very essential for a brand that’s all about the basics, does it? ‘No, it’s not essential, but we got so much positive feedback from potential customers that we found a great solution,’ says Levy-Bencheton. ‘Usually, the process in the plant would be to paint the body, then to protect all of the lower parts with masking tape done by hand. That takes time and costs a lot because you’re slowing down production…’ ‘And you have to heat the paint up twice!’ Durand jumps in. ‘That’s one of the most energy consuming processes in a car factory!’ Instead, Dacia prints the top black layer. Yes: it. ‘It’s this new technology we’re introducing that, yes, is a lot like an ink printer,’ smiles Levy-Bencheton. ‘You can be so precise with the pigmentations of the paint with this robot we’re using, and it ends up being more than half the cost of the old way.’ ‘It also means just one round of paint protection coating, so you end up with around the same energy consumption as applying a single paint colour,’ adds Durand. ‘It opens up so many possibilities for us.’ Naturally, Dacia’s team hopes that – because of its cost-saving efforts – that means more growth for the brand across Europe. UK figures have already shown that Dacia’s sales have increased by around 10 per cent between 2023 and 2024, up to 31,457 units – that’s set to rise with the launch of the Bigster and . European sales, meanwhile, were up 2.7 per cent in 2024 and the Sandero retained its place as the best-selling car in Europe. ‘[Car] prices have been increasing by around 50 per cent since 2020, but the revenue and purchasing power of the consumer has only increased by 10 per cent,’ says Levy-Bencheton. ‘So, in the end, there’s a real stretch between what they used to be able to get back then and what they can afford today. We intend to provide a new answer and a market for those customers.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

305,The Alpina B8 GT is a tribute to the firm’s founder,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpina/b8/,Ted Welford,2025-01-16,Car Magazine UK,"has unveiled the B8 GT as its most powerful car ever and its last car before it becomes . The B8 is the next in the line of BMWs to get the ‘GT’ treatment as a final hurrah to the brand as we know it, and follows on from the B5 GT and B3 GT. Alpina says it’s a tribute to its late founder Burkard Bovensiepen. Just 99 will be produced, costing from €225,000 (£190,000) in Germany. Alpina was founded 60 years ago by Burkard Bovensiepen and became officially recognised as a standalone manufacturer since 1983. Renowned for working on fine-tuning BMWs with more power, discreet sporty styling and interior upgrades, it’s carved out a niche market and is highly respected in the automotive world. With BMW soon to be taking full control of Alpina, the B8 GT is seen is the end of its current era. The B8 GT starts out life as a and then is heavily upgraded both mechanically and cosmetically. The Alpina B8 was first revealed back in 2021 but has now had a host of changes to make it the GT. Key to this is its 4.4-litre bi-turbo V8 being fettled to produce 625bhp and 630lb ft of torque – up 13bhp and 37lb ft. It not only makes it the most powerful version of the 8 Series yet but also the joint most powerful Alpina ever alongside the B5 GT. The 0-62mph sprint takes just 3.3 seconds and flat out it can hit 205mph. Did someone say perfect autobahn car? The improved figures come from new flow-optimised airboxes and the resulting improved boost pressure, as well as a revised throttle response and power delivery. The eight-speed ZF auto ‘box has also been revised for its greater torque and for quicker launches. Alpina isn’t all about just extra power and leaving it at that, so other revisions include a more rear-biased torque distribution and a revised suspension setup that aims to bring greater differentiation between the Comfort, Sport and Sport+ driving modes. The sports exhaust has also been fettled with a new centre silencer for a more ‘nuanced, sportive sound’. At first glance the B8 GT doesn’t look all that different to a standard Alpina B8, but there are various changes when you know where to look. There are lots of new carbon-fibre elements, including the air ducts and the front diffuser. Alpina’s trademark forged alluminium alloy wheels are present and finished in a new satin finish. Subtle Alpina lettering completes the look, while the door sills feature Burkard Bovensiepen’s signature. What isn’t so subtle is the slightly wild two-tone paint finish made up of Alpina Blue or Alpina Green combined with Black Sapphire paint. Just 20 of the 99 B8 GTs being produced will be painted in this bi-colour finish. Moving inside, the B8 GT gets a full leather and Alcantara interior available in four colours and with signatures of Alpina’s founder in the front seats. You’ll notice a theme here. Wood interior trim, an Alpina staple, is standard and each car comes with two bespoke Alpina weekend bags. It also comes with a specially designed chronograph from Swiss watchmaker Carl F. Bucherer with an integrated Alpina logo within it. Just 99 of these are being produced, one for every car. . However, because of a long-standing cooperation between Alpina and BMW, last signed in late 2020 and lasting for five years, Alpina will continue to be a standalone brand until the end of 2025. Since the 2022 announcement, few further details have been announced and it’s unknown as to how the company will operate when integrated directly within BMW. However, the firm has said that Alpina’s operations will continue at its home of Buchloe, an hour west of Munich, in the ‘long term’. BMW added at the time: “There will be no changes to the existing aftersales cooperation. As part of a strategic cooperation between the two companies, there will be a further expansion of the existing development services business for BMW out of Buchloe.” Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
306,"Digital driving licence set to launch this year, promising major impact for millions of Britons",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/digital-driving-licence/,Paula Cullington,2025-01-20,Car Magazine UK,"Digital driving licences could be launched this year, with mobile phone access, as experts weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the scheme. The digital licence will be accessible through a government app in a virtual wallet, rather than being integrated into existing Google or Apple wallets. It could be accepted as a form of ID for buying alcohol, voting, or boarding domestic flights. To address security concerns, the app will incorporate advanced authentication measures similar to those used in banking apps, including biometrics and security codes, and will only be accessible to the licence holder. Additionally, users will have the option to hide personal details, such as their home address, when needed — a convenient touch. Physical licences will still be issued, but ministers see the voluntary digital option as a way to ‘bring government into the 2020s,’ according to . The DVLA’s move brings it into the realm of technological progress, although it’s trailing behind countries like Australia, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and some US states, where similar systems are already in place. The new digital licence is expected to be introduced later this year, according to the Times. For now, digital licences will be entirely optional, running alongside traditional plastic cards. This gives motorists the flexibility to choose whichever format suits them best while ensuring those who prefer physical licences or lack access to smartphones aren’t left behind. Further details on the launch date, availability, and how the rollout will work are expected soon.

307,"Alpine A290 electric hot hatch pricing starts at £33,500 - is this the biggest bargain of 2025?",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a290/,Jake Groves,2025-01-21,Car Magazine UK,"The Alpine A290 is available to order in the UK now, priced from an attractively reasonable £33,500. There are five trim levels at launch and two power outputs – so if you want 217bhp rather than the basic 178bhp you’ll need to find another £2500. Finance pricing looks keen, too, with the entry-level Alpine A290 GT available from £345 a month with a £5,054 deposit (though that is limited to 6000 miles a year, with APR at 2.9 per cent). What’s more, if you order before 4 February 2025, Alpine is throwing in a choice of ‘VIP experiences’ as part of the deal; choose between an A110 track drive, access and hospitality at a number of UK events Alpine is appearing at, or an Alpine F1 tour at the firm’s Formula 1 facility in Enstone. Check out our to see if this quirky little ripper might be for you. Or keep reading for more spec and pricing details. While the A290 still looks very much like the it’s based on, we assure you there’s a lot more going on under the bodywork. Unveiled at Le Mans 2024, Alpine’s new A290 has officially arrived and – in the words of Ron Burgundy – it’s Kind Of A Big Deal. The A290 is an all-new car for Alpine in a segment it’s not had a toe in for some time, it’s the brand’s first battery-electric car and the first car of its upcoming ‘Dream Garage’ that includes an . Were you expecting anything different, given the teasers and the A290β concept? Like the R5, info about this thing has been teased, drip-fed and hinted at for years. So, in the end, the design isn’t really that much of a surprise. Still, the design team – led by VP of design Antony Villain – have put effort into making this feel like an Alpine, not a Renault. The A290 is 60mm wider than the R5, with more aggressive bumpers and square DRLs designed to look like rally foglamps, complete with cross motifs to echo the tape stretched across headlights. As well as an alloy wheel design that’s pretty much exactly the same as the one seen on the A290β concept, another wheel design is – according to Villain – designed to look like snowflakes. Because Alpine – geddit? The chunks taken out of the rear doors, too, are meant to be a nod to the A110 – Villain calls it the ‘Alpine Swoosh.’ Colour co-ordination is nice and simple, with a reworked version of the brand’s Alpine Blue. Villain says the new version is ‘an updated version with new pigments that are deeper and stronger. So it’s the same colour, but the effect is much stronger than before – this version will be the colour we use on all future Alpines.’ Grey and black are also available, as is a white colour scheme designed to ape the A290β concept for the A290’s limited-run, 1955-example Premiere Edition. Again, quite a lot of R5-ness in here, but the differences are just as noticeable as the exterior. The A290 benefits from the R5’s large digital instrument cluster and central infotainment screen, physical climate controls and slightly retro dashboard design. But the A290 benefits from bespoke infotainment and instrument graphics (including triangular power and speedometers that raise as they increase, bespoke animations and more) and DNR buttons like an A110 in the centre console. Upholstery quality has been taken up a notch (over the already-very-nice R5’s materials) to include an attractive dual-tone Nappa leather option, and an optional audio system designed and engineered by French audio specialists Devaliet. The most noticeable detail about the interior, though, is the steering wheel. Alpine’s engineers tenuously link it to the wheel seen on an F1 car, with details like an ‘OV’-spec overtake button for short e-boost stretches and a blue dial to change the amount of regen easily. Well, CAR’s early intel was correct regarding battery size – 52kWh – and where the e-motor’s come from: the . Interestingly, though, Alpine is introducing two power variants here: 178bhp or 217bhp. is 236 miles for the lower-power model – not brilliant, but not Abarth 500e cack, either – with the more powerful version knocking that back slightly to 226 miles per charge. The lower power variant can sprint 0-62mph in 7.4 seconds and tops out at 99mph, with the higher power version clocking in at 6.4 seconds before reaching a max speed of 105mph. For reference, a Mini Cooper S Electric takes 6.7sec to reach 62mph, while Abarth’s 500e claims a seven-second sprint. Both models use a single e-motor on the front axle, and utilise the same reasonably lightweight Ampr Small platform as the R5; Alpine quotes a weight figure of 1479kg. Your charging options are 11kW AC or 100kW DC and, like the R5, the A290 features vehicle-to-load and vehicle-to-grid functionality. We asked at the reveal in June 2024 whether Alpine would ever do a twin-motor, all-wheel drive model for a higher power output. CEO Philippe Krier smiled and said: ‘not yet.’ In December the same year, Renault unveiled the mad, limited edition , a wild rear-wheel drive variant with 500bhp… You assume wrong, dear reader. This is where the A290 gets interesting, and where you can breathe a sigh of relief. ‘We took the platform and changed everything we could around it,’ says A290 project lead, Charlie Biardeau. ‘If you go back a few decades, [Alpine founder] Jean Rédélé was doing just that. He used to race in a 4CV but changed the engine, added a five-speed gearbox, uprated the suspension and even changed it to have a three-door fibreglass body – and that became the Alpine A106.’ With the A290, an entirely different, all-aluminium front subframe is used compared to the R5, and that 60mm increase in width has been achieved via completely different suspension knuckles and wider wheels. ‘It also features unique suspension with hydraulic bump stops similar the A110,’ says Sovany Ang, Alpine’s product performance VP, ‘as well as new anti-roll bars, Brembo brakes from the A110 with 320mm discs and exclusive tyres from Michelin.’ Brake-by-wire enables Alpine’s engineers ‘to get really natural brake feel, like in an A110,’ ride and handling engineer, Quentin Verheeke, tells CAR – but it will still including strong regenerative braking functionality controlled via that chunky blue dial on the steering wheel (and includes a coasting function). The ‘OV’ button has push-and-hold functionality, effectively acting like a brief Sport mode boost (when not already in Sport) and is designed for – you guessed it, F1 fans – overtaking. One of the big focuses has been sound, too. The A290 introduces the Alpine Driving Sound – something the brand’s engineers have spent a serious amount of time on to make it feel authentic (and not half-arsed, like Abarth’s). ‘The easy way would have just been to reproduce an engine sound,’ says Alpine CEO Philippe Krief, ‘but this uses noises from the electric motors.’ We’re shown demos of the sound in action as an A290 zips around a test track and note that there are different versions – one that includes a growl and digital whooshing noises combined, and another that’s more muted – and that the noise builds naturally with speed. It even reacts to throttle inputs and grip levels. Not so hard then, is it Abarth? And that’s not all. Aside from BMW’s ‘drift analyser,’ how many cars can you say challenge you to improve your driving skills on the road and on track? The A290 does. Aside from an Alpine-specific overlay of Renault’s OpenR infotainment, Alpine’s software team have included a huge telematics program that includes a G-meter that includes times when the ABS or traction control have been activated, and a lap timer for track driving. The coaching section covers everything from the basics of the A290 right up to getting the best drifting angle or using the driver monitoring system to ensure you’re looking where you need to when hunting for an apex. There are even 15 challenges the car sets for you – almost like the driving school in – that include clocking the fastest 0-62mph time or achieving the shortest braking distance to more calm and considered ones such as achieving the best mile per kWh efficiency figure. There are four standard specifications of A290 available at launch, plus a limited special edition. Base-spec GT and more luxurious GT Premium use the lower-power 178bhp electric motor, and roll out of the factory with Michelin Pilot Sport EV tyres. GT Performance and top-spec GTS benefit from the more potent 217bhp e-motor and Michelin Pilot Sport 5S rubber. The Premiere Edition pictured above is based on the GTS, adds various blue details and a Driving Pack, and is limited to 1955 examples. Priced from £33,500, even GT models include a 10.0-inch infotainment system with built-in nav, full LED headlights, 19-inch alloys, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging and two-tone roof. At £36,000, GT Premium adds two-tone Nappa leather, premium audio, blue brake calipers and different bi-colour roof. The faster GT Performance is based on the GT, gets red brake calipers, telematics, black detailing and more intricate non-leather interior upholstery, and also costs £36,000. GTS is based on the GT Premium and gains black wheels, telematics, black detailing and lumbar adjustment and is priced from £37,500. The Premiere Edition costs £38,500. UK order books are open now.

309,New Polestar chief calls for more design swagger: ‘The Americans don’t like too much understatement’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/polestar/polestar-design-mission-more-swagger-less-understatement/,Tim Pollard,2025-01-22,Car Magazine UK,"With a new CEO and design chief installed at late last year, it should come as no surprise that a new styling manual is being written in Gothenburg – and the chief has told CAR that he wants to inject more swagger into his Swedish EVs’ fashion sense. The new chief executive of Polestar, Michael Lohscheller, took the reins on 1 October and has already challenged the design team to make the range more noticeable. ‘The brief I gave Philipp Römers, our new design chief, is that what Polestar has done in the past, I think is really, really good. I want to highlight the performance element even more because that’s where the Polestar brand is coming from. ‘And I also want to also show it in a more confident way, if that makes sense to you. That doesn’t necessarily mean more colours. More paint choice drives complexity. But you know what? Polestar is sometimes a bit modest, a bit too humble. In several markets, like in Scandinavia, this works but I would like a little bit more confidence.’ Lohscheller (above) joins Polestar after a career working in senior financial roles at Opel, Volkswagen and Mitsubishi. This is not a major overhaul, more a development of a successful wardrobe, Lohscheller said in one of his first interviews since becoming CEO. ‘I would say: don’t expect a big radical change. That will not happen, but it’s a continuation of things… I want a bit more confidence, but I also want to highlight this performance element more, because cars like the really is an SUV as a sports car. ‘We have to work on that. It’s a fine line. Too much understatement is too much. In the US the Americans don’t like too much understatement.’ With development work pretty much complete on the and – the next two models in the pipeline, both of which have already been shown as concepts (above) – it looks like the job of signalling to the world the future Polestar design DNA will fall to the , a compact electric crossover expected in 2027 or 2028.

It’s designed to tackle the likes of the , as well as sporty EVs like the and . The Lyriq-V uses a dual-motor setup for electric all-wheel drive, developing around 615bhp and 650lb ft. Cadillac says, according to its own internal testing, the Lyriq-V is capable of a 0-60mph time of 3.3sec – quicker than cars like the riotously good fun or the utterly silly Escalade-V. Like any other GM electric car including the , the Lyriq-V uses the Ultium platform and battery technology. Here, a massive 102kWh battery pack is fitted, whereby Cadillac claims a zero to 80 per cent charge can be dealt with in 41 minutes. It’s not just about power, mind you. Cadillac has thrown a load of performance software and engineering at the Lyriq-V, including launch control and a ‘competitive mode’ for track driving. The brand’s Super Cruise technology is included as standard, as well as Brembo brakes and a bespoke EV sound. And, because it’s a V model, the hot Lyriq has a bespoke bodykit and 22-inch wheels, lowered multi-link suspension and a few V details peppered around the interior. Cadillac says that the Lyriq-V will go on sale in the United States for $79,990 (good luck selling any, in 2025…) and Canada, as well as Australia and New Zealand first. The brand also confirms it will launch in ‘other global markets to be announced at a later date,’ likely meaning a launch in European markets as the brand slowly expends across the Continent with models like the regular Lyriq and .

311,"New look and more tech for world’s most popular EV, the Tesla Model Y",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/tesla-model-y-uk-price-news-release-date-specs-range-and-interior/,Tim Pollard,2025-01-24,Car Magazine UK,"The – aka the world’s most popular EV – has had an update for 2025 (codenamed Juniper) and is now available to order from just under £61,000. The changes consist of tweaks to the styling, tech and aero efficiency, with Tesla hoping this will help build on what has been a hugely successful model for the American brand since the launch of the original in 2019. It seems that Tesla has gone for the less is more approach for its latest take on the Model Y. There’s less details and fussiness to the front end, with a flatter, smoother look complemented by narrow headlights and a light bar that goes across the width of the bonnet. The front end itself is lower (aiding aero efficiency) and eagle-eyed enthusiasts will no doubt spot the removal of the Tesla logo from the bonnet – just like on the . From launch, there’ll be two different wheel designs on offer – 20-inch Helix variant and 19-inch Aero style. Paintwork, meanwhile is a choice between Solid Black and Quicksilver paint. At the rear, there’s further changes to simplify the overall design. The reg plate sits much lower, while a reflective light bar gives the Tesla name badge a glowing red highlight. The latest Model Y’s cabin is based on the same design as the Model 3, but there’s a few small differences. Occupants are seated higher and will notice different materials lining the doors, while a wrapround ambient light stretches across the width of the cabin. Meanwhile, the latest Model Y also benefits from physical indicator stalks unlike the Model 3. Whether this is Tesla’s way of admitting the buttons on the wheel were a bad idea remains to be seen… Improved sound insulation also promises better refinement, while a wifi range extended by around 200% makes for greater flexibility with over-the-air updates. Climb into the back of the Model Y and there’s now an 8.0-inch rear touchscreen that rear occupants can use to watch videos on, adjust the climate (there’s heated and cooled seats in the front and rear) and play video games. Plus, it can be paired with Bluetooth headphones in order to keep the sound localised. As for bootspace, the Juniper takes a 20-litre reduction in space thanks to changes to the bodyshell, but now benefits from electric folding rear seats – useful for loading long or awkwardly shaped items. Initially, the Model Y Juniper will only be available in Launch Series all-wheel drive long range spec – a powertrain that Tesla has kept the same from the previous model. That means an unspecified battery size (Tesla never discloses the capacity of the batteries in its cars), up to 250kw charging speeds, 0-60mph in 4.3 seconds and a 125mph top speed. Tesla does however highlight that the WLTP range has improved from 331 miles to 353 miles owing to the aerodynamic and other hardware improvements.

336,This Valentino Rossi-spec BMW M4 is just what The Doctor ordered,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m4-vr46/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-02-24,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an all-new collaboration between nine-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi and Munich’s motorsport division. Although primarily known for his two-wheeled exploits, in recent years Rossi has had success driving for Audi and now BMW, as a works driver in its M4 GT3 racer. The M4 CS Edition VR46 you see here is the latest chapter in that partnership and was commissioned to mark his birthday. Of course, it’s not the only thing Valentino Rossi has been up to post-retirement: in addition to racing himself, he’s also set up his own MotoGP racing team, VR46. ‘There is no other brand that has motorsport so deeply rooted in its DNA as BMW M,’ said Rossi. ‘I am proud to be a BMW M works driver, and to share this passion. The fact that there is now a special VR46 edition, in which I was involved from the very beginning of the design process, makes me proud.’ The BMW’s performance stats are unchanged compared to the standard car, but this M4 does at least get some strong visual changes. Being a Rossi collaboration, it goes big on the #46 – the number the Italian used in his incredibly successful racing career. It also involves a large amount of dazzling yellow paint too – another hallmark of Rossi’s bikes, leathers and helmets. Rossi’s special edition, which is limited to just 46 cars will come in two variants: Sport and Style. Both feature the 46 prominently as well exposed carbonfibre, and vary mostly when it comes to the exterior colours; the Sport is finished in Marina Bay Blue metallic, with a darker 46 font, while the Style gets matt Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the lettering in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic. You’ll find Rossi’s customary day-glo yellow throughout; it’s around the kidney grille, on one of the spokes of the alloy wheels, and the brake callipers get the same treatment. There’s a huge yellow VR46 logo on the M4’s carbonfibre roof and the boot also gets VR46 branding. The yellow accents continue inside too. The M4 CS VR46 gets a mostly Night Blue interior in leather, but it benefits from more flashes of yellow and VR46 logos. There’s yellow contrast stitching on the wheel, along with a centre marker in Rossi’s customary colour. Each car gets a 1 of 46 plaque inside and also comes with a two day experience with The Doctor himself. Purchase one of these, and you’ll get a personal meeting with Rossi at his famous VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia, Italy – and you’ll get a BMW M driving day experience at Misano the following day.

337,"A110R 70 celebrates 70 years of Alpine, end of petrol production",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a110-r/,"Curtis Moldrich,",2025-02-26,Car Magazine UK,"The Alpine brand is 70 years old in 2025, and to celebrate it’s launching the A110R 70 – a limited edition of 770 cars that will also mark the end of production. In fact, it’s the end-of-the-line for the current A110 entirely this year, and there are changes to the regular range to reflect this as well. Chief among these is the addition of a model that appears to offer much of the A110R’s performance and appearance at a significantly lower cost. There is also much mucking about with paint colours. All planned fanfare ahead of the that’s coming to replace this outgoing petrol model in 2026. Alpine’s 70th birthday present to itself is mostly about carbonfibre. The wonder-weave is used for the front bonnet, the roof, the rear window – meaning it’s more of a slotted panel – and the rear wing. The 18-inch carbonfibre rear wheels probably have the most dramatic impact on the way the A110R drives, given the reduction in unsprung weight. There are no chassis changes or power upgrades over the regular A110R (which is detailed further down this page), which was already the most focused variant in the range. This means 296bhp and 250lb ft, greeting the surrounding hordes via an Akrapovic exhaust. Michelin PS Cup 2 tyres are fitted as standard, and you can choose from seven different colours for the Brembo brake calipers. Speaking of colours, there are 10 body colours for the A110R, plus 70th anniversary logos on the wheelarches, door sills and headrests, as well as a few strategically positioned French flags. Four different interior design schemes are available, too. Then there’s the special Tricolour edition of this special edition… Nested within the 770 examples of the A110R 70 available are three further limited allocations that make up an even more exclusive Tricolour edition – 70 of each finished in Blue Caddy, Glacier Blanc and Rouge Sismique. These cars not only echo the colours of the French flag, they also pay tribute to the three Alpine A106s that officially marked the creation of the Alpine brand in 1955. The A110R 70s have the 70th anniversary logo marked out in visible carbonfibre on the roof. But they’re also fully colour-coordinated – meaning the stripe on the 18-inch carbonfibre wheels and the new Sabelt upholstery in the cabin match the chosen paint. The new Alpine A110R 70 is priced from £103,345, and should be available to order from March 2025. The Alpine A110R might be the ultimate expression of the Dieppe-built sports car, or the one that strays furthest from the brilliant original A110’s DNA, it depends on your view. Lighter, firmer and faster than the A110S, the track-focussed if still road-legal R mirrors the positioning of the Porsche Cayman GT4, making it an entirely logical piece of the product-planning jigsaw. It also inevitably moves the R even further away from the supple-limbed agility of the original A110 than the imperfect S. Weight falls just 34kg, there are modest aerodynamic gains and performance from the 1.8-litre turbo four is unchanged from the S’s 296bhp, yet the many detail changes together with bigger steps in several areas do suggest a quite different and potentially highly enticing driving experience. CAR spent a day at Alpine HQ with several engineers and senior personnel to learn more… While a 34kg weight saving does sound underwhelming, it’s important to remember that the A110 starts from a baseline some 300kg or so lighter than any competitor, so the R’s engineers are chasing diminishing returns. And the weight-saving measures are quite comprehensive. Full carbonfibre wheels produced by Duqueine account for most of the reduction at 12.5kg – the front wheels feature a more open face to promote better brake cooling, while the rears are more closed to reduce drag. There’s carbonfibre for the bonnet, roof and rear window/engine lid, the latter necessitating a digital rear-view mirror because there’s no view over your shoulder, just like a . Inside, there’s racey microfibre trim, straps for door handles, six-point harnesses and full carbonfibre Sabelt seats that save 5kg. One kilo was saved removing the active exhaust flap. Overall weight drops to 1082kg. A modest power increase is certainly the norm in this niche, but when CAR raised the issue, Alpine programme director Xavier Sommer replied : ‘We are not in an arms race, and power has a bad impact on weight, cost, cooling, brakes… In a world of CO2, even with this kind of car it’s more and more important, people are more aware to have a good power-to-weight ratio and I think our message will be increasingly successful.’ Hence the powertrain is lifted straight from the S – a 1.8-litre turbo four with 296bhp and 251lb ft that’s mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox, though there is a new 3D-printed double-wall exhaust outlet. Acceleration figures change too, with 0-62mph falling to 3.9sec (a 0.3sec improvement over the S), and top speed climbs to 177mph thanks to aerodynamic upgrades (up 7mph over the optional aero-kitted S). Alpine says aerodynamics have been improved with help from its Alpine F1 team in the wind tunnel, with key features including a ‘swan-neck’ rear spoiler, additional intakes in the front apron and a new, wider rear diffuser. Downforce increases 27kg at the rear, and while we were initially told downforce decreases by 30kg at the front, revised figures state a 14kg increase for the front compared with an A110S equipped with the optional aero kit. There’s also a flat underbody combined with new sideskirts to promote smooth airflow under the car, contributing towards a 5 per cent reduction in drag (with the rear spoiler in its ‘track attitude’ setting). This should be the most palpable difference between the A110R and other Alpines, especially at the typical road speeds where the full aerodynamic improvements won’t be felt. Compared with the A110S, spring stiffness increases 10 per cent all-round, anti-roll bar stiffness is up 10 per cent front, 25 per cent rear, and new ZF dampers are adjustable for compression and rebound via 20 clicks. The R is 10mm lower than an S as standard, but the suspension can be lowered a further 10mm – though Alpine stresses this setting is only suitable for track work, where it will no doubt prove particularly transformative, especially in terms of managing weight transfer at higher speeds. Crucially, the entire set-up has been tuned on a bespoke compound of semi-slick Michelin Cup 2 R tyre. Sizes of 215/40 R18 front and 245/40 R18 at the rear are unchanged from the A110S, which also offers the Cup 2 as an option. Brembo brakes with 320mm discs front and rear are standard – another option for the S – but the R has improved cooling thanks to new ducting on the upper front suspension arms and undertray. ‘We tested at Circuit de Charade, Magny Cours and Nardo,’ test driver David Praschl told CAR. ‘We want to keep the A110 feeling and balance, but with better body control. You can still play with the R – there’s some understeer in faster corners, but it’s still reactive in slower corners and the handling now responds faster as you lift the throttle. The steering feels noticeably heavier [thanks to the uprated chassis] – not a lot, but you notice.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

338,New Alpine A110 GTS could be pick of revamped range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a110/,CJ Hubbard,2025-02-26,Car Magazine UK,"Alpine is giving the current A110 range a shake in its final 12 months of production. Not only is there a new top-end , celebrating 70 years since the launch of the brand, there’s also a new A110 GTS model targeting a peachy middle ground. Alpine says the new GTS combines the sporty edge of the previous A110S with the ‘everyday comfort’ of the A110 GT. Available with an optional bodykit influenced by the A110R and the exact same power output, yet costing some £36k less than the range-topper, this could be a more reasonably priced apex for many A110 customers. According to Alpine: ‘Its vocation is to provide thrills while ensuring a serene daily drive.’ The thrills are obvious in origin. The GTS includes the 296bhp / 250lb ft engine variant and the S chassis tuning that goes with this. That means plenty of power and plenty of grip, but not quite the sweet suppleness of the standard suspension fitted to 249bhp versions, including the car we’ve recently been driving. Add the optional GTS aero kit, which includes a front splitter, side skirts, rear spoiler and rear wing with carbonfibre gooseneck mounts, and promises ‘better downforce for even greater agility’, and that A110R-lite thing is in full effect. An equally optional ‘GT Race’ 18-inch wheel package comes with the same Michelin PS Cup 2 tyres as the A110R as well. The ‘serene’ daily driving aspect is perhaps less obvious, given the firmer underpinnings. But you do get a new GTS Grey leather interior finish, the option of black leather seats or ‘colourful’ Alcantara racing seats, and a standard Focal Premium audio system. There are a number of new paint options, too, including a trio of matte finishes. Pricing for the A110 GTS starts at £67,311 – a chunky upgrade over the entry-level A110, which is now priced from £55,160. But you do get that boost from 249bhp to 295bhp, as well as the more focused chassis. Certainly it’s a bargain compared with the A110R 70, which is £103,345 – an increase that accounts for a lot of carbonfibre and an even sharper, less forgiving suspension setup. The revised range marks the start of the final 12 months of production for the current A110 – which means you’re now on notice if you want to buy a petrol-powered Alpine. The next A110 is set to be an all-electric model only. Alpine CEO Philippe Krief says the last of the present generation will be ‘passing the baton to the ’, which suggests we should be seeing the production version of the A110 EV in the early part of 2026 at the latest. The standard A110 has 249bhp at its disposal, sprinting to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. The GT, S and GTS versions get a power boost to 296bhp with 0-62mph acceleration times dropping to 4.2 seconds. Top speed has previously been limited to 155mph, but with this removed flat out the A110 will go 170-177mph, The more powerful engine has been tweaked to give maximum torque at a lower end of the rev range, and maximum power closer to the redline. A launch control function interestingly shuts off a cylinder when powering up for a ‘more engaging engine note.’ CJ is a former Associate Editor of CAR, and now runs parent company Bauer Media’s Digital Automotive Hub – the in-house team that provides much of the online content for CAR and sister site Parkers.co.uk as well as helping out with CAR magazine.

339,Kia EV2 showcases concept version of brand’s smallest EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/ev2/,James Dennison,2025-02-27,Car Magazine UK,"► Kia has debuted a concept version of a new bookend to its growing range of EVs. Called the EV2, it previews what will eventually be the smallest electric vehicle from the South Korean manufacturer. Styled like a shrunken EV3, it still has a whiff of the SUV about it thanks to the upright proportions yet its dimensions are deceptively dinky. Expected rivals for the EV2 – when it arrives in 2026 – will include the Skoda Epiq, Renault 4 and Volkswagen ID.2, with more likely to follow in the competitive small EV market. The EV2 is according to the name, all-electric, yet despite the recent model offensive of EVs, Kia has confirmed it has no plans to stop producing ICE vehicles. The EV2 Concept’s interior has been designed around the idea of a picnic in the city. For example, the rear bench folds upwards allowing the front seats to slide back and create more room. Also, an extendable bench (with additional cushion) can be brought out from the side of the front bench to create an additional seating area, while the backrest can also be removed and taken away as a portable cushion for al fresco dining experience. We were also told that the same thing can be done with the door speakers, although this wasn’t functioning on the concept car we saw. The concept features some predictably eye-catching styling touches, yet while many of these won’t make it into production we’re confident that the basic shape will be maintained. That means four doors with short overhangs, clean surfaces and contrasting body panels. This tallies with spy shots we’ve seen of the EV2 in developing testing wearing heavy camouflage. We’re yet to see any official figures on the EV2’s range and performance, yet we strongly expect a single-motor car built on the E-GMP platform that underpins its bigger brother, the EV3. Prices will likely start around £25,000 when the EV2 launches in 2026. James heads up our automotive video activities in the UK and is responsible for video on CAR magazine.

312,Audi’s Q6 e-tron concept transforms sedate SUV into wild off-roader,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q6-e-tron-concept/,Ted Welford,2025-01-27,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has unveiled a wild off-road concept based on its Q6 e-tron to show the potential of its PPE electric car platform. Using a as its base, Audi has raised the suspension by 160mm and widened the track by 225mm courtesy of huge wheelarch extensions to accommodate the big knobbly tyres. The firm says it is ‘redefining quattro’ with this concept. New front and rear bumpers help to enable various modifications, with the front being distinguished by an imposing five-LED lighting signature. A roof rack is also fitted, naturally. But of greater note is what’s under the surface, with four portal axles used – as seen on cars such as the – that feature a gearbox within the wheel hub, allowing the axle to be positioned higher than the wheel. It enables far greater ground clearance as a result and means huge tyres can be fitted – as evidenced on this Q6. While the Q6 e-tron’s power remains the same as the SQ6 at 510bhp, the portal axles allow for a monstrous increase to torque to a staggering 9883lb ft. Audi says its new design of axles enables around 30 percentage points more torque than typical portal axles and that this concept can climb gradients up to 45 degrees. Though it might seem quite a far-fetched concept car, Audi has history with off-road concept cars after putting its into production in 2024, with 1,000 units being produced, albeit not for the UK. That means there is the potential for a toned-down version of the Q6 to make production. Speaking about the concept, Audi CEO Gernot Dollner, said: “The Q6 e-tron offroad concept is a reinterpretation of quattro. The model shows the potential that our platform for all electric vehicles already has today. This vehicle can claim new ground. We look forward to seeing our customers’ reactions to this highly emotive car.” The Audi Q6 e-tron off-road concept will be seen in action at the FAT International ice race held in Zell am See, Austria, on February 1.

The new Grande Panda will come with a full electric drivetrain or as hybrid. The hybrid – which is the clever (ish) MHEV jobbie that incorporates an electric motor into a six-speed dual-clutch transmission, giving it some modest electric-only drive capability – starts at £18,975 for the Icon variant. Not bad. But even more intriguingly, the Granda Panda Electric is priced from just £20,975. This, says Fiat, makes it the cheapest proper B-segment you can buy right now. We say, it’s also one of the most adorable. Just look at that boxy, pixel-tastic design. No longer a tiny city car with limited appeal outside of Italy but also not as big as that Grande prefix might suggest. The new Panda is described as a ‘global’ model (it will be sold in more than 60 countries) and uses the same cost-optimised platform as the in an effort to bring affordable electric motoring to more people and compete with the challenge from low-cost Chinese EVs. Revealed in July 2024 to coincide with Fiat’s 125th anniversary, the Grande Panda is also the first in a new line-up of ‘Panda’ models as Fiat aims to create a new sub-brand, similar to the approach it’s previously taken with the extended family. The production-spec Fiat Grande Panda uses many design cues first previewed by , with an appealing boxy and chunky look. The proportions clearly link it to the new Citroen C3, with which it shares the low-cost Stellantis ‘Smart Car platform’. The Fiat’s chunky wheelarches and pixelated headlights give it a little more snap. Roof rails add to its rugged look, while a new black panel at the front incorporates the new Fiat logo. Like the , Fiat has aimed to create the most space from a fairly small footprint. At just shy of four metres long, it’s 20cm longer than the , but no bigger than plenty of superminis. Fiat says there is over 14 litres of storage in the dashboard alone, including a similar ‘pocket’ shelf to the original Panda. The cabin is said to be able to ‘comfortably transport five people’ while the electric version’s 361-litre boot is also noticeably bigger than that of a C3; the hybrid model has 412 litres of load space. Sick of that charging cable sliding about, clogging up the boot? The Grande Panda is the first electric car to incorporate a tethered cable, a curly connection that stashes away in the front. Sadly, this is only useful for connecting to 7kW charging units,  such as your basic home Wallbox. A separate rapid charging port for DC connections is standard at the rear – though this is limited to 100kW, so not exactly scorching fast – and you can add an 11kW AC connection back there if you need it. The Grande Panda will be available as both a hybrid and as an electric version. There’s is no mention yet of the cheaper petrol engine available on the Citroen C3. The electric model uses a 111bhp motor paired to a 44kWh battery, with Fiat promising a 199-mile WLTP range. The hybrid model features the 1.2-litre mild-hybrid system familiar from other recent Stellantis products, including the . Here it produces 99bhp, with an electric motor integrated into the six-speed automatic transmission.

314,How China killed the Model 2,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/tesla/how-china-killed-the-model-2/,Nick Gibbs,2025-01-28,Car Magazine UK,"If you’ve never heard of , that won’t be the case for long. Omoda is owned by Chery, the car company that runs a joint venture with JLR in China and is also the country’s largest exporter of vehicles. The launch cars are compact SUVs – , one electric – priced from just over £25,000. Any qualms that Omoda’s quality might be lagging the competition will be eased for many by a £5000 saving over the equivalent More models are planned, and in five years Omoda will be challenging Kia in terms of sales, says UK head Victor Zhang. Such is the competitive zeal of the ; you wouldn’t take the bet. Already this year MG – owned by China’s SAIC – outsold Skoda, Renault and Seat. The competitive advantage held by the Chinese is largely within EVs. The drivetrain that delivers the cut in emissions demanded by legislators in the battle to halt global warming is also the one that the Chinese have bet on so successfully, scaring the hell out of established car makers. ‘We’ve never seen a competitor like this before,’ Ford CEO Jim Farley said of China earlier this year. Even Tesla has changed strategy, abandoning its plan for the entry Model 2 for what analysts are now dubbing Model 2.5: cheaper than current cars but adapting their platform to avoid the need for a wholesale, ground-up redesign. The car will launch ‘in the first half of next year’ Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in July 2024. Did the threat of Chinese competition kill Model 2? Almost certainly. Never the speediest, Tesla knows it can’t move fast enough to develop a new and affordable mainstream model and be sure it won’t be eclipsed at launch. China is a unique competitor because companies there aren’t playing by the same financial rulebook. State support is rife. Just how much was revealed by the European Commission in published evidence for its decision to impose higher tariffs on Chinese EVs imported into the European Union. Among the state-directed financial benefits enjoyed by BYD, SAIC and Geely were gold-plated AAA credit ratings, giving them access to cheap loans. The Commission, however, found they didn’t have assets to cover their short-term debt obligations, making them much higher risk than the rating suggests. Perhaps the greatest gift from the Chinese government was early and decisive orchestration of the battery market, right down to the raw materials. The European Commission noted that ‘input suppliers are not free-market opera- tors but entities which performed the assigned governmental functions. The system guarantees that favoured battery companies including BYD secure the cheapest supply of materials. On the evidence, the EU has proposed tariffs depending on the level of state support, a more nuanced approach than the US and Canada’s flat 100 per cent tariff. The UK has yet to show its hand. And there’s more. Cut-throat competition within China’s own market ensures home-grown car firms are fighting tooth and nail for competitive advantages in manufacturing, technology and quality. Any flabbiness in the fitness levels of European competitors needs to be pumped out pronto or a slow death awaits. Nick Gibbs is CAR magazine's go-to newshound.

315,The BMW iX gets a 'Neue' look - plus more power and a longer range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/ix/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-28,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has given the iX a refresh, with the now benefitting from a more aggressive design, more power and more range. It comes four years after the electric SUV was first revealed, and the facelift moves the iX closer to the forthcoming design language. The nip and tuck comes with three new models; the xDrive45 (beige in these pictures), xDrive60 (light blue) M Sport and M70 xDrive (black) – as well as new trims. The most obvious changes come right at the front of the new iX, as Munich’s design department has moved the iX towards the Neue Klasse concepts we’ve already seen. The kidney grille is still present – and huge – but the headlights are now narrow and more like BMW’s forthcoming design language. And yes, BMW has given the iX an optional light-up grille – though it’s standard on the range-topping M70 xDrive. Underneath, new battery technology and a new inverter push the range up throughout the line up. There are bigger batteries all round: the xDrive 45 battery capacity grows 30% to 94.8kWh, while the xDrive60 moves to 109kWh and the M70 xDrive moves to 109kWh too. The changes mean WLTP range has crept up on all models: the xDrive45 has a range of 374 miles, while the M70 will now reach 366 miles before needing a charge. Meanwhile, the xDrive60 (which replaces the xDrive50) will make it to 426 miles before needing a charge – 34 miles more than its predecessor. Power is up too: the xDrive45 delivers 414bhp and it’ll hit 0-62mph in 5.1 seconds. That’s one whole second faster than before. The xDrive 60 gets 21bhp extra (over the xDrive 50) and makes 552bhp, with a 0-62mph sprint time of 4.6 seconds. Top speed for both is 124mph. Finally, the top of the range M70 now makes 668bhp compared to 628bhp, for a 0-62mph time of just 3.8 seconds. Top speed is 155mph. Munich’s engineers have also worked on the chassis to cope with the extra power and a new weight balance; there’s a double-wishbone at the front, and a five-link at the rear. The range-topping M70 gets a range of extra toys, including M-specific tuning, anti-roll bars and rear-wheel steering. And the brake callipers are painted red too, obviously. All models also get Hill Descent Control and Dynamic Stability Control. Seven new colours are available, and the iX can be had with 21-, 22- or even 23-inch rims. They come as standard depending on the trim you go for. We’ll update this article when we know more.

316,BMW design is bored of being provocative,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bmw/bmw-design-is-bored-of-being-provocative/,Ben Miller,2025-01-29,Car Magazine UK,"In a significant re-organisation of its design department, BMW has brought in ex-Polestar and Volvo hotshot Max Missoni and moved former BMW studio head Domagoj Dukec to Rolls-Royce. There’s a lot going on here, with BMW’s restructuring in part reflecting the trend shifts in design more generally (increased emphasis on digital and sound design, together with sustainability). But the Missoni/Dukec moves are particularly significant. Cerebral and original, with a deep understanding of high-net-worth individuals and their shifting tastes, Dukec should be a good fit for Rolls-Royce, though he’ll have to adapt to a tighter creative leash at Goodwood. And with Missoni in charge of BMW’s upper mid-size and luxury-class cars, a return to elegance looks assured. Dukec’s BMW design era has, since the , been equal parts class and chaos. It’d be wrong to paint Dukec as its sole architect; Adrian van Hooydonk was in overall command and remains so. In its push to create more distinctive cars for its more extrovert clients, BMW design launched a thousand memes and, at times, threatened to break the internet with the ire it generated. The old adage that there’s no such thing as bad publicity surely doesn’t extend to car design. There was at least method in BMW’s apparent madness, as explained by its top men a couple of years ago. The ‘classic’ model lines, notably the 3-series and 5-series, would, in the words of Ron Burgundy, stay classy. Indeed the current 5, in gestation then, is probably the pick of the current range for design. At the same time Dukec and his team would cut loose on BMW’s more dynamic, less conservative cars, as von Hooydonk explained: ‘If one kind of customer is looking for a beautiful and timeless car, then of course we will design it. But there are also customers looking for something like an X6, which is certainly polarising – you either hate it or you love it. That approach wouldn’t work for a 3-series or a 5-series because they sell in bigger volumes, so it’s clear you can’t come with just one solution.’ But too many cars – notably the , the i7 and the Frankfurt Concept 4 and the M3/M4 that followed, with their wildly enlarged kidney grilles – lacked the elegant dynamism that has been a Munich hallmark for half a century. (Paul Bracq’s E21 3-series was surely pivotal, but so too were the earlier E9 and 02 cars.) To their credit, Dukec and his boss weren’t fazed. ‘Actually, all the negative comments prove that we achieved what we wanted to achieve,’ Dukec told in 2022. ‘Obviously it would be nice to always be getting compliments. But whether the comments bother me or not depends on the car. In this case [the XM] they don’t. But if people were calling a 5-series ugly that would be bad, because a 5-series should never be ugly. With the kidney grilles it bothers me only if they are an M customer. We know the customers for this car want to stand out. We are not doing this just for our own sake. We didn’t sit here and think, “Yeah, let’s do something provocative.” It’s because we listen. And of course our sales figures are improving. So, you can read many bad articles or comments on social media, “Oh, you’re going to ruin this!” But from the sales figures you can see we’re not ruining anything.’ Max Missoni’s hands are as safe as they come. A VW designer for 10 years after graduating from the Royal College of Art, he joined Volvo in 2012. The Swedish marque’s renaissance under Geely is a textbook example of how to breathe new life into a faltering brand, and Missoni’s work with long-time collaborator and supporter Thomas Ingenlath (who championed Missoni when they both worked at VW) was fundamental to its success. From the sophisticated, monolithic XC90 to the handsome V90 estate and smash-hit XC40, Missoni and Ingenlath made Scandi chic again. His more recent role as head of design at Polestar, which has operated with a start-up mentality, has fast-tracked his experience, honing skills it might have taken decades to develop in a more traditional OEM. Totally immersed in the brand, his keen eye and sharp intellect informed everything from infotainment typefaces and theme colours to the engineering of the , in which the deletion of a normal rear screen came from a willingness to look at old compromises anew and make brave decisions. And it’s testament to its design leadership that Polestar has made it this far. The , until recently the only model it had and a fairly average family car and EV by most metrics, sold pretty much on style alone. Make no mistake, Missoni is no nostalgia-driven conservative. His BMWs won’t be safe to the point of anonymity. But given the man’s track record they’ll likely be beautiful first, bold second. As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy.

317,Polestar 6 electric roadster delayed as new boss prioritises SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/polestar/6/,Tim Pollard,2025-01-29,Car Magazine UK,"The new Polestar 6 electric roadster has been delayed, as the new CEO has chosen to prioritise the new compact crossover. It’s a blow for fans of convertible EVs, a niche breed who were looking forward to the 6’s arrival in 2026. ‘The Polestar 6 is moving back because it’s really small volume,’ said new Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. ‘While everybody loves it, I need to make money and therefore we decided to bring the Polestar 7 compact SUV forward as much as possible.’ Lohscheller has not yet committed to a date for either the 6 or 7, but CAR understands the Polestar 7 will come first, most likely in 2027 for a 2028 launch. This suggests the open-topped and British-developed Polestar 6 won’t arrive until right towards the end of the decade. The rapidly expanding Swedish EV specialist is among the first to launch a convertible , although this will be a much more costly EV than the . To date, car makers have focused on sensible and higher-volume hatchback and SUV EVs, but here’s proof that fun cars can survive the transition to electric, too. Polestar announced at 2022 Monterey Car Week that it would turn the into the Polestar 6 – an electric car with a folding hard top. Its silent propulsion system should be well matched to the alfresco thrills of fresh-air motoring. The revised launch order will wreak havoc with Polestar’s naming strategy, which has historically followed the order in which they launch. A quick cheat’s guide is as follows: Production confirmation came in late August 2022, but it now seems almost certain that sun-seekers will have to wait for at least half a decade from that date for the 6 to be commercially available in showrooms. That’s because the Gothenburg scale-up has its hands full launching one new electric car every year, as it seeks to hit breakeven this year. The Polestar 6 won’t be cheap: when it was first shown, a spokeswoman suggested a price tag around the $200,000 mark, pointing to an RRP of £170k in the UK. Lohscheller refused to discuss even estimated prices when CAR asked him for an update in January 2025. Polestar has already announced that 500 launch-special LA Concept Editions will arrive first and customers could put down a $25k (£20k) deposit to secure one. This initial batch has already sold out. However, unlike the 1, the Polestar 6 be a full production car – enabled by the clever-clogs aluminium architecture developed by Polestar’s UK engineering facility near Coventry. This team taps into the low-volume production knowledge base among local Aston Martin and Lotus R&D specialists. The Polestar 6’s new aluminium-intensive platform has a powerful technical heart. The O2 concept had twin electric motors with a combined 650kW output (equivlent to 872bhp and 664lb ft) powered by an 800-volt electrical architecture. Acceleration is promised to be blistering, with Polestar claiming 0-62mph in 3.2sec and a top speed capped at 155mph. We don’t expect the production car to be much slower. ‘With the overwhelming consumer and press response, we took the decision to put this stunning roadster into production and I am so excited to make it a reality,’ said Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar’s founding, and former, CEO when he confirmed the production green light three years ago. ‘Polestar 6 is a perfect combination of powerful electric performance and the thrill of fresh air with the top down.’ Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

318,BMW M3 CS Touring: Munich’s wicked wagon just got wickeder,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m3-touring/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-01-29,Car Magazine UK,"It’s here! BMW has fully revealed the M3 CS Touring after teasing it during the Daytona 24h weekend. As you’d expect it follows the CS formula, so it’s both lighter, more powerful and has an even more precise chassis than before. The M3 CS Touring benefits from upgrades in three key areas: first, the power. There’s a 3.0-litre in-line six under the bonnet, but the CS gets a more rigid crank case, forged lightweight crankshaft and cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The cylinder bores have been reworked for less frictional losses, and the cooling system has been upgraded to account for the increased output. Engine mounts have also been stiffened. The Turbo now goes up to 2.1 bar and there’s also an ECU flash for even more power. Put it all together and the CS Touring makes 558bhp, 20bhp more than the current M2 Competition Touring. Peak torque comes in at 479ft lb from 2750 to 5950rpm, so it should be more usable too. 0-62mph takes 3.5 seconds, while 0-124mph takes just 11.7. It’s all mated to an eight-speed M xDrive four-wheel drive system. It can prioritise grip or fun, with an entirely two-wheel drive mode that diverts all power to the rear wheels. First the software: the DSC and M Dynamics modes have been tweaked for track driving, as has the electronically controlled M suspension dampers and the M Servotronic power steering. Other toys include an M Drive Analyser and M Laptimer which come as standard in the CS, as well as 10-stage traction control system for track use. Munich’s engineers did put their laptops away for a bit, though; new M front-end strut braces and spring strut towers further improve rigidity. Lightness is also a key factor for the CS, so the car is now packed with carbonfibre reinforced plastic parts. There’s a carbonfibre (CFRP) bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffusers – all of which look even more aggressive this time around, as well as being lighter. The interior also gets its fair share of CFRP too; BMW has packed in Carbon bucket seat and carbonfibre paddles, but you’ll also finds strips of the stuff in the interior trim and the centre console. Overall, the CS is 15kg lither than the competition, and that’s despite the extra CS trinkets you get in the interior. The M3 CS Touring will be available in four colours and will cost £120,600. Deliveries should hit the UK in March 2025. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

319,Renault Filante Record is here to push boundaries and break records,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/filante-record/,Graham King,2025-01-30,Car Magazine UK,"No, this isn’t Captain America’s new ride, it’s the Renault Filante Record, a “laboratory on wheels” filled with innovative tech that the French brand hopes will break records. Efficiency rather than speed is the focus, and some of the tech will eventually trickle down to Renault’s production cars. It’s set to get rolling later in 2025 but you can see it at the RetroMobile show in Paris from 3-9 February. You’re not wrong. According to Renault, “the designers set out to create a monolithic sculpture of clean, flowing lines that could almost be described as organic.” Fighter jets and 19 Century speed records are cited as influences, there’s also a heavy dose of a particular Renault record-breaker of the past, on which more later. All those influences add up to a wild-looking spear of a car. But every aspect of the Filante Record’s styling serves an aerodynamic purpose. Pick out any element of its bodywork and it’s drawn as tightly and smoothly as possible, to control the airflow around, over and away from the car as precisely as possible. Even the suspension components help. The proportions are slightly odd, the car measuring 5.12 metres long and just 1.71 metres wide, the single-seater cockpit set a long way back. But, again, it’s a highly efficient shape that pierces the air. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) testing has shown it works, wind tunnel validation begins in Spring 2025. The colour is called Ultraviolet Blue, by the way. It’s a new shade that appears blue in some lights, violet in others. The Renault Filante Record has a hefty 87kWh battery pack – the same capacity offered in the – but it weighs a comparatively skimpy 600kg. That’s because it employs cell-to-pack construction which does away with modules that usually sit between cell and pack. The technique also reduces the pack’s size and allows more flexibility in its shape. The carbon battery casing cuts weight even further. Renault hasn’t revealed any details on the Filante Record’s motor, power output or performance figures. But the emphasis is on efficiency, not speed, so those stats aren’t especially relevant at this point. Renault worked with race car builder Ligier to design the Filante Record’s chassis. Aside from aerodynamics, weight was the key consideration. The target was 1000kg; with a battery pack weighing 600kg, that left just 400kg for the rest of the car. As such, the car’s structure combines aluminium, carbon and steel alloys to maximise strength and minimise weight. A technique called topology optimisation was used to make sure each material is only used where it’s needed, in the minimum quantity required for the job it has to do. The aluminium elements are made from a new form of the material – Scalmalloy – designed specifically for 3D printing. Renault notes 3D printing allows parts to be made with extreme precision and minimum waste. Yet more weight is saved in the Filante Record by using steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire. The position of the all the controls has been ergonomically optimised, the steering yoke is built around a cylindrical digital screen that shows all the car’s vital data. The yoke is attached to the canopy; when it’s opened, the yoke moves clear of the seat. That seat is upholstered in canvas stretched over a carbon ‘blade’ frame. Even the ventilation system uses a reduced number of components to keep weight down. Back outside, the Michelin tyres are designed to provide high levels of performance and grip while having as little impact on range as possible. Renault’s motorsport history is long, storied and needs little explanation here. Less well known are its achievements in breaking speed and endurance records. Perhaps the best-known of Renault’s record-breaking cars is the fearsome 40CV des Records (pictured below), whose 100 anniversary the Filante Record marks. That car set a raft of speed and distance benchmarks over 3 hours, 500km, 500 miles and 24 hours. Tribute is paid in the Filante Record’s styling to the 1926 coupe iteration of the 40CV, aping it’s long, tapering shape, sloping nose and wide-set headlights. Renault also name checks the Etoile Filante, a 1950s turbine-powered machine whose name is dropped for the Filante Record. The word ‘filante’ comes from the French ‘filer’, which means to spin, stretch or lengthen. Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"

Following on from the 2022 Ice Race special edition, the Swedish firm has now designed a ‘collection’ of one-offs, based on its new and . The rally-inspired models have been developed with Polestar’s head of driving dynamics Joakim Rydholm, who has multiple podiums to his name in Swedish rallying. Key differences on the trio of cars include raising the ride height with three-way adjustable Ohlins dampers and new white ‘Rally Legend’ OZ Racing wheels shod in Pirelli studded tyres. Other changes include spotlights (naturally) and Recaro bucket seats. A front strut brace is added, and a new bright yellow and white livery also makes them stand out in the snow. Modifications vary between the Polestar 3 and 4, with the suspension raised by 40mm on the latter and 20mm on the former.  The larger Polestar 3 arguably looks more dakar-ready with its big roof rack housing a spare wheel and ultra-bright light bar, as well as snow ladders. The Polestar 4 meanwhile looks the business with all-terrain skis and even gets a drift-inspired hand brake. Joakim Rydholm says: “We created something truly special when we worked on the Polestar 2 Arctic Circle, and to now apply that formula to our two new SUVs has been a fun and challenging task. “We have worked closely with our leading technology partners to bring bespoke engineering solutions to these cars that emphasise our performance DNA – and make them incredibly fun to drive.” Polestar will show off its trio of Arctic Specials at the FAT International ice race on February 1 – a motorsport event like no other held on the ice at Zell am See, Austria. will also be at the event. Michael Lohscheller, , said: “We develop our cars under challenging conditions within the Arctic Circle in Sweden, and at the FAT Ice Race we will showcase that on ice there is nothing better than a Polestar. We are really excited to be part of this special event with our full model line-up, where it’s all about car culture and the performance experience.” Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
321,Ford Le Mans Hypercar program announced: it’s a new sport car racing golden age,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ford/hypercar-entry/,Graham King,2025-01-31,Car Magazine UK,"FIA WEC program planned, as well The Le Mans 24 Hours has been getting ever more interesting over the last few years as a plethora of manufacturers throw their hat into the top class. The 2027 edition could be the most interesting yet, as Ford has announced its intention to join the Hypercar ranks. A full FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) is on the cards, as well. Ford, of course, has a long and storied history at Le Mans. It famously broke Ferrari’s dominance with the GT40, taking four back-to-back wins from 1966 to 1969. More recently, the won the LMGTE class at Le Mans on the 50 anniversary of that first GT40 victory, while the took a debut podium in 2024. There have been successes in WEC and the American-based IMSA SportsCar Championship, as well. Curiously, Ford says its Hypercar will be built to IMSA’s LMDh specifications, yet intends to race in the WEC, where the FIA LMH ruleset prevails – though it can still run in the top Hypercar class. LMDh is a lower-cost formula with a spec chassis based on second-tier LMP2 hardware, standardised aerodynamics and a shared hybrid system. Other brands contesting LMDh include Porsche, BMW and Cadillac. There are no actual details on what Ford’s Hypercar will look like, who it’ll be built by, or what will power it. However, we can infer a couple of things. One of the approved chassis suppliers for LMDh is Canadian outfit Multimatic, which has designed and built all of Ford’s factory-built sports car racers for the last 20 years or so. And it may well be powered by the 5.0-litre Coyote V8 engine that’s found in the Mustang GT3 and tied with the Cadillac Hypercar’s for best-sounding engine at Le Mans in 2024. Ford Motor Company boss Bill Ford said: “We are entering a new era for performance and racing at Ford. You can see it from what we’re doing on-road and off-road. When we race, we race to win. And there is no track or race that means more to our history than Le Mans. It is where we took on Ferrari and won in the 1960s. It is where we returned 50 years later and shocked the world and beat Ferrari again. “I am thrilled that we’re going back to Le Mans and competing at the highest level of endurance racing. We are ready to once again challenge the world, and ‘go like hell!’” It looks like the 2027 Le Mans Hypercar grid will feature Porsche, BMW, Cadillac, , Toyota, Alpine, Ferrari and , plus Lamborghini and Peugeot if they stick around.

322,Rare Mercedes streamliner grand prix car driven by Stirling Moss sells for £43 million to become second most expensive car ever sold,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/most-expensive-cars/,Tim Pollard,2025-02-02,Car Magazine UK,"A rare 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 R Stromlinienwagen has sold at auction for €51 million (£42.5m) to become the second most expensive car ever sold. It’s the first Streamliner-bodied W196 R ever offered for private ownership, after Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum put it up for sale after 59 years in its collection. It was auctioned by RM Sotheby’s at a private sale in Stuttgart, where it sold for €51,155,000. That makes it comfortably the most expensive Grand Prix ever sold – and no wonder, when you consider its provenance. It was driven by Juan Manuel Fangio to victory at the 1955 Buenos Aires Grand Prix and also by Sir Stirling Moss at the 1955 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, where he recorded the fastest lap. That’ll be the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe (below), which leapfrogged a string of Ferraris at the top of the world’s most valuable cars when it sold in 2022. The 1955 gullwing was sold by Mercedes at an RM Sotheby’s auction for €135 million (£115m at the time) to a private collector. Monies raised were used to establish a Mercedes-Benz fund to provide education and research into environmental science and decarbonisation projects for young people, Stuttgart said at the time. The sky-high price can be accounted for by the 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe’s rarity: it is one of just two prototypes made and was named after its chief engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut. It was released from the Mercedes-Benz Classic Collection. The 300 SLR was based around the W196 R Grand Prix car which won two world championships in the hands of Juan Manuel Fangio. It was capable of 180mph, making it one of the fastest cars available in period. The delectable 300 SLR overtook the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, which sold in 2018 for a record $48m at the prestigious RM Sotheby’s sale at Monterey Car Week. That record stood for four years until the May 2022 Uhlenhaut sale. Tellingly, 16 of the top 27 most expensive cars ever sold at auction were Ferraris (see our list below). Rare Aston Martins, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos, a McLaren and even a Ford GT40 are peppered throughout the most valuable cars. We’ve worked with our classic car sister titles and auctions experts to compile this list of the most expensive cars: Values of significant cars continue to rise and signs are that speculators are viewing rare and exalted cars as an investment vehicle.

323,The Citroen C3 Aircross is now the cheapest new electric SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/c3-aircross/,Ted Welford,2025-02-03,Car Magazine UK,"Citroen has confirmed pricing and specs for its new C3 Aircross, which brings the option of seven seats and very keen pricing to the . Arriving for a second generation, the new Citroen C3 Aircross is based on Stellantis’ new ‘Smart Car’ platform that’s derived from an architecture originally developed for the Indian and South American markets. The same underpinnings are also used on the new and .  It’s also closely related to the new , and is only £1,000 more expensive in the case of the electric model. We thought the electric Vauxhall Frontera was quite the steal at £23,495, but the new Citroen e-C3 Aircross comes in at £500 less. Starting from £22,990, it’s the cheapest you can buy and even a fiver cheaper than a – and that’s for a decent-sized crossover that is ideal for families. The new C3 Aircross is also sold alongside petrol and mild-hybrid versions, which are priced from £20,240 and £23,740, and comes in the choice of two trim levels: Plus and Max, with the latter commanding a £2,000 premium. Unlike the Frontera, alloy wheels are standard, while it comes with a 10.25-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a reversing camera and climate control. The Max trim adds LED rear lights, a black roof, blind spot monitoring and heated front seats – and still less than what a base-spec Nissan Qashqai would set you back. Petrol and hybrid versions can also be had with a third row of seats for a £765 option. Orders are now being taken for the new Citroen C3 Aircross with first deliveries promised in late summer. Inspiration from the innovative back-to-basics concept car is plain to see, especially with its paired-back approach and new lighting signature, which is being rolled out across new Citroens.. You’ll notice how similar the is in shape and structure because the two share a lot of the same tech. As with the C3, the Aircross will feature Citroen’s ‘head-up display’, which is actually the driver’s instruments reflected into a cowling on the top of the dashboard rather than the conventional norm of it being reflected onto the windscreen. The C3 Aircross is available as a petrol, mild-hybrid and an EV, with the cheapest ICE model not offered on the Frontera. The regular petrol model is a 99bhp 1.2-litre turbocharged unit paired to a six-speed manual gearbox, with the hybrid using a 1.2-litre petrol, 48-volt electrical system and six-speed automatic gearbox. If you want the EV, the Citroen e-C3 Aircross uses a 111bhp electric motor and 44kWh LFP battery, equating to less performance and range than the majority of its rivals. Citroen claims a 188-mile range with 100kW DC rapid charging capability enabling a 20 to 80 per cent top-up in less than half an hour. A longer-range e-C3 Aircross with a 250-mile range is due to be introduced later in 2025, however. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
324,Audi U-turns on even-numbered EV and odd-numbered combustion car model names,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/even-odd-model-names/,Jake Groves,2025-02-03,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has announced that it will scrap its plans to name its electric cars with even numbers and its combustion and PHEV models with odd numbers. The brand has confirmed that ‘the previous distinction between different drivetrain technologies according to even and odd model numbers no longer applies.’ That means that, for example, the new will now be joined by an A6 combustion variant that will launch on 4 March. The original plan was for the combustion version to be named A7 to separate powertrain type. The U-turn on splitting up the naming of its cars is meant to ‘represent the size and positioning of each model globally in a unified and transparent way.’ Marco Schubert, Audi’s member of the board for sales and marketing, says: ‘This decision is the result of intensive discussions, and follows the wishes of our customers as well as feedback from our international dealers. We choose the names of our models in a way that reveals size and positioning at first glance.’ Audi says it’s A and Q lettering will still apply to formally separate its conventional cars from its SUVs, and it will still denominate the particular bodystyle with Sportback, Saloon or Avant – should it be required. S and RS shall also remain as per current convention. The news comes not long after Audi quietly dropped the use of its (e.g: an Audi A6 50 TFSI or Audi A3 30 TDI). Power will still be marked with TFSI (petrol), TFSIe (plug-in hybrid), TDI (diesel) or e-Tron – just without the relative (and confusing) two-digit tag.

325,Austrian tuner replaces AMG C63 4cyl PHEV with V8,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/vuk-amg-c63/,Jake Groves,2025-02-07,Car Magazine UK,"VUK Automobile, an Austrian tuner, has thrown the AMG C-Class’ four-cylinder plug-in hybrid powertrain in the bin – and replaced it with a V8. The calls itself a ‘professional Mercedes-AMG tuning house’ and will engineer or upgrade the performance, interior or paintwork of a car you own. The company, which says it has spent two years developing and engineering the to work with an Affalterbach-derived V8, has built one so far for testing. Videos on Instagram have shown the model fully built, as well as subsequent ones that have shown it on a dyno. In one video, VUK Automobile says this is ‘a C63 the way it should be.’ That said, VUK has also put out a statement regarding its C63 V8 swap. The team have said: ‘we want to emphasise that our project would not have been possible without the engineering excellence and components from Mercedes. As a tuning company, we live for performance and individuality, and Mercedes-Benz is the brand that inspires us. ‘Let’s not forget that these decisions [regarding engine choice at the point of production] are made by a few executives and do not represent the entire company or its many talented employees. Instead of criticism, we should celebrate the brand that provides the foundation for builds like ours.’ Images and video show that the V8 used is still an AMG one, which includes the assembler’s signature on the cover. By the sounds of the engine, it’s very likely that the engine is the ‘M177’ 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 from the . While AMG hasn’t completely dropped the V8, with models like the and using it on its own (and using it as part of its hybrid E-Performance powertrain), removing it from the C63 has proven extremely controversial. In fact, AMG head Michael Schiebe has already admitted to CAR that the performance brand from its core C63 model. Rumours have swirled for a while about AMG and Mercedes-Benz possibly returning to use of the V8 in some high-performance models, including the upcoming new CLE 63 – which has been spotted testing at the Nürburgring with a bellowing V8.

326,Volvo EX30 Cross Country: electric SUV dons its welly boots,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volvo/ex30-cross-country/,Tim Pollard,2025-02-10,Car Magazine UK,"The new Volvo EX30 Cross Country follows in a decades-old tradition, whereby the Swedes take their most popular models and winterise them for the famously tough Arctic winters. Volvo was one of the first brands to popularise the soft-roader look with the original V70 Cross Country and latterly XC70 models, alongside Subaru’s tougher Legacy and Forester and Audi’s Allroad estates. Now the Swedes are applying the same thinking to their smallest electric crossover, the . This is a largely cosmetic exercise, but this time Volvo is adding in some actual off-roader-influenced options to equip this Cross Country with some go-anywhere creds. It will be sold as a twin-motor AWD model. The EX30 Cross Country can be ordered with 18-inch all-terrain tyres, as pictured, to give it the scrambling skills to keep going where summer tyre-shod SUVs may slither to a halt. And all CC models come with a higher ride height for better obstacle avoidance. Note also the front grille (above), which has ‘artwork showing the topography of the Kebnekaise mountain range in Arctic Sweden – an inspiration for many of our designers.’ It’s all very postmodern. ‘We launched our first Cross Country car more than 25 years ago, and this concept of durable and all-weather cars is core to the Volvo brand,’ said Jim Rowan, Volvo Cars’ CEO. ‘In Sweden we face harsh winters, but we also like to make the most of them by getting out and exploring our amazing nature, even when it’s minus 20 Celsius outside. That’s why we want to deliver a fully rounded experience, not simply a car, to our EX30 Cross Country customers.’ This explains the roster of pretty serious options pictured, including a roofrack, mudflaps and other accessories more normally found on tougher breeds of Land Rover or Land Cruiser.

327,Why Audi’s genius five-cylinder engine can’t last,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/audi-five-cylinder/,Jamie Turner,2025-02-11,Car Magazine UK,"Audi was the first car brand to make a hero of the five-cylinder engine, promoting the layout on the basis of providing the economy of an inline-four with the refinement of a straight-six in its ’80s ads. But is that true? Most friction in an engine comes from the pistons reciprocating in the bores, so reducing the number of these (or at least their total circumference) will help with fuel economy. It won’t easily get you to four-cylinder levels, though, so Audi was indulging in some advertisement latitude there. As for the other claim, an inline-six has what we call perfect balance but a five only has perfect force balance – it has unbalanced couples of both primary and secondary orders. The primary can be mitigated by a balance shaft and for various reasons the secondary is usually ignored but, again, the five cannot touch a six for smoothness. For the second time, the sales team was not being entirely accurate… However, there was a very pragmatic reason why Audi adopted the arrangement. When you’re mounting your engines longitudinally, in front of the transmission, engine length was very important and a six often won’t fit: five cylinders it was, then. And that gave rise to the inline-five becoming an Audi thing, an almost-USP. And when Audi put a turbo version in the Quattro, legends were born. I say ‘almost’ a USP because the layout isn’t actually unique to Audi. Among others, Volvo, Ford and Fiat have all used it. Between them, they took advantage of its packaging benefits – it’s much easier to fit one transversely in an engine bay than a straight-six. Widespread adoption of balance shafts essentially made all the layouts equal in terms of vibration, giving less concern in this area. But, as turbocharging became more common, other issues manifested for the five. They perform really well as naturally-aspirated engines, because you can adopt long primary exhaust headers which allow great exhaust tuning and therefore avoid pulse interference wrecking the scavenging. A turbocharged inline-five engine, with its 144° firing intervals, a simple, compact exhaust manifold, and high back pressure due to catalysts and silencers, is plagued by pulse interference. This occurs when the valves are still open towards the end of the exhaust stroke and a slug of burned gases gets rammed back into the cylinder – because when the exhaust valves of the next cylinder in the firing order open, a high-pressure wave travels back into the manifold. This creates high levels of trapped residuals in the combustion chamber, and then you end up with all sorts of problems with knock. With turbocharged inline-fours and -sixes you can fairly straightforwardly ‘pulse-divide’ the exhaust, but you cannot with the five. Audi tried to address the issue with different exhaust runner orientations and lengths but the fact is that you cannot solve this challenge without long primary pipes – impossible on turbocharged road engines, for all sorts of emissions-related reasons. So, a roadgoing turbocharged inline-five is hobbled with respect to high specific output and thus, when downsizing began in earnest, the layout was essentially ignored. Audi keeps it alive – for now at least – for emotive reasons of brand heritage. Jamie Turner is a specialist in automotive propulsion, having spent a career in the area spanning industry and academy.

328,"'We won't go mainstream' says Lorraine Bishton, Subaru’s UK MD, as new EVs launch soon",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/subaru/lorraine-bishton/,Jake Groves,2025-02-12,Car Magazine UK,"Subaru is the built tough brand that’s kept itself to itself in the UK for some time. But it is going through the same set of challenges – electrification, mandates, rising costs and changing buying habits – as the rest of the industry. Lorraine Bishton, the brand’s UK managing director, is at the helm of a brand that’s got plenty of history and a shifting future. Bishton has had an expansive career so far. After starting in Ford’s credit department, her move to Jaguar Land Rover included project leading the , developing the and helping set up the Special Vehicle division. After that, Bishton was approached by McLaren to work in its own Special Operations team as sales and marketing director. While in that role, she was the one who introduced then-new boss (and former Ferrari tech lead) to the and worked there while was being developed. As we talk, having , Bishton has been Managing Director of Subaru UK for a year. So, why leave McLaren for Subaru? ‘That’s always a question I get asked! I suppose, given my age, I remember Subaru in the whole Colin McRae era – loved World Rally and touring cars when I was a kid, so it’s a brand I’ve admired for a long time. It’s a brand with amazing heritage. ‘I think everyone’s clear on what Subaru of yesteryear was,’ says Bishton. ‘In recent years, the brand has been in a position where every car that came into the country went straight to a customer, so there was no need to market its cars. But what might have happened in that period is that people aren’t quite so clear on what the brand is today. In other markets like Sweden, we’re known for all-wheel drive capability and the brand is very strong there – people know what it stands for. ‘I’m very keen to reintroduce Subaru to the British public, particularly as we go on that journey of electrification. We’ve got a very loyal customer base, but being able to introduce that to a wider audience and bring new people into the brand is really exciting.’ Subaru customers are fiercely loyal and, as it turns out, rather wealthy. Bishton points out that most Subaru buyers get their car with cash; ‘there’s a stealth wealth element about the brand, where you have people that just want to go into their local town and fly under the radar. We’re also a more rurally-focused brand – you wouldn’t see us advertise in Leicester Square, but you’re more likely to see us supporting local county shows.’ Bishton notes that a large portion of the brand’s dealers are strategically located to better serve rural areas. For now, the brand sells just four models. The old-school three – made up of the Forester, and (formerly XV) – sit beside the , Subaru’s first EV built in partnership with Toyota. Two more EVs are to come for Europe and the UK which will allow Subaru to navigate the UK’s ZEV mandate much clearer, but they won’t replace any of the existing line-up. ‘They’ll be SUVs,’ says Bishton, ‘but I don’t see them in direct competition with our existing cars. They’ll broaden the appeal of the brand.’ But Bishton is keen to point out that introducing these models isn’t about Subaru hitting the big leagues in Europe and the UK. ‘We do plan to grow, but we don’t plan to be mainstream – that’s not what we’re about,’ she says. ‘As we go into next year, we’ll have a six-car lineup in the showroom, which is naturally going to bring more people in. In the case of the Solterra joining, our average customer age is 63, but with Solterra it’s 42.’ Bishton points to these new models being key to ‘introducing Subaru to a new generation of fans.’ What has introduced Subaru to people in the past is its performance names: WRX and STi. But the names are practically dead in Europe and the UK, and arguably on life support in Japan. ‘When you look at the boxer engine and European emissions legislation, those sorts of products just aren’t achievable here,’ says Bishton. ‘But as we move into the era of electrification, that opens up opportunities for the brand.’ ‘Subaru’s a brand that will celebrate its history and heritage, and there’s more we can do about that and we definitely want to take that fan base with us,’ says Bishton. ‘But I think we’re looking to the future with products that are innovative, but still have all the appeal that people know and love from Subaru today.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

The perennial Swedish family SUV is the next car to be aligned with Volvo’s most recent technology and design. Makes sense, then, that the only significant design detail is the new grille – the same one that’s on the . Volvo says new colours and new wheels are available, too, as well as darkened rear light clusters. The biggest difference inside is a new screen, which now stretches out of the top of the dashboard compared to the old one. The upgraded 11.2-inch display remains portrait and includes the latest generation of Volvo’s Google-based infotainment system that’s being rolled out across its cars. Volvo also claims ‘one of the best-sounding audio systems for a car’ is available with its latest Bowers and Wilkins optional system. When the music’s not turned up, Volvo also says this is the quietest XC60 yet with optional air suspension and laminated windows. There aren’t any details on changes to what engines are available, so expect little deviation from the current line-up. The outgoing model was available with a ‘B5’ mild hybrid petrol with 247bhp, ‘T6’ plug-in hybrid powertrain developing 346bhp and claimed up to 50 miles of e-range or ‘T8’ plug-in hybrid with 449bhp and up to 49 miles of electric range.

330,The Spectre Black Badge is the most powerful Rolls-Royce ever,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rolls-royce/spectre-black-badge/,Colin Overland,2025-02-18,Car Magazine UK,"The new Black Badge Spectre is the most powerful production Rolls-Royce car ever. It peaks at 650bhp and 793lb ft, up from the 664bhp and 577lb ft outputs of the regular , the super-luxury electric super-coupe that arrived in 2023 and came close to being the company’s best seller last year. Black Badge is the largely but not entirely cosmetic treatment that Rolls offers as an alternative treatment on most of its models, making them appeal to a generally younger bunch of buyers, many of them buying a Rolls for the first time. In the case of the Spectre, the Black Badge treatment involves new colour options including Vapour Violet, inspired by the neon-lit 1980s and ’90s nightclubs remembered fondly by customers, according to Rolls’ research. There’s a new design of 23-inch wheel. There’s a new backplate behind the grille, in a choice of colours. The steering weight has been increased and roll stabilisation adjusted to give more feedback and less bodyroll. Other Rolls-Royces have Low mode, which is a bit like a sport mode: it increases gearchange speeds, and holds on to lower gears longer when you’re accelerating. But the Spectre doesn’t have a gearbox. As the first electric Black Badge, this presents a whole new world of software-facilitated possibilities. Hence Infinity mode. Press the infinity symbol on the steering wheel and the full 650bhp is available, with more direct throttle response too. And there’s also another innovation, Spirited mode, named after the Merlin engine from the now-separate aero part of Rolls-Royce, as used in the Supermarine Spitfire and elsewhere. In the plane, pushing a switch would give a burst of extra power. In the case of the Black Badge Spectre it’s launch control by another name. You hold the brake and accelerator pedals full down, wait for the signal then release the brake and head for the horizon. The 0-60mph time drops from 4.4 to 4.1sec. Engineering chief Bernhard Dressler said the upgrade was shaped in part by analysing data (accessed with the drivers’ permission) showing how Black Badge cars tend to be driven. Any extra performance is, this research revealed, used only in short bursts. The official WLTP efficiency figure is 2.6-2.8 miles per kWh, with a range of 306-329 miles – in both cases, the same as for the regular Spectre. Actually, use the full torque and power for long and the range will plummet. Does it work? And if so, do the extra flamboyance and performance come at a price? And does it somehow stop the Spectre being a true Rolls-Royce? All being well, we drive it soon.

331,Dazzling Dilemma: a quarter of UK drivers avoid night driving due to blinding headlights,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/uk-headlight-glare/,Paula Cullington,2025-02-18,Car Magazine UK,"It’s a growing issue that’s proving more than just a nuisance –  new research from the RAC reveals that 23% of UK drivers are cutting back on night-time driving due to the discomfort of blinding headlights. The report highlights a sharp increase in complaints about headlight glare, with many motorists feeling the pain of overly bright oncoming lights as they struggle to maintain visibility and comfort during night drives. The issue is hardly new, but its intensity appears to have grown over the past year. The RAC found that 61% of drivers believe the problem has worsened recently, with 75% of those reducing their night driving claiming glare is the main culprit. The concerns are serious, not only affecting comfort but also safety – 49% of those affected by intense headlights say they now feel less secure behind the wheel, and 5% have completely avoided driving after dark. This problem isn’t exclusive to older drivers, with 38% of over-74s are scaling back on their night-time driving, nearly a third (33%) of younger drivers under 35 are also opting out of night-time road trips due to the discomfort caused by overly bright headlights. For many, it’s more than just a matter of irritation. Drivers cite the difficulty in judging the position, speed, and intentions of oncoming vehicles as their main concern, with the majority stating that excessive glare leaves them struggling to make out crucial details on the road. According to data from the Department for Transport (DfT), an average of 280 accidents involving dazzling headlights have been recorded on UK roads each year since 2013. Of these incidents, six annually result in fatalities. Rod Dennis, Senior Policy Officer at the RAC, commented: ‘Bright headlights have evolved from an annoying inconvenience to a genuine safety issue. It’s not just about the momentary flash of being blinded; it’s the difficulty in judging the position and speed of vehicles ahead. ‘It’s remarkable to see how many drivers are scaling back their nighttime driving as a result, underscoring the need for a balanced solution. While there are undoubtedly benefits to brighter headlights, it’s crucial that regulations are reviewed to address the concerns of drivers.’ The RAC points out that the increasing brightness of modern headlights can be attributed to the widespread use of bi-xenon and LED bulbs, replacing traditional halogen units. These advanced headlights deliver a stronger beam that improves visibility for the driver but can also cause significant discomfort for other road users. Misaligned headlights and the rise in SUVs, which tend to sit higher on the road, further exacerbate the glare issue. If you’re among the drivers affected by dazzling headlights, you’re not alone. The Department for Transport (DfT) commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to investigate the causes of headlight glare in October 2024, with findings expected by spring 2025. This research could lead to changes in vehicle lighting regulations, potentially improving your night-time driving experience.

341,Team Enstone’s new era: Alpine F1 boss on 2025 and beyond,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alpine/f1-2025-preview/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-02-27,Car Magazine UK,"F1 testing is our first glimpse of the new cars and drivers on track, but it’s also the first chance for teams to validate their work over the off-season. It’s not just about overall performance, it’s about making sure the simulations and tools back at base correspond to real life. Every team will have something to prove this year, but that particularly goes for Alpine. It’s fair to say last season was a mixed bag for the team from Enstone. It’s had success in the past with both Michael Schumacher (’94 and ’95 as Benetton) and Fernando Alonso (’05 and ’06 as Renault) but those halcyon days felt an age away in 2024. The year began catastrophically, with the team scoring just one point after six rounds. Things were made worse after incidents between the two drivers, Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly, but that was all forgotten after big upturn in results – culminating in a double podium in Brazil. Now, with new team principal Oliver Oakes at the helm – and support from F1 legend – Alpine wants to continue the climb back to winning ways. ‘You could see in the second half of the year, just how much passion there is in the team,’ Oakes, tells CAR at the Alpine’s launch. Taking place in London, it’s a chance to see the new livery before the opening ceremony event later that evening. ‘We have some great people and I think that turnaround is a testament to that,’ he says. Oakes joined Alpine last summer but comes with a racing background. He previously founded the Hitech F2 and F3 team and raced in Formula Renault and GP3 before that. While not as star-studded as the F1 75 event, Alpine’s 2025 launch features some big industry names; Oakes is joined by Briatore – now supporting the team in an executive advisor role – and CEO of Renault Luca De Meo. Also on stage is a gaggle of drivers: Pierre Gasly is paired with new teammate Jack Doohan, but they’re supported by a trio of reserve drivers; fresh from a stunning half a year at Williams, Franco Colapinto is joined by Paul Aron and Ryo Hirakawa. The squad on stage is a very visual reminder of the pressure around F1 drivers, but Oakes believes the quality in and out the car only helps: ‘I think it’s a nice position to be in to have not just Franco, but also Paul and Ryo there to give us options,’ he explains. ‘Having more than one, it does make them be on their toes and raise their game.’ But the drivers are very much at mercy of Alpine’s new racecar. Many teams have kept an eye on 2026 – which will involve big rule changes and opportunities – when developing this year’s car. Others have gone all in for 2025. The new Alpine car represents a balance between the two approaches. ‘Different teams have a different strategy with their resources, with 2026 in mind. I think from us, there’s quite a bit of carryover of the car just because we made that decision very early [last season],’ Oakes admits. ‘But on the first day of testing and the first race, you’ll see quite a bit of development has gone on. In F1 you don’t necessarily see it because it’s under the skin as well.’ The new Ferrari, for example, looks very outwardly different to last year’s car, with an entirely new front suspension system (from pull-rod to push-rod) and very different sidepods among other things. The Red Bull on the other hand, looks similar to its 2024 challenger. ‘We felt as a team, we could deliver [development] and still balance what we’re trying to do for 2026,’ Oakes explains. ‘We do still have a little bit of balancing to do on where we invest, because we aren’t just building for today, we are also building for ’26, ’27 – but that’s part of the fun. However, most important to Oakes is the trackside performance of the team. In simple terms that’s the race strategy, the preparation of the car and the split-second decisions the pitwall has to make throughout the weekend. Oakes pins the success at the end of 2024 to a big improvement on Alpine’s trackside performance. ‘We need to build a good car, but we need to hit the track and deliver results. And I think some of the results the end of last year were testament to that,’ Oakes tells us. ‘We executed good races in difficult conditions. Everyone talks about Brazil, but Qatar (Gasly P5) and Abu Dhabi (Gasly P7) were fantastic as well.’ When the season does get going, the Enstone team will face stiff competition from the other midfield teams: Williams is now resurgent with James Vowles at the helm and Carlos Sainz in the car, while Racing Bulls, Aston Martin and Haas all come into 2025 with exciting driver line ups. It’ll be tough for Alpine to stay where it is – let alone threaten Mercedes, McLaren, Ferrari or Red Bull at the front. ‘We should be there or thereabouts at the front of the midfield. But we know that’s still difficult as well,’ Oakes admits. ‘We’re still carrying quite a few things we wish we had more time, more money in the budget cap to fix, but that’s also the challenge at the moment. ‘We just want to start off where we did last year, and hope we keep closing the gap to the front of the grid.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

342,"Best-sellers from Ford, Volkswagen and Land Rover are the most stolen cars – is your car a theft risk?",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/most-stolen-cars/,Ryan Gilmore,2025-02-28,Car Magazine UK,"Just shy of 54,000 cars were stolen in 2024 here in the UK, and data reveals that the Ford Fiesta is still the most stolen car in the UK.  It’s bad news for other best-selling car owners, the Volkswagen Golf, Ford Focus, Nissan Juke and Vauxhall Corsa also feature on the most stolen car list. This list, revealed by a FOI request to the DVLA by Tempcover, shows that 4,446 Ford Fiestas were stolen in 2024. There’s some positive news with the Focus, thefts are down 24.6% year-on-year from 2023, but the sheer number of Fiestas on the road mean it remains a popular target. It’s positive news for other best-sellers too, with a decrease in thefts for most cars on this list, with a whopping 42.7% fall in thefts for the Mercedes-Benz C Class, even if 1,024 cars were stolen last year. This tracks against an almost 16% drop in overall car thefts, down from 64,087 in 2023. The Nissan Juke was the only top 10 car to see a significant jump in thefts, rising a worrying 61.5% year-on-year. There was a small but notable rise for the Toyota RAV4 too, a car that’s in strong demand overseas. Like with the more premium cars on this list, the likelihood of having a RAV4 nicked is more likely than the bigger-selling Fords. Supply chain issues for spare parts, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine has driven demand for second-hand parts soar, and criminals have capitalised on this. Popular cars always have demand for spare parts, and where manufacturers can’t meet demand, there’s a bustling array of chop shops happy to strip down stolen cars for cash. It’s a full cottage industry of villainy. Increasingly sophisticated car theft techniques have also exposed vulnerabilities in modern cars. Relay attacks against keyless entry systems are a huge concern for modern motorists despite manufacturers fighting back with new measures. These keyless thefts are well-documented and a very quick and non-destructive way of stealing premium cars. The OBDII port is also a backdoor into a car, a savvy thief can reprogramme the car quickly, bypassing the alarm and immobiliser. Fords have been reported to have OBDII vulnerabilities. Own one of these targeted cars, or simply want to ensure your car doesn’t fall into the wrong hands? There are some high- and low-tech steps you can take to ensure that a car isn’t stolen. You can fight back, and we’ve produced a guide on how to stop your car getting stolen. Top tips from us would be to secure your garage if you have one, and if you have a keyless car, to use a Faraday pouch to protect your fob at all times. Physical devices like a wheel lock are also a highly visible deterrent. But don’t ever assume your car is impossible to steal – because the technology designed to protect it can have vulnerabilities.

343,Neue Klasse secrets revealed: BMW unveils new-generation e-motors and batteries,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-neue-klasse/,Ben Miller,2025-03-04,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has just pulled the covers off its next-gen electric powertrains recently, as it gears up to deliver the first of its Neue Klasse cars, , later this year. But the broader plan hasn’t changed. And as world goes to hell in a hand cart, that powertrain plan – i.e.: to develop EVs as well as combustion models and do it mostly in-house – is looking increasingly prescient. ‘We retain our technology-open approach [i.e.: offer all powertrain options and let buyers choose] and our philosophy is the same: production follows the markets, and the supply chain follows the production,’ explains BMW’s Dr Joachim Post, purchasing and supplier network member for the board. But there can be no doubt, either, of the potential for growth if BMW can so something special with this next electric era. Its aware of this, hence the reprisal of the Neue Klasse descriptor. Back then, the original Neue Klasse cars transformed BMW from bit-part player to premium powerhouse. The challenge now? To become synonymous with EV powertrain excellence in the same way it did with great engines. After all, you can count the number of manufacturers with a headquarters that’s also a monument to the four-cylinder engine on the fingers of one finger… A lighter, more efficient and more energy-dense modular toolkit, BMW humbly describes Gen6 as a ‘quantum leap’, as you’d hope given it’ll go into the first electric BMW to wear a proper M badge. The headline claims for the new 800-volt battery technology, which switches from prismatic-type cells to a 46mm lithium-ion cylinders in two lengths (95mm and 120mm) are faster charging (by 30 per cent), a 30 per cent increase in range (with some future models going further still), a 20 per cent increase in overall vehicle efficiency and a massive 40-50 per cent cost reduction versus a comparable Gen5 powertrain. A step-change, then, though some of that progress will go into BMW catching up rather than stretching ahead. Though powerful, the Gen5 kit isn’t the most efficient when compared with some rivals. An we tested in 2023 averaged 2.2 miles per kWh. Across the same roads on the same day, a and managed 4.8 and 4.2 respectively. More recently, has averaged an underwhelming 2.7 miles per kWh. It’s claimed Gen6 also delivers gains in terms of packaging efficiency. The new battery is flatter than before, making it compatible even with low-slung M cars, and is more efficient by design, with no internal modules thanks to its direct, ‘cell-to-pack’ construction. Versus Gen5 packs, the battery’s external mountings are far simpler and lighter, too, and the Neue Klasse cars will use the battery as a stressed member. BMW isn’t making its own cells, naturally, but it is doing virtually everything else in-house. A further five battery production facilities are in the works (five existing plants build the Gen5 batteries), in Bavaria, Hungary, China, Mexico and the US. The Group plant at Landshut is gearing up to produce sufficient ‘Energy Master’ control units (which was developed entirely in-house) to supply those plants, and on the motor side BMW’s Steyr plant is being modified (as part of a cool 1-billion-euro investment) to be able to churn out 600,000 motor units per year. Steyr will also produce the inverters, while the motor casings are being cast at Landshut. Just as different engine architectures better suit different applications, so BMW’s using a mixed approach, with more expensive, high-performance EESM (electrically excited synchronous motor) units on the rear axle and more cost-effective and compact ASM (asynchronous motor) units on the front. In terms of outputs, BMW’s rating the 120kg rear units at 197bhp to 296bhp and the 70kg fronts at 118bhp to 178bhp. Its long been a fan of EESMs for their sustainability (no rare earth metals). It also reckons they’re efficient under part load and powerful at speed. The new units contain a bunch of patented tech and promise quieter and smoother running, a lighter and more rigid housing, big power and torque and reduced losses. As before, they’re self-contained units that bundle together the motor, transmission and the inverter (now silicon carbide; more difficult to make but more efficient). So far, we know Gen6 BMWs will use an EESM motor module on the rear axle and the ASM unit up front, for all-wheel drive, but it has confirmed the Gen6 toolkit can be used to create cars with three or even four e-motors. Though it’s reluctant to discuss about other combinations, two-wheel drive Gen6 cars will likely be rear-wheel drive: ‘It’s in our genes,’ explains Michael Salmansberger, head of electric drive. ‘At BMW we all like the rear-wheel-drive feeling.’  And the fact that BMW’s been running for while would suggest M cars will use the more high-performance EESM units on both axles. With a 50 per cent reduction in production costs on the batteries and 20 per cent on its motor units, does Gen6 promise price parity with piston-engined BMWs? ‘You are successful only if you have the right price for the customer, but you also have to be profitable,’ explains Dr Joachim Post. ‘We must balance these things, and despite the huge cost reduction with Gen6, costs are still the main challenge with electric cars.’ We’ll take that as a maybe. More certain is a new era of performance. Talk to M boss Frank van Meel and he’s always at pains to point out that M is totally embedded within BMW, not merely a tuning shop for its output. As such the division’s involvement in new-platform development begins at the beginning and doesn’t let up: a little more stiffness here, bitte; the scope for a wider track there… ‘When we develop a new technology, we’re always thinking about it from the entry level of the core models right to the high end, and that’s M from a performance perspective,’ confirms Post. ‘M’s requirements are factored in early, so we can get the technology right and scale it for our whole range.’ ‘Frank was not annoying at all,’ smiles Roland Welzmüller, vice president of electric engine technology. ‘M was involved from the very first moment. As you know, right now we have no pure M car in our EV portfolio, and for this new generation we are planning to have M inside this portfolio. So from the very first day of this strategy it was involved, and we have found dedicated solitons for M which we will tell you more about when the time is right. Let me say though that {in terms of power-to-weight ratio] there is no compromise – it will be a real M car. If you are coming from today’s M3, and you are thinking about , customers do not want to have a limitation.’ As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy.

344,EU relents on CO2 emissions targets,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/eu-co2-targets/,Graham King,2025-03-04,Car Magazine UK,"The European Commission has responded to pressure for car manufacturers, announcing proposals to relax CO2 emissions targets that could have resulted in massive fines for non-compliance. A position of technology neutrality will be adopted in the continued push towards net zero, as well. The changes are intended to make the European car industry and its supply chains more resilient – particularly in the face of increased competition from Chinese EV manufacturers such as BYD. The plans will be detailed in full in the Future of the Automotive Industry bill that will be published by the European Commission on Wednesday before being considered in the European Parliament for adoption by the EU. For many years, European car manufacturers have been legally bound by CO2 emissions targets based their fleet average – that’s the average CO2 emissions of all the cars a given manufacturer sells in a calendar year. Failure to meet those targets incurs a hefty fine, potentially billions of euros. The fleet average targets have become a lot stricter for 2025, at 93.6g/km. Initially, manufacturers had to comply with that target in 2025, however the compliance period will be extended to 2027 under the new plans. Many manufacturers had been pressuring the EU to relax what are highly ambitious targets. The regime of ever-lower emissions targets over the coming years remains in place, down to a fully zero-emissions fleet by 2035. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the proposals provide “more breathing space for industry and more clarity, without changing the agreed targets.” Other measures to assist the EV transition are in the Commission’s bill. They include charging infrastructure targets, incentives for EV buyers and a commitment to allowing a range of zero-emissions technology, rather dictating the use of battery-electric vehicles. That opens the way to vehicles powered by alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic fuels. The bill also advocates building trading relationships that ensure robust supply chains of the critical minerals needed for zero-emission vehicles and moving away from dependency on other regions such as China. The EU will also instigate an “industry alliance” where the European motor industry can pool its resources on autonomous vehicles. Von der Leyen said the Commission will develop the rules around testing autonomous vehicles and back large-scale pilot schemes. The changes were announced after a meeting with senior figures from the European motor industry who have voiced their support. A statement released by Stellantis said: “The flexibility introduced regarding CO2 targets, with an extended compliance period, is a meaningful first step in the right direction to preserve the competitiveness of our sector while remaining faithful to the targets and committed to electrification. It is now important that the proposed targeted amendment be turned into law quickly. This initiative, together with further support to targeted purchase and fiscal incentives, cheaper (green) energy and investment into charging infrastructure, can be a real accelerator in the ramp up towards electrification.” Mercedes CEO and European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association president Ola Källenius also welcomed the move but sounded a note of caution: “We appreciate the focus on the proposed CO2 relief measures for 2025 for passenger cars and vans. But let me be clear about our primary concern: how do we chart the course to 2035 with the necessary flexibility and pragmatism to make this transition work? This is the fundamental question we would like to address during the next strategic diaglogue with the Commission.” The UK’s current zero-emissions vehicle mandate remains in place unchanged, thus manufactures are legally required to sell an ever-growing proportion of electric cars each year up to 100% in 2030. Under pressure from manufacturers, in November seeking input on how the mandate could be made more equitable while still achieving its ultimate goal. We have yet to see the results of that consultation. If the Commission’s bill is adopted by the EU, the UK government won’t necessarily follow suit. However, changes at the EU level could make the UK’s position untenable. We asked both the Department for Transport and Society of Manufacturers and Traders for comment but, at the time of writing, they have yet to respond.

345,Volvo ES90: a saloon for Gothenburg’s electric era,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volvo/es90/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-03-05,Car Magazine UK,"► The Volvo saloon is back – but not as we know it. You’re looking at the ES90, the latest EV from Volvo – and the second on its box-fresh SPA2 platform. It’s not that obvious from the pictures here, but it’s long – around 5m in length with a wheelbase of 3.1m – and it’s higher than the average saloon too, with a ride height chosen for accessibility as well as overall presence. Like the shown earlier this year, it’s also a hatchback masquerading as a saloon, for practicality’s sake. This is the spiritual successor to the S90 saloon, then, but crafted for modern consumer demands. It also follows the as the second software-defined car from Volvo. In the same way that Apple controls the hardware and software of its products to reduce fragmentation and provide quicker, more effective updates, Volvo is unifying the tech stack across its products for the same reason. ‘The Volvo ES90 combines our most advanced technologies with Scandinavian design and superior comfort, creating a true premium Volvo car designed to elevate your quality of life,’ said Jim Rowan CEO of Volvo. ‘It joins the SUV as one of our flagship models and cements our position as an industry leader in software-defined cars that harness the power of core computing.’ At a limo-like 5m long, the ES90 is indeed large and robust-looking in the metal. That’s partly because of the tech underneath, but also because it’s been designed to project the safe, robust qualities Volvo has always been known for into the electric age. ‘Volvos have always had this very stoic, practical, durable aesthetic,’ Jeremy Offer, Volvo’s head of global design, tells CAR at an early preview of the ES90 in Sweden. ‘How do we then move that on, when aerodynamics start to come into play?’ The answer? By creating a design language that looks as solid and techy as possible – whilst still cutting through the air with a respectable amount of drag (a slippery 0.25 Cd is claimed, helping eke out every extra mile of range). Volvo calls the new style ‘machined from solid.’ ‘How can you tell amongst all of the cars that are on the road, that this is the safest car of them all?’ asks Offer. ‘By really carefully considering what it is that makes a car look, as well as feel, safe. The idea is that the ES90 feels like it is, and looks like it is, machined from a billet or block of aluminium, rather than pressed from sheet metal.’ If that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the design ethos of modern Apple Macbooks, which are largely forged from a single piece of aluminium. The ES90’s Lidar assistance systems and sensors are exposed and prominent, positioned high above the windscreen. That’s partly because it’s the most effective location for Lidar sensors to get a good view of the road ahead, but also because Volvo’s designers wanted the ES90 to wear its safety features proudly. Elsewhere you’ll see the latest iteration of Volvo’s ‘Thor’s Hammer’ headlight motif, and new C-shaped lamps at the rear which echo the original S90’s. New for this EV are slatted LED lamps which peep out of the rear window edges – and almost make the ES90 look like an estate from far away. As you’d expect, they’ll be used for goodbye and hello animations upon start-up and when parked. Boot space is claimed at 424 litres, growing to 733 litres if you flop the rear seats down. There’ll be seven paint colours to choose from, and the EV will roll on one of four wheel options, ranging between 20- and 22 inches in diameter. The ES90 runs on the Swedes’ latest SPA2 platform, so it’s a twin to the Volvo EX90 SUV and a half sibling to the Polestar 3. Or something like that. Either way, it uses the same ‘Superset tech stack’ as the SUV. In simple terms, both cars use the same set of hardware and software modules, so over-the-air updates can be streamlined and pushed to both models in one fell swoop when new software versions and features are ready. The result? Updates are quicker to develop and can be pushed out to a much larger number of cars. What’s more, feedback from those cars is more relevant, so can be processed more quickly to influence further updates (with the users’ permission). It’s a virtuous circle, claims Volvo. At the heart of the new tech stack is a duo of Nvidia Drive AGX Orin chips. Designed to power all aspects of the car’s technology, they make the ES90 the most intelligent Volvo yet, according to its makers. ‘That makes [the ES90] the most powerful car we have ever created in terms of core computing capacity,’ says Anders Bell, Volvo’s chief engineering and technology officer of the new chips. ‘This allows us to further raise the bar on safety and overall performance through data, software and AI.’ Such are the benefits of the new ‘double Orin’ tech stack, that Volvo has pledged to upgrade retrospectively the less powerful chip configurations in early EX90s and Polestar 3s. Doing so keeps the SPA2 cars on the same level, preventing fragmentation. Eventually, all EX90 and Polestar 3 products will roll off the production line with the latest chips – but Volvo won’t confirm when that’ll happen. The ES90 will be available in a total of three trims, all of which are coming to the UK: there’ll be a range-topping twin-motor Performance model, a twin-motor ES90 and finally a single-motor. The range-topping Performance model will develop 500kW (671bhp) and 642lb ft of torque from a 106kWh battery and two motors. The standard 0-62mph sprint will take just 4.0 seconds, says Volvo, while electric range should be 435 miles. Charging time will be 20mins when going from 10-80%, with ultra-rapid 350kW charging (if you can find it in the UK… good luck). The mid-range dual-motor Volvo ES90 gets the same 106kWh battery, but instead delivers 330kW (443bhp) and 494lb ft of torque. Range is 435 miles, the same as the Performance, as is the charging time. The entry-level ES90 will kick off with a single 245kW (329bhp) motor on the rear axle, paired with a smaller 92kWh battery. That’ll get you a 0-62mph sprint of 6.9 seconds, and a WLTP range of 404 miles. Charging time will take 30mins when plugged into a 350kW charging station. Top speed is capped at 112mph (180kmh) across all three cars, though towing capacity varies: it’s 2000kg for the twin-motor models, and 1600kg for the entry-level model. All three ES90 models benefit from third-party software from Breathe Battery Technologies, a company which helps to cut charging times. The Volvo ES90 is underpinned by 800-volt technology, whereas the EX90 it’s twinned with currently does not. Volvo says that the later EX90s will get the same 800v tech as the ES90 in time – something early adopters should rightly be frustrated about. And unlike with the chip situation, early EX90s obviously can’t be upgraded to 800v circuitry. One to bear in mind with showroom decision making… The new Volvo ES90 will go on UK sale in March 2025, but into production in late summer 2025 with the first UK cars arriving in the first quarter of 2026. CAR understands UK pricing should start around £70,000 and Brits can expect to be offered in Plus and Ultra trim levels, with top-spec cars weighing in at £88,000.

346,"2025 UK car tax bands: everything you need to know about the VED price hike next month",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/car-tax-road-tax-ved-uk-prices-cost/,Ryan Gilmore,2025-03-05,Car Magazine UK,"Only two things in life are certain: death and car tax. It’s a modern reality that motoring isn’t free – and in this guide we explain how Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), also known as car tax and road tax, works with all the changes coming on 1 April 2025. It’s now been a decade since physical tax discs were abolished in favour of digital taxation, in a measure to chop down on government spending. VED is still a major source of revenue to the UK Treasury and the autumn 2024 budget shook things up for all motorists. Gone is free road tax for , and most cars that contribute any CO2 at all are now facing a substantial price hike in annual road tax. Read on to learn all about the changes coming in the next few weeks, and just how VED works in 2025. Cars in Great Britain are taxed based on their CO2 emissions, but the age of the car is also taken into consideration when the VED car tax band is calculated. And there is also a difference between taxing a brand new car being registered for the first time (known as the first-year rate) and one that’s already on the road. We’ll explain both types in this explainer. In this guide we will attempt to explain all the most likely road tax scenarios. First step is to establish your vehicle’s age and CO2 emissions; both are recorded on your car’s V5C registration document from the DVLA – it’s the paperwork you were sent when you first purchased the car. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are quoted in grammes per kilometre (g/km) and record how efficient your vehicle is. A car with 90g/km is pretty clean; a gas guzzler may well top 300g/km or 400g/km. It can get a bit complicated. Here we explain how much you’ll pay whether you’re taxing a brand new car, a nearly new one or an old banger. Read on for our full explainer for how car tax works in Britain. If you are buying a brand new car from 1 April 2025, you’ll pay the new first-year rates of VED. These vary from a tenner for EVs, all the way up to £5490 for a highly-polluting or Rolls-Royce Phantom. EVs used to get a free ride in the name of incentivising take-up, but that’s all ending from April 2025 as adoption grows. The taxation rate for EVs is still far below the rate for any vehicle with an engine, mind. Find out your vehicle’s CO2 emissions in the first column and then read across, depending on whether your car is powered by petrol, diesel or alternative fuels (LPG or CNG autogas). If you’re reading this on your phone, you might need to flip your screen to horizontal landscape to fit it all on the screen. That’s the first-year cost to tax your car. Then it gets even more complicated. Road tax in subsequent years is charged at a different rate – depending on the original list price of your car. You have been warned… Ready to consider your second-year tax on a new car? Good. Check out our table below to see what you’ll pay – and remember, this only applies if your new car cost less than £40,000 when you first purchased it. That’s the full RRP list price including any options, not a haggled, discounted price. There are thee current rates of road tax, but remember these will rise with inflation from April 2025: Ah yes. Bit of a killer this one: if your new car has a list price (including options and extras) of more than £40,000 at the time of purchase, you’ll have to pay even more. This is known as the ‘luxury car supplement,’ but is also known as the showroom tax. And you can’t haggle it down – the tax is charged on the quoted list price of your chosen model, including all optional equipment. This figure has been frozen since its introduction, and the recent inflation jump now means a mid-spec will count as a luxury car, once EVs are subject to the tax from April 2025. In fact, we’ve spotted both Vauxhall and Tesla reduce prices on EVs to slip under this threshold, so be sure to check the latest list prices. We ran the original £40,000 figure through an inflation calculator and it spat out £52,400 in today’s money. If only the threshold for the tax went up in line with inflation, as VED does… These rates apply in years two, three, four and five – so you’ll have to pay an extra £410 per year: Still with us? Good. Any car registered between 2001 and 2017 will pay a flat rate of VED car tax, depending on its CO2 emissions – but here price doesn’t come in to it. The cleanest cars in Band A paid nothing, whereas the dirtiest in Band M were clocking up more than £700 a year. So check out the table below to see how much your car tax will be: So taxing some older, interesting cars such as a secondhand Porsche 911 (below) could get pricey… Ah, the good, old-fashioned way to tax your car… Back in the day, road tax was calculated purely on engine size – and the magic cubic capacity was 1.5 litres. Check out our table here to see how much an older car will cost to tax (conveniently, this was introduced just as the UK’s new registration system was ushered in, with the Y-reg plate). And that’s it. Complicated, isn’t it? We hope you’ve found our guide to British road car tax useful. Read on for some popular questions about road tax and VED. You can check if your vehicle is taxed and can be driven on the road on this handy It’s very easy to cancel your VED if you sell your car. If you pay by Direct Debit, it will be cancelled automatically; if you paid a one-off fee, the DVLA will automatically refund any full months left to run on your car tax. . Sadly not. You used to be able to pass your VED on to the next buyer when you sold your car. But this was stopped in 2017. You must now apply for a refund – and the buyer will have to tax the car from scratch from the moment they drive off the forecourt. Gone are the days of throwing in ‘six months road tax included’ to sweeten a secondhand car sale. If you know you won’t be driving your car on the road for a considerable length of time, you must apply for a Statutory Off Road Notification, or SORN, if you don’t want to pay road tax. . The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the government body responsible for car and road tax in the UK. Contact details are listed on the . Company car tax is a completely separate tax, designed to reflect the perk of having a company-provided business car. Note that you will have to pay for road tax as well. We recommend using the to see how much benefit-in-kind tax you’ll pay on any business-provided car. Cars first registered before 1 January 1985 are currently exempt from paying VED, as of 1 January 2025. This rolling threshold advances every year, so all cars made before 1 January 1986 will be exempt from 1 January 2026. You need to apply for this road tax exemption, and . Other exemptions include disabled motorists, mowers, agricultural vehicles doing less than 1.5km on road between fields, and steam engines.

347,ID. Every1: your first look at VW’s future first car – an EV for £17k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-every1/,Piers Ward,2025-03-05,Car Magazine UK,"Say hello to what could become your child’s first car. Polo, Golf and Beetle before those two… Volkswagen has had more of a hand than most in getting people into their first car and the company is hoping that the ID. Every1 concept it’s just unveiled will be the blueprint for more of the same. It’s difficult to overstate how important this car is to Volkswagen. This concept previews what will be an actual car in 2027, where the production ID. 1 will become the starting point to VW’s electric range and should begin at just £17,000. In an era when we’re all singing the praises of for kicking things off at £22,995, that is quite some bargain. The ID. Every1 is slightly smaller, admittedly, than an R5; it’s more a four-seat city car following on from the Lupo and e-Up. Front-wheel drive, the car sits on the same MEB platform that will underpin the ID. 2 models but the key to the price point is ever better technology and economies of scale. Thomas Schäfer, boss of VW, recently told me that ‘as electrification progresses and the work on the battery cells, the chemistry and the formats have progressed… you get a real trajectory for the battery cost that enables small car electrification. ‘You need scale for it, in order to get it done… To get a business case going, you need numbers and you technology that you can scale.’ Not that it’s all plain sailing. ‘If you look at it only from profit maximisation, walk away from it [the city car EV]. I’d rather do large SUVs.’ Despite this, there aren’t any current plans for either Seat, Cupra or Skoda to build their own version of the ID. 1. Clearly there’s flexibility. Volkswagen’s chief technical officer, Kai Grünitz, explained that VW didn’t plan for the ID. 1 to rely on very high volumes but rather to build in adjustability depending on how the market is going. If people want more ID. 2s, they can build more of them – the factories can be tailored to suit. There are clever design touches that keep costs low, like the lack of any additional body cladding or the way the rear door is made from a single piece of sheet metal. Design boss Andreas Mindt told me that he wants to ‘turn affordable into beautiful’. A few. VW promises that the concept can reach 80mph and is powered by a new electric motor that produces 94bhp, with a range of over 155 miles. It’s very much a city car that could just about keep up on the motorway. Size-wise, it sits between the Up and current Polo, with VW promising enough room for four adults (not unrealistic, given the packaging advantages that an EV brings) and a boot volume of 305 litres. To put that in context, the current has 210 litres. A new software architecture is promised, crucial in allowing the production ID. 1 to continue to develop through its life cycle. This is where the joint venture with Rivian will start to bear fruit, where Volkswagen taps into the US manufacturer’s software knowledge and its ability to control more of the car from one central brain, a bit like BMW’s Heart of Joy. Grünitz, talks of a zonal electronic architecture that is scalable depending on the sort of model it’s fitted to – a basic ID. 1 might get just the one zone, the ID. 7 more like three. The point is that it’s entirely flexible and comes from the same starting point, so VW doesn’t have to start the process all over again each time a new model is launched. It’s not quite clear yet as to what the production car will be called. The ID. Every1 name is just for the concept and the senior team at VW have recently been suggesting that the ID name could be retired in favour of the brand’s more famous badges, such as Golf, Polo and Up. Whether this is the car to make that transition remains unclear. What is clear, though, is that it’s part of a VW renaissance under Schäfer: nine new models are promised by 2027 and we should see the production version of later in 2025.

348,Alpine’s motorsport takeover: we talk strategy with the Renault Group boss,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alpine/renault-and-motorsport-2025/,Curtis Moldrich,2025-03-06,Car Magazine UK,"► In 2025 Alpine seems to be everywhere you look. Like just a handful of brands such as Ferrari and Aston Martin in compete both in F1 and World Endurance Racing – but unlike both of those marques, Alpine also finds itself in MotoGP. This year the Alpine A runs on . It’s all a part of a wide-ranging and confusing (at least to the layman) strategy to build up Renault’s revived sport brand ahead of a wave of mostly electric cars. But it seems to be working. ‘We multiplied sales by three with the same car (the A110) at the end of the lifecycle,’ Renault boss Luca de Meo tells CAR at the . ‘Normally cars at the end of their life go [down], but we actually multiplied by three.’ As fizzy and unique as the is, it’s in the past, with a recent range refresh the final chapter in Alpine’s lightweight hit. More crucial for Renault Group’s balance sheet is the wave of Alpine EVs on the horizon; the , itself a hot version of the is already here, and it’ll be followed by a larger due to arrive later this year. I just wanted to make the thing work financially,’ says de Meo of Renault Group’s involvement in F1. ‘We did a couple of moves by separating the powertrain, and getting a new supplier, plus all the work we’re doing on the cost structure, plus the support that we get in from sponsors,’ he adds. ‘I think this is more than acceptable for a group like Renault.’ It’s been money well spent. F1 and its ever-growing audience has already played a role in putting the Alpine brand in front of consumers around the globe. ‘If you calculate the value of the Alpine brand today compared to around four years ago, it’s multiplied by three,’ de Meo tells us. ‘Formula One is a huge booster for awareness at least, if not position. I think it was a very good marketing investment.’ It’s only getting better. is an example of the step change in popularity F1 has experienced; powered by Drive to Survive and a longer more global calendar, it’s been able to return more reach than ever for the team’s involved. de Meo wants to keep that value there. ‘Formula one is the pinnacle of the automotive industry, so you want to see yourself competing with Ferrari, Mercedes etc rather than some funky names,’ he tells us. Opening [F1] up too much is not good, because we need to care about the value of the franchise. Restricting the numbers of teams is very important to make sure that the valuation of these teams goes in the right direction.’ All sporty brands launching EVs and SUVs need an unattainable hypercar to keep them desirable: Alfa Romeo has the , Lotus the Evija and soon Alpine will have the . It sounds like a sustainable muesli, but it should be a weapon when it does arrive: ‘We’re looking at a combustion engine,’ confirms de Meo of the hypercar – although EV and hydrogen power has been bandied about in the past. ‘We’re looking at something that is beyond 700 horsepower or something like this.’ It’ll be road legal, but as you’d expect, produced in very limited numbers because ‘we do it for the fun.’ But Alpine isn’t Renault Group’s only sports brand. Renault Sport has existed for a similar amount of time and arguably has more historical cache than the Alpine brand which has overtaken it. ‘Officially, the Renault Sport Badge, was put it in the fridge’ de Meo reminds us ‘We decided that everything that would go on sports things would be building on Alpine, because we need to do that.’ Enter the , a 500hp, rear-wheel-drive beast, labelled an ‘insane product and mini supercar,’ by the Renault boss just minutes later. Where does that fit in? According to de Meo, it makes perfect sense: ‘The Renault Five Turbo was never an Alpine – it was a Renault,’ he responds when asked about the badge on the new hot hatch. ‘If you want to do something authentic then you’ve got to respect the history of the thing.’ With that in mind, it’s possible we’ll see more Renault Sport products on the way, as like many other brands Renault looks to combine electric vehicle technology with pure nostalgia. ‘We have ideas on how to revive some of the iconic products of the past,’ he adds. So there you have it; Alpine will maintain its position as the sporty brand in both products and marketing, with historic products returning in a Renault Sport guise when appropriate because it’d be plain wrong to do anything else. ‘It makes sense right,’ he reminds us. ‘We do competition, we do gentleman driver things, we do turismo, we do Formula One. It makes just sense as a strategy discipline to put it onto the Alpine label,’ he says. Apart from when it doesn’t, of course… Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
349,Audi’s new plan? Nail the normal stuff,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/audi-s-new-plan/,Georg Kacher,2025-03-07,Car Magazine UK,"► Just what is Audi for? Poor financial figures look like a symptom of an identity crisis at the car maker once renowned for low-key excellence. Sales are down. It’s invested heavily in getting new all-electric cars to market at a time when interest in EVs is waning. It’s planning to lose engineers as a way to cut costs – but that risks slowing the development of much-needed new cars. Any company can survive downturns in sales, market share and profitability – and Audi is far from alone among European car makers in finding the going pretty choppy at the moment. But what’s more worrying is the suspicion that its commitment to engineering excellence may not be what it once was, and the perception that Audi is no longer clear what it stands for, within the premium car market and within the VW Group. There are reasons to be optimistic. The man in charge at Audi, former Porsche executive Gernot Döllner, who took over from Markus Duesmann in September 2023, has a good working relationship with VW Group boss Oliver Blume. Döllner has, we understand, given a clear brief to Massimo Frascella – who took over from Marc Lichte as chief creative officer in June 2024 – to avoid vague future-gazing and instead create a down-to-earth show car that points to a production vehicle. Sales are down in Europe, China and the US, and the thousands of jobs at risk include many R&D specialists – the people who should be working on the engineering solutions that will restore some of the shine to Audi’s tarnished reputation for quality. Looking to the near future, Döllner has split development work between seven teams, each focused on a group of related products. For instance, one group’s efforts are centred on the MEB and MQB platforms, which between them should provide the next generation of electric and combustion replacements for the A1, Q2, A3 and other modestly sized products. At the other extreme, a different group is tasked with creating the future electric A8. Insiders expect a new electric Q2 crossover in 2026 and the following year an all-electric A3 replacement (to be badged A2, under Audi’s new naming convention, where odd numbers have engines and evens are all electric). The project referred to internally as C-Sport is what’s left of Audi’s ambitions for a sports car, a sister of the battery-powered Cayman and Boxster. Stuttgart’s future clean-air two-seaters have apparently come in way over budget, and the target retail price is now a stiff €130,000. As a result, Audi has not yet confirmed its C-Sport spinoff. Other projected sports cars, including the R8 replacement, have been mothballed, and the next-generation e-Tron GT – to be twinned with 2028’s second-generation SSP-based Porsche Taycan – is currently on hold. Another interesting potential newcomer is – the capital Q stands for a new quattro all-wheel-drive system with up to three e-motors, stacked suspension, four-wheel steering and off-road-biased torque vectoring. Co-developed with Magna, the 800-volt HardQore shares its ladder-frame chassis, electronic architecture and key drivetrain elements with the SUV and pick-up from Scout, the heritage workhorse brand revived by VW; a four-cylinder range-extender petrol engine driving the live rear axle will also be on offer. The South Carolina plant, which has a projected annual capacity of 200,000 units, could in principle also accommodate the still nameless Audi derivative due in 2027 or 2028. It’s believed to be a three-row, high-end metal-top priced one or two notches below the Mercedes G-Class and imminent electric Range Rover. But there’s a glitch: like the C-Sport, the HardQore project has not yet had the necessary investment assigned to it. One of Lichte’s most compelling future Audis, designed before his departure, is the RS Allroad, with big wheelarches and a rugged overall look. It will be available as a hybrid, petrol or diesel engines but not EV. That sounds very appealing – and very do-able. In common with all VW brands except perhaps Bentley and Lamborghini, Audi needs to tighten its belt and concentrate on profitable volume-sellers like 2028’s A4 e-Tron, which was Lichte’s final effort before Frascella arrived from JLR. Straight-bat cars like that will be prioritised over emotional niche models – no more coupes, no more convertibles or roadsters, no confirmed new sports car. Also due for the chop are the barely profitable A1, the stillborn Q1 and the non-e-Tron Q8. It will be a shame to see the back of sportier and wilder Audis, if that’s the way the belt-tightening strategy manifests itself. But maybe that’s exactly what Audi needs right now: to get back to the sort of cars that made its reputation in the first place.

350,Morgan Supersport revealed as new flagship – and it’s designed to be used every day,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/morgan/supersport/,Ted Welford,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Morgan is back with a new flagship sports car, and it’s called the Supersport. Said to be its most usable and refined  model ever, the firm hopes buyers will use them cars all year round. It indirectly replaces the , which will soon end production and is Morgan’s first true flagship since the bowed out in 2018. We’ve spent time with the top brass at Morgan to give you the full lowdown on its new Supersport. It’s safe to say more is new than what might initially meet the eye. The Supersport uses a CXV aluminium platform (rather than the Plus Six’s CX), and the car has principally been designed to be Morgan’s best-driving car ever. No style over substance here. The project has been led by Matt Hole, managing director of Morgan since October 2024, but who originally joined the Malvern-based sports car maker as chief technical officer in 2021 and oversaw much of the car’s development. ‘It’s a new car from the ground up,’ says Hole. ‘The geometry has fundamentally changed, we’ve taken universal joints out of the steering rack to give it a a more direct feel. Everything has been fundamentally revised, and it’s even had to be crash-tested again.’ It’s the first Morgan to sit on Michelin tyres and the chassis is 10 per cent stiffer than the Plus Six – and another 10 per cent on top with the optional carbon-fibre fitted, designed to be a structural element, and not just to keep the, ahem, elements out. The roof is the only panel not made of aluminium, but don’t worry there’s still plenty of ash built into the Supersport’s frame. ‘It’s a step improvement. We wanted a car that could sit in a group test and can sit well against them,’ says Hole. One thing that’s not changed from the Plus Six to the Supersport is the engine, with Morgan retaining its BMW-sourced B58 unit. Its three litres and six cylinders put out 335bhp and 369lb ft of torque allowing a 3.9-second 0-62mph top speed, and a 166mph top speed if you’re feeling brave. An eight-speed ZF ‘box remains the default, with no manual available. The engine is the only ‘off the shelf’ element of the new car, with Morgan proud of the efforts it has gone in having new parts made for the Supersport – the headlights, for example, have historically been a shared component, whereas new clusters have now been specifically made this time around. A Morgan is unlikely to be bought for its everyday usability, but the firm is proudly claiming it now can be enjoyed all year round. Big improvements have been made to NVH including seats which ‘no longer vibrate’ (yes, really) and are far more comfortable. There are new latches that make it easier to take out the side screen windows. Morgan considered taking these out altogether but owners love the open-air feel, so a ‘conscious decision’ was made to keep them. But perhaps the main thing to note is that it’s the first Morgan in more than a decade to have a boot, with room for two squashy bags and the sidescreens when not in use. The boot also contains an exposed section of ash – with the firm particularly pleased it’s been able to get this visible nod to its use of wood rather than it simply being integrated into the chassis. Hole said it was really important for Morgan to have a car that can ‘be used as much of year-round as possible’. ‘If you’ve got such a beautiful and interesting car in your garage, it would be great to use it for as much of the time as possible.’ Hard to disagree, right? The Supersport unsurprisingly still looks like a Morgan, though isn’t quite the step change like the Aero 8 when it debuted to the rest of the line-up. The new car draws much of its inspiration from the – a barchetta revealed in 2024, partly designed by Pininfarina and produced to celebrate the sports car firm’s coachbuilding, and limited to just 50 units. The most controversial design element is a new rectangular grey panel at the front. Though the development of the Supersport started before the Midsummer, various elements are shared between the two cars. There’s a greater focus on aerodynamics with an extended rear body and more aggressive-looking front end courtesy of its darkened horseshoe grille and lower grey splitter. Traditional Morgan bonnet louvres are no longer present, and while the carbon-fibre hardtop is available, it’s an option and the Supersport comes stock as a roadster. Most buyers so far have chosen the roof, though. While many will buy a Morgan for its lack of mod-cons, there are increasingly features that buyers don’t want to live without. The firm promises a phone call can be held in ‘perfect clarity while travelling with the roof down’ courtesy of new microphones and advanced noise cancelling. It’s a bold claim if you’ve ever driven a Morgan at a decent lick of pace and been subject to the wind noise. There’s even wireless smartphone charging in the redesigned centre console area with a special area where a smartphone can be placed so you can use it for navigation while driving. Just a coincidence, Morgan promises… With the Plus Six now discontinued, the Supersport arrives to fill up the gap at the top of the range – with obvious differences between the and , both of which sit at a very different price point. Jonathan Wills, head of design at Morgan, tells us the Supersport project formally started in 2022 but that it’s been going on in the background for far longer. ‘It’s something we’ve been imagining since before the acquisition by Investindustrial, probably as far as back in 2019. When the Aero left, we asked if there was a void that could be filled with a new flagship. In one form or another as a sketch or a concept, we’ve been gently developing it since then.’ Production of the Supersport will get underway imminently at Morgan’s Worcestershire HQ, with prices starting from £102,000, with the first dealer demos available from mid-April.

351,Nissan boss Makoto Uchida steps down after Honda merger talks fail,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/nissan-honda-merger/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan’s president and CEO, Makoto Uchida, has stepped down after talks to merge with Honda collapsed in February 2025. Uchida’s replacement is Ivan Espinosa, the brand’s chief planning officer, who will take the reins on 1 April. The Nissan brand has faced years of dwindling sales and general industrial decline, which resulted in the brand looking to Honda for a ‘strategic integration.’ However, after talks kickstarted in December 2024, both brands announced they would be terminated in February 2025. After the talks had been announced, reports had surfaced of irreconcilable differences between the two companies. A statement confirming the termination of the ‘memorandum of understanding’ says: ‘Honda proposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding company, where Honda would appoint the majority of directors and the chief executive officer based on a joint share transfer as initially outlined in the MOU, to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchange. ‘As a result of these discussions, both companies concluded that, to prioritise speed of decision-making and execution of management measures in an increasingly volatile market environment heading into the era of electrification, it would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU.’ Reading between the lines, the statement seems to imply that Honda’s proposal for being the lead company wasn’t a satisfactory one. Instead, the two brands will ‘collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companies.’ On the same day the talks were finished, Nissan announced its own efforts to help fix its worrying balance sheets. The brand says it will intend to save 400 billion yen by cutting around 2500 jobs; ‘indirect’ roles will be removed ‘by streamlining operations, implementing hiring reductions, and accelerating voluntary separation programs.’ Elsewhere, Nissan confirms its will launch this year to help its product portfolio in several markets, as well as a new compact EV and new plug-in hybrids launching in 2025 and 2026. Managing an angry, ailing Nissan was a distraction Honda couldn’t afford at a time when it needs to prioritise countering the threat from China’s increasingly competent and accomplished car makers. The problem is cultural. Japan’s automotive industry remains siloed and insular; few executives move between companies. And Japanese car makers have a poor understanding of brands – the relative failure of Honda’s Acura and Nissan’s Infiniti luxury divisions are a case in point. What’s more, Honda has long been one of Japan’s most singular car makers; echoes of founder Soichiro Honda, that stubborn and iconoclastic engineer, still resonate through the company’s culture. Honda can only view Nissan through the prism of its own experience. And it has likely struggled to understand what it has seen. The signals from the top while the talks were ongoing weren’t encouraging. ‘That’s a difficult one,’ Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe confessed when asked in a press conference why Nissan would make a good business partner. The announcement that Honda and Nissan were initially discussing merging their operations into a single joint holding company by August 2026 should have been accompanied by lots of frothy talk of synergies and efficiencies and improved profitability. After all, a merged Honda and Nissan (including Mitsubishi, in which Nissan has a controlling stake) would have been the third largest car maker in the world after Toyota and VW. Instead, the proposed deal had the gritted-teeth vibe of a shotgun wedding. And there’s no doubt about who held the shotgun: Japan’s powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), which doesn’t want ailing Nissan to fall into the wrong hands. Be in no doubt: Nissan’s in big trouble. Operating profit collapsed 90 per cent in the six months to the end of September last year. But Honda has problems too. It’s frantically playing catch-up in electric vehicles, its market share in China is shrinking, and the brand has a low profile on European roads. On paper, though, there were potential synergies if the deal came together. One of Japan’s oldest car makers, Nissan, was long regarded as the best in terms of its manufacturing capability. It was also the most expansionist, building its first factory outside of Japan in 1966, in Mexico. As a result, Nissan has a bigger global manufacturing footprint that could in theory have helped Honda in markets such as Europe and Africa. It has a mixed record in terms of product, however: the landmark Nissans, cars such as the Z cars and the Skyline GT-Rs, were conceived by maverick executives such as Yutaka Katayama, the first president of Nissan Motor Corporation USA, and Shin’ichiro Sakurai, the talented engineer Nissan acquired when it was asked to take over the failing Prince Motor Company in 1966. Mainstream Nissans have tended to be worthy but dull: tough and durable vehicles with little charisma. And that’s where Honda could have helped. If Nissan epitomises Japan’s automotive establishment, Honda has always been something of an outsider. While wealthy Nissan was planning to build an imposing new headquarters building on Tokyo’s prestigious Ginza, motorcycle-making Honda was racing to beat a 1961 decree from METI’s predecessor that any company not building cars by 1963 would not be permitted to enter the sector. Honda builds more internal combustion engines – about 20 million a year, for cars, motorcycles, boats and lawnmowers, among others – than any other company on the planet. Electric motors simply aren’t part of its engineering DNA. And though Nissan inexplicably managed to squander the first-mover advantage offered by the Leaf, which went into production two years before Tesla’s Model S, it could help Honda with EV development and manufacturing. The humiliation will run deep at Nissan, a company that long regarded itself as Japan’s elite car maker. However, playing second fiddle to Honda won’t be as humiliating as having been rescued in 1999 by Renault, says a former European Nissan executive who spent years working in Japan. ‘They never got over the fact they were bailed out by westerners,’ he says, ‘and that a western management team did a better job of running Nissan than they could themselves.’ Moreover, though a merger with Honda would have helped both companies more efficiently invest in new products and new technologies, it may not have necessarily solved Nissan’s existential crisis. ‘I hate to be critical of current management,’ says a former Nissan insider, ‘but they’ve done nothing to define what the hell Nissan is and why it deserves to exist.’ Honda, seemingly, has been unlikely to figure that out, either.

352,Jaguar's Type 00 concept: now available in blue,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jaguar/type-00/,Ben Miller,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"This, then, is it – Jaguar’s brave new world made real. and we have, ad nauseam, discussed advert. But now the talking stops, at least for a moment. The Type 00 – the first car of Jaguar’s new era – is here. After launching in a bombastic pink in the launch images, it’s time for the Jag brand to keep the hype train going ahead of the production car’s reveal towards the end of 2025. It’s unveiled a moving version of the concept in Paris (in a deep matte blue colour and, frankly, looking like a wheeled UFO) via Instagram, with Barry Keoghan falling out of it. The Type 00 is a decadently proportioned concept and the embodiment of new Jaguar’s unfettered creative freedom. But dial everything down a percentage point or two and it’s also new Jaguar’s first production car, a four-door GT . Two further cars – an SUV and a coupe – will follow. Type 00 will, like the branding that came before, surely polarise, and the team behind it claims it’s happy for the response to not be universally positive. But you have to wonder. Really, new Jaguar’s design aesthetic is fundamental; the wings on which this entire venture will either soar or come crashing down. And when you think about the successful Gerry McGovern (JLR’s chief creative officer) cars of the recent past  – Defender, the LRX concept/original Evoque, the current Range Rover and its immediate predecessor – the naysayers were an inconsequential minority. Well aware that without desirability it has nothing, new Jaguar has given its 800-strong team of designers (working across both Jaguar and Land Rover) the best possible platform for success. Indeed, it claims its new cars (the old ones are no longer on sale, though will obviously remain in the network, kept separate from the new-era metal) are electric primarily as a design enabler. ‘The plan was always electric, for the complete creative freedom that brings, insists MD Rawdon Glover. ‘We needed to break free in order to be able to fulfil the brief; to be a copy of nothing. And for us, even if we think EV won’t be the primary reason for purchase, it gives us incredible speed, refinement and acceleration. We’re really excited about how it’s going to drive – it will drive like classic touring Jaguar.’ Is Type 00 what we were expecting? It is. We knew Jaguar planned to avoid many of the tropes – including amorphous streamlined forms and cab-forward proportions – commonly associated with EVs. And in many ways the car’s ultra-clean surfaces, rejection of fussy details and uninterrupted lines are also a natural extension of the work McGovern and team have been doing for years. Does that diminish the impact of seeing the car for the first time? It does not, though these images – surreal to the point of distraction and far from flattering – do it no favours. Confident and beautifully resolved in places, particularly the shapely tail and pronounced yet sleek rear haunches, it is precisely the kind of statement Jaguar needed to make. Glover describes it as ‘the jaw-dropping future of our original luxury brand,’ and drop jaws it will. There are questions, of course, not least: why the vast bonnet when no engine will ever call it home? ‘That’s like asking someone why they just climbed a mountain: for the exhilaration of it,’ counters McGovern. He also gives some steer as to which elements are likely to survive into production. ‘The proportions are a key aspect of design code. This is not the car as a commodity; it’s not about getting from A to B. It’s a piece of art and exuberant as a coupe, just as the SUV will be exuberant as an SUV.’ How much of Type 00’s impact will be lost in the translation from two-door concept to four-door production car? ‘To answer that I’ll go back to the very start,’ says Glover. ‘Gerry set the team up and it was a competitive process, to try to give this a real sense of edge and ambition. We didn’t want to be conservative, so it was a disruptive process. And once we had our design language, then we then chose a platform for it – design has not been constrained by the platform. With virtually everybody else your platform defines your wheelbase, roof height and lots of other things. We haven’t chosen that route. The challenge to our engineering colleagues was “that’s the way we want the vehicle to look – now let’s build that.” Retaining the design integrity was key, because that’s the most important thing in terms of differentiation and getting that emotional reaction.’ For all the clean-sheet talk, Type 00 inarguably draws inspiration from some decadent eras in car design history, some of them 100 years old. There’s more than an echo of the Bugatti Royale in the statement bonnet; shades of Bentley Speed Six in the silhouette and side window graphic. Flattering references, undoubtedly, and if the production GT can retain the lion’s share of Type 00’s impact then it’ll be a hell of a thing to see on the street. Say what you like about the final product, JLR cannot be accused of not having gone far enough; of failing to grasp the scope of the challenge/opportunity. Unsuccessful though it may have been, old Jaguar’s inertia must have been enormous. Can it work? You don’t have to look far to find the source of its confidence to tear everything up and start over. Its work with Land Rover (Defender, primarily, demand for which shows no sign of decaying, nearly five years after release) and Range Rover (when limited-run £455k special editions sell out in moments, the sky would appear to be the limit) has been astonishingly successful. This year, Land Rover and Range Rover powered H1 profits of £1.1bn, up 25 per cent year-on-year. Q2 2024 was JLR’s eighth profitable quarter on the bounce. The formula? Create uncompromising cars of standout desirability – it really is that simple. Then just stand back and watch the money pour in like Pablo on pay day. Easy. Why not do the same with Jaguar? JLR insists it’s in this for the long haul; that the Jaguar plan is sufficiently robust and far-reaching to survive short-term blips in EV demand. But the plan pre-supposes that its cars are desired. First impressions, infamously, must be got right first time, even – particularly? – when you’re a 90-year-old brand. For this to work the world must fall in love with Type 00. Over to you, world.

353,Toyota’s cute FT-Me concept is a city EV without compromise,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/ft-me/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s ‘new mobility’ department has been busy creating this: the FT-Me. It’s a cutesy and customisable microcar designed for the city – and Toyota intends to productionise it. FT-Me stands for ‘future Toyota mobility experience’ and the aim is to create something for the world’s growing cities, but something simpler and with a smaller footprint. It’s technically a quadricycle, rated to the L6e standard. That puts it in line with cars like and the , Renault Group’s (depending on spec) as well as other quadricycles from the likes of Aixam and Ligier. ‘But I don’t think that terminology does our concept justice,’ says Toyota Europe chief corporate officer, Matt Harrison. ‘We prefer to think about this vehicle as a sophisticated microcar.’ It’s an entirely Toyota-developed product, despite the brand’s tie-up with Stellantis in other sectors of the automotive market. And the way Stijn Peeters, Toyota’s head of new mobility talks about the FT-Me, this is very much a , not if in terms of it making it production. He says that the concept is ‘a great interpretation’ of what the end result will be, and that ‘besides the camera mirrors, I believe we can make it possible.’ Given the FT-Me is designed to fit L6e quadricycle standards, it means those as young as 14 can drive it in certain European markets like France, but Toyota wants the resulting production car to appeal to all. ‘Our cities are rapidly changing into places we’d like to live,’ says Peeters, ‘and we want everyone to be attracted to this car.’ Peeters and Harrison both mention this car potentially becoming a second car for short journeys, for example. The design of the concept shows off the aim to feature as few body panels as possible, reducing costs and making it easier to replace them if they’re damaged. Toyota wants to encourage customisation options, showing us images of different graphics being applied to the FT-Me’s bodywork. A solar roof has also been proposed, designed to add range directly to the car’s battery, and recycled materials have been used in the car’s flexible interior. Speeds would be limited to 45km/h (28mph) given the quadricycle rules, and Toyota is targeting a minimum 62-mile range – more than an Ami or Topolino. But Peeters is keen for the resulting production car to be a little more modern, refined and better equipped than Stellantis’ effort; ‘it’s not just Gen Z that are hyper-connected, we all are,’ he says, holding out his smartphone. The aim, then, is for the FT-Me to have a digital key that resides on someone’s phone, which can be shared to others if needed – and opens up possibilities for fleet use. There’s no official production date yet, but given how far it seems Toyota is in the development of this new mobility concept, we could see a production version in the next couple of years.

354,Toyota kills off ‘bZ’ naming strategy for EVs in Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/toyota/bz-names/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has decided to kill off the strategy of naming its electric cars under a ‘bZ’ codename with all future electric models in Europe – starting with . ‘The C-HR+ marks the start of a new naming strategy in Europe,’ says Andrea Carlucci, Toyota Europe’s vice president and head of product planning. ‘BEVs will be named after existing and familiar Toyota nameplates, and the approach will be expanded as more BEVs become an integral part of Toyota’s line-up.’ For reference, the outgoing nomenclature stood for ‘beyond Zero’, followed by a number to dictate the rough size of the car – with an optional X to dictate an SUV model. The only bZ model that ever launched in Europe is , which will remain named that way given it’s currently already on sale. Other bZ cars are on sale in China, including the bZ3, bZ3X and bZ3C (the C standing for coupe) – as well as the bZ7. Those cars will keep their names. ‘I think it was a very considered discussion,’ says Carlucci, ‘I think we decided to disconnect us from something that is still brand new to something that has been clearly updated. For all new models to come, outside of the 4X, will be named after these existing nameplates – it’s a strategic decision.’ So… why change it in Europe? The name arguably felt confusing and deeply clinical to plenty of customers, and likely didn’t help to create interest in Toyota’s first production BEV for Europe – the bZ4X. Given the model is already on sale, and – the name will remain in place this time around. ‘For me, it would have been even worse to change a nameplate of a vehicle which already exists. We have this proliferation of body types and powertrains, and you have a big number of vehicles to create a whole new line-up for,’ adds Carlucci. ‘We believe that [this new strategy] creates much more familiarity with the cars, and also creates marketing efficiencies.’ While Carlucci points out that the new strategy started with the C-HR+, one could argue that the strategy also includes . The predicted name for that was the bZ2X – but a nameplate that hadn’t been used in Europe since 2008 was used instead.

355,Mixed messaging: Toyota’s C-HR+ is an electric C-HR but also isn’t a C-HR,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/c-hr-plus/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s latest electric car is a C-HR – now with a Plus. The new Toyota C-HR+ is designed to be a proper sibling to the brand’s that, up to now, has only been available as a hybrid. And yet, despite the name that links it so closely to one of Toyota’s most successful models, it’s entirely different underneath. Add to the fact Toyota claims this is ‘an all-new model in its own right.’ Hmm. The name says it’s a C-HR – and is seemingly part of Toyota’s new strategy to drop the ‘bZ’ nonsense of its EVs and give its electric cars ‘more familiar’ names. But everything else says it’s more closely tied to . The design, for example, brings the C-HR+ closer to looking more like a bZ4X Coupe than a C-HR. But its footprint is around 400mm shorter than it, keeping it within the rough C-segment size. Think of it as a rival to the or . The design also makes us come to the conclusion that, disappointingly, this is the production version of . Bummer. Andrea Carlucci, Toyota Europe’s vice president and head of product planning, says the C-HR+ is ‘a very much evolved and matured C-HR,’ when it comes to design. ‘I think, particularly when you look at the C-pillar, there is some strong DNA.’ Inside, it’s also closely linked to the bZ4X in that the overall ambience is quite open and airy compared to the C-HR’s cocooning and cosy cockpit. We had a chance to get up close with the C-HR+ and, more than anything else, we were impressed with the quality of materials used. The seats feature a super soft yet tough-feeling upholstery, and everywhere you touch or were to rest on has a padded texture to it. Toyota claims 416 litres of boot space – around 40 larger than the hybrid C-HR. The infotainment is Toyota and Lexus’ latest screen, with a glossy finish to the 14-inch display itself is fitted with a few welcome physical dials for volume and climate. The drivers’ instruments are set far back – again, like the bZ4X – and Toyota claims a high level of tech as standard. We’ll know more when the car launches later in 2025. The C-HR+ runs on Toyota’s one-size-fits-all e-TNGA global architecture – just like the bZ4X – and Toyota has confirmed two powertrain options for the C-HR+. The 165bhp base model is front-wheel drive and comes with a 57.7kWh battery pack, with a 335bhp upper version launching with a 77kWh battery and all-wheel drive. Toyota is targeting a maximum 373-mile range for the C-HR+ in general; you’ll have to hang on for more detailed range specs. The brand also claims the C-HR+ can be charged at 11kW AC standard, or 22kW AC optional – and up to 150kW via fast DC chargers. Toyota says the C-HR+ will launch in the UK and in European markets from late 2025. We expect the C-HR+ to be priced from around £36k.

356,You can now have a Lexus RZ with a 'manual' and steer-by-wire tech,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lexus/rz/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Lexus has given its a thorough update, introducing some new technology and a fresh, sporty trim in the process. If you’ve forgotten about the RZ (and we wouldn’t be surprised), here’s a refresher. It’s a sharply dressed electric crossover based on Toyota’s e-TNGA platform, and therefore shares a lot in common with the . The RZ naturally remains the sharper, techier and plusher alternative. This version has been significantly overhauled, again mirroring the efforts made to the bZ4X update. Less has changed visually, with the RZ still having that cut-with-a-samurai-sword look about it, and you can still get it with two-tone paint options. Inside, little has changed besides new Ultrasuede materials. It’s what’s underneath that counts, with a larger 77kWh battery that’s designed to be more efficient than before. The RZ350e benefits from 221bhp, while the RZ500e comes with 376bhp. More has changed with the arrival of the new F Sport trim. That benefits from bespoke wheels as well as an angrier body kit and spoiler. F Sport models also launch with a potent new power variant: the RZ550e. The F Sport 550e model comes with 402bhp and all-wheel drive as standard. Yup. After years of trials and tests, Lexus is officially launching its One Motion Grip steer-by-wire system that for the first time. The system removes the physical connection between the wheels and the steering column, and aims to bring greater steering accuracy and sharper angles with less steering effort. Part of that system is the yoke-like steering wheel. Not only a visual differentiator from the regular one, but it’s designed in such a way because you won’t ever need to cross your arms using this system. It’s standard on F Sport, with Lexus Europe head Pascal Ruch confirming that it’ll also be an option on Luxury grade RZ models. The other techy-yet-enthusiast detail is Lexus’ Interactive Manual Drive. This, effectively, is like N Shift on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N; physical paddles on the steering wheel that introduce an element of engagement to driving an EV. When you ‘shift’ the RZ F Sport model, there’s a brief cutting of power designed to simulate a gear shift, and a bespoke engine-like sound is emitted into the cabin. Lexus says the new model will land in the first few months of 2026, complete with the by-wire-equipped F Sport model. We’ll find out prices closer to the car’s launch.

357,New bZ4X: Toyota tries again after ‘bumps in the road’ with EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/bz4x/,Jake Groves,2025-03-11,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s giving its another crack, announcing a significant facelift with fresh technology and overhauled powertrains just three years into the electric SUV’s life. ‘In 2022, the bZ4X was released, and it presented an opportunity only a mature automotive company could offer,’ says Toyota chief branding officer, Simon Humphries. ‘But I think it’s fair to say that we experienced a few bumps in the road during the launch.’ Which, we’d say, is putting it mildly. The car’s awkward looks and middling dynamics didn’t set it aside from a slew of competitors that launched at a similar time, but the biggest clanger was the car’s poor efficiency. Media tests, including CAR’s own EVs vs Winter test in 2022, noted significant differences (even beyond the conventional norm) between claimed WLTP range and real-world figures; with a 100 per cent charge, our front-wheel drive bZ4X on test projected a range of 171 miles, compared with the 277-mile official range. We then drove for 107 miles and refuelled with the bZ4X stating it had 52 miles remaining. Our tested efficiency was 2.53 miles per kWh vs the official figure of 4.4 miles per kWh. The name also arguably alienated potential buyers, given it was so different to everything else Toyota offers. Toyota’s now acknowledged this, for new EVs in Europe – but the bZ4X’s name remains in place, given it’s a model that’s already in production. With this new model, Toyota’s gone back to the drawing board. Humphries quotes kaizen – the philosophy of continuous improvement – in how Toyota’s acted in upgrading its first production EV. The overall design, for example, has been tweaked, bringing the new model closer towards Toyota’s current design ethos and cars like and . The interior has been de-weirded a bit, too, with the high centre console of the old one in favour of a small shelf for phones and a welcome bank of physical switchgear. And, speaking of the C-HR+, the new bZ4X benefits from a similar performance and specification walk-up. Two battery options will be offered here: 57.7kWh and 73.1kWh. The former will be front-wheel drive only, offering 165bhp. Choose the larger battery and you can have a front-wheel drive model with 221bhp or an all-wheel drive version with 338bhp. While unconfirmed, Toyota is targeting a max WLTP range of 356 miles. The new bZ4X will go on sale towards the autumn of 2025, with more detailed prices and specs for the UK market coming later.

358,All new engines from Toyota will be GR-flavoured,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/toyota-gr-engines/,Jake Groves,2025-03-12,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has confirmed that its performance division is developing a new series of engines. As well as motorsport and performance car purposes, Bart Eelen, head of TGR and motorsports, has confirmed to CAR that these engines will also make their way into conventional Toyotas, too. That means an engine designed, developed and engineered by Gazoo Racing, could end up in a next-generation or – just as much as a WRC car or GR performance vehicle. ‘We’re in the process of developing a brand-new family of four-cylinder combustion engines with both 1.5 and 2.0-litre capacities,’ says Matt Harrison, chief corporate officer for Toyota Europe. ‘These engines will feature new technologies and new thinking. For instance, they will have a shorter piston stroke that allows them to be much more compact. That allows us more freedom for our designers and engineers when it comes to packaging.’ ‘New ICE engines are pretty rare these days, but we really wanted to do this,’ says Eelen. ‘The block is super compact, and the centre of gravity is super low – and the engine combines both efficiency and performance.’ These engines are designed to run on conventional petroleum and, given GR’s pursuit of performance, reports suggest power outputs reaching 400 metric horsepower. The engines, however, can also be combined with e-motors to create both full and plug-in hybrids. They are also being developed to run on hydrogen combustion fuel, as part of Toyota’s ongoing development of that fuel type. The current mule for engine development is , where the M stands for ‘midship.’ The model has brought on a bunch of speculation as to whether Toyota will build a new MR2 or Celica, to which Harrison smirks and says ‘we’ll have to wait and see about that.’ The prototype engine, codenamed G20E, will be competing in a Super Taikyu race in 2025 as part of its engineering and development program. It’s an interesting perspective. Usually in the car world, the engine development process is the other way round; the main company develops the engine for the performance arm to then upgrade. That must mean a lot of pressure. ‘It goes back to Toyota’s idea of using motorsport as a test bed and as a way to develop new things,’ says Eelen. ‘I think that’s something that Akio [Toyoda, former head of Toyota] introduced into the company. Toyota hadn’t thought that way before.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

359,Citigone: why Skoda is not planning a Czech version of the VW ID.1 electric city car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/skoda/skoda-rejects-version-of-vw-id-1-electric-city-car/,Tim Pollard,2025-03-13,Car Magazine UK,"The boss of Skoda has ruled out a Czech version of Volkswagen’s upcoming ID.1 electric city car, saying that the company will instead extend the lifecycle of its existing smaller, cheaper combustion cars to appeal to customers who are not yet sure about plugging in. It’s the latest sign that car makers are hedging their bets on how quickly motorists are wanting to adopt battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and dashes hopes of a new VW Up/Skoda Citigo/Seat Mii trio of small, affordable runabouts. Klaus Zellmer, CEO of Skoda Auto, told CAR magazine: ‘Our colleagues from VW have just introduced the . We have decided not to be part of that segment. We believe within the Volkswagen Group that VW will conquer that part of the market. At the same time we decided to extend the lifecycle of Fabia, Scala and Kamiq until the end of this decade. ‘The Fabia starts below €20,000 (£17,000) and we will introduce a mild hybrid version of it, which is especially important for Italy. We are confident that as a core brand group we have the right strategy to offer choice to our customers.’ Skoda may not be plunging into the mainstream small electric car segment just yet, but it is intending to leverage the Volkswagen MEB Small architecture, the platform underpinning the group’s most compact electric cars, for its new Epiq compact crossover EV (below). The circa-£22k will be introduced in 2026 and Zellmer predicted that it would quickly become the company’s biggest selling EV. ‘Epiq has to be the biggest sales volume in our battery electric vehicle segment. Market segments are like pyramids. The top of the pyramid is the most expensive, the bottom is the least expensive. The shape that you get is the volume potential. The further down you go the price ladder, the more potential you have in the pyramid and that’s why the Epiq has to by definition outsell Elroq and Enyaq.’ Zellmer was speaking as Skoda announced its annual results today, posting record turnover of €27.8 billion (£23.3bn) in 2024 – its highest sales revenue in history. That generated an operating profit of €2.3bn (£1.9bn), giving a margin of 8.3%, not to be sniffed at in the volume sector. These are interesting figures, since the total sales volume of cars stood at 926,000, up 7% on the previous year – but still trailing significantly the 1.25 million sales posted in 2018. It proves that Skoda’s strategy of moving upmarket, selling fewer cars but at higher prices is bearing fruit. Which might just explain why the logic of not launching a spiritual successor to the Citigo in electric guise might just be the right commercial decision.

360,A funeral for a friend: Maserati builds its last-ever V8-powered car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/maserati/v8-axed/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-08-06,Car Magazine UK,"Today is a sad day for Italian car fans. Maserati has finally called time on its V8-powered models. That means the company now has one less powertrain to worry about as it chases down its ambitious goal to become an . In the short term, Maserati’s fastest models will feature either its 3.0-litre Nettuno V6 engine or electric motors and battery packs. But, by the end of next year, the brand aims to have an EV alterative for every model in its range – a strategy the firm is already executing with the Folgore versions of the and . Granted, Maserati has made this job a little easier by thinning out its line-up. The brand hacked the Ghibli saloon from its range last year, and it’s now swung the axe on the and . That just leaves the , the new and the in Maserati’s range, all of which – rather conveniently – are already available as EVs. To mark the death of both the Quattroporte and its V8 engine, Maserati built a one-off Quattroporte V8 for a customer in the United States (pictured). Its twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre V8 engine was also used in the and – and it chucks a whopping 564bhp at the saloon’s rear wheels. In a typical display of Italian theatrics, Maserati called it the ‘Quattroporte Grand Finale’ – and the brand gave it some unique design touches to mark its significance. So, there’s a unique ‘Grand Finale’ badge on its centre console, one-off ‘Grand Finale’ treadplates and a custom engine cover signed by the engineers who worked on the project. Plus, the car’s body kit is made from carbon fibre – and its boot has been trimmed in leather. Like a Gucci handbag. More electric cars. Maserati has already hinted it’ll launch an electric replacement for the Quattroporte, but that isn’t expected to arrive until 2028 at the earliest. The brand has also confirmed it’ll launch an ‘E-UV BEV around five metres in length’ in 2027. It’ll be an electric SUV to sit above the Grecale and replace the Levante. Both these new cars will ride on , which means they’ll have maximum ranges of more than 500 miles and 0–62mph times as low as two seconds.

361,"Musk's masterplan: how the Model 2, new EVs, appstores and other services will revolutionise Tesla strategy",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tesla/tesla-business-plan-how-a-cheaper-ev-could-supercharge-elon-musk-s-ev-plan/,Ben Oliver,2024-07-01,Car Magazine UK,"Whatever the is called and whenever it finally arrives, there’s a chance it might finally turn its maker into the last thing Elon Musk thought it would become: a mass-scale global car manufacturer on a par with General Motors or Hyundai at six or seven million cars per year, or more. Not that Tesla is exactly a minnow now. Its current share price may be half what it was at its peak but it is still more than double that of its nearest rival, Toyota, which makes more than 10 million cars each year. Tesla has just been overtaken by as the world’s largest EV maker, but the 1.85 million cars it made in 2023 is still an increase of 35 per cent on the year before: growth the legacy car makers can only dream of. That gap between share price and scale shows the markets think there’s much more growth to come. They always have. Like other hot tech stocks, Tesla’s seemingly insane valuation has been uncorrelated to its present performance, however strong. The growth of its share price and its sales is despite its spasmodic development as a car maker, and the controversies that swirl around a founder who is about the last person you’d put in charge of what is now a large-scale industrial enterprise. But the launch of the Model 2 (above), or whatever Elon chooses to call it, may be the moment when that gap starts to close: when the various strands of Tesla’s business, which have developed so unevenly until now, finally start to align, just as the global geopolitical picture shifts decisively in its favour too. When CAR first started talking to Musk back in the late Noughties he had no desire to build cars at scale and to quality, which he knew was a near-impossible task from a standing start. Instead he was sure that an established car maker would buy him out. But pretty soon they couldn’t afford him, and before the end of this decade Tesla might be exactly the kind of whale he once thought would swallow his minnow. There are four strands to the Tesla story in the Model 2 era, the first of which is product. Despite its scale, Tesla still doesn’t have a rational model range, or conventional product cycles in which these models get replaced every four or five years. Instead it still sells the – now a beyond-pensionable 12 years old, and which already looked a bit like a lot of other cars when it launched – alongside the (below), easily the maddest-looking vehicle from a mainstream car maker. ‘When Tesla finally makes a palatable three-row SUV and a pick-up that looks like a Model 3,’ investor and analyst Reilly Brennan wrote recently, ‘it is possible that it will be a company on the scale of VW or Toyota.’ The Model 2 alone plainly won’t plug all the holes in Tesla’s random range. But at around $25,000 it is exactly the EV that buyers want right now. Rivals from VW to BYD agree, and are either planning or already selling their own, but Tesla’s more affordable EV is likely to be more appealing for its intrinsic qualities. It’s bound to be quick, with a decent range, and have the same brilliantly reductive design as the Model 3, with an advance order book even longer than that new Tesla generated by the time it finally went on sale. Tesla’s brand image is based on being smart, not expensive, so a cheaper model will benefit from that rather than dilute it. The next strand is production. Once, trying to ramp up his first factory to the volumes his customers wanted and the quality they expected was the bane of Musk’s otherwise gilded life. ‘Building cars is hard,’ he admitted, while the established car makers rolled their eyes and reminded him that it had taken some of them a century to learn how to build a Golf or a C-Class or a Leaf that well. But now it looks like Tesla may be giving the lessons. Its quality is still way behind that of its established rivals, but it is building cars at margins that make those rivals weep. While Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is warning of a ‘bloodbath’ among the legacy car makers if they try to sell $25,000 electric cars without paying close attention to their costs, Tesla has been slashing the prices of its cars and still making huge profits. Model 2 (our artist’s impression, below) will go further, with a radically simplified production technique that will reduce manufacturing costs and ought to improve quality too. Tesla says it will make 40 million Model 2s over its life: all of them at a fat margin. Or will it? The third strand of this story is all the stuff that has been distracting Tesla from building a coherent model range, but which may finally start to make sense – and money – as its scale starts to go supernova: the Supercharger network, Full Self-Driving (FSD), over-the-air software updates, its energy generation and storage products, the sale of regulatory emissions credits, and income from leasing and insurance. Tesla had revenues of nearly $100bn in 2023, of which $14bn came from its energy products and other services, with income from FSD and other software included in its $82bn of automotive revenues. Terrifyingly for its rivals, Musk has said that once Tesla acquires sufficient scale he could sell his cars for cost and make all of his profit from this other stuff. Will he? Probably not entirely: future profits are likely to be a balance of both. But Model 2 will give Tesla the huge additional volumes its other stuff requires to make serious money very quickly. Musk has already shown a willingness to slash prices and margins to maintain growth in a way that the established car makers can’t match; and when lower prices mean more users and data and non-car revenue, he’ll be tempted to slash more. He says that a Tesla app store would make sense with around 10 million of its cars on the road, a number it’ll hit within two years. An official API (application programming interface) has just been released allowing third parties to develop apps for Tesla vehicles, and soon the ecosystem the company is creating around its cars will be as much of an attraction to buyers as it is a source of profit. The last big theme here is beyond Tesla’s control but plays straight into its hands. Governments around the world see the huge importance of EV and battery manufacturing to their future economic security. They also see that those supply chains are still nascent and pliable and can be influenced. Spooked by the disruptions caused by Covid, the war in Ukraine and the threat of conflict in Taiwan, the US in particular is busy throwing grants and incentives at manufacturers and consumers alike to build and buy more American-made EVs, with battery components and minerals sourced in the US or from friendly and reliable nations. The EU can’t match the scale of the Biden administration’s spending on this, but both are considering higher tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to counteract the colossal subsidies that the Chinese state is pumping into its car makers to counteract slumping domestic demand and open up export markets with unanswerably cheap cars. Tesla will be affected by this: the US Inflation Reduction Act cut the $7500 federal grants from the base and long-range variants of the Model 3, for example, because too much of the value of their batteries is still sourced from ‘foreign entities of concern’. But others were hit harder, and with gigafactories in the US, Europe and China already making Model 3 and capable of building Model 2, Tesla is uniquely placed to navigate and even benefit from the reshoring, unwinding of globalisation and even trade wars that are set to dominate global economics generally and the electric car market specifically over its new model’s lifespan. So how big will Tesla get with the Model 2, and whatever else it adds in the meantime? Will it go from nearly two million cars each year to Ford’s scale at four million, or GM’s at six million, or Toyota’s at 10 million? If it’s making those cars more profitably than any of its rivals and making more money still on software and services, it probably doesn’t matter – other than to the ego of its founder, assuming he hasn’t imploded by then.

362,Ding-ding! The next new BYD is an all-electric double-decker bus for London,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/byd/bd11-electric-bus/,CJ Hubbard,2024-05-24,Car Magazine UK,"That sense of BYD as some kind of unstoppable force in the market just got another hit, as the Chinese firm has now whipped the – very large – covers off a new red double-decker bus. Making its global debut at the London Bus Museum, the BYD BD11 will start picking up passengers ‘shortly’. Designed specifically for London – with ‘provincial versions’ to follow – the BD11 is intended to take full advantage of BYD’s energy-dense . Built to be as safe as possible, the Blade Battery also offers very fast charging and up to 532kWh of capacity. This is not that new. The (at Brooklands) was chosen for the launch location in part because it houses the first electric bus with a BYD K9E chassis that was used in London, but there are already around 1000 battery-electric models operating in the capital. The plan is for the entire London bus fleet to be zero emissions by 2030. Currently it’s a mix of diesel hybrid, BEV and hydrogen fuel cells. Oh shush. As if that massive battery wasn’t reassuring enough – that 532kWh maximum size is apparently market-leading – the BD11 has some serious charging tricks as well. With dual-gun and pantograph fast charging it can accept up to 500kW. Enough power to enable 0-100 per cent in just two hours, making even a passenger car as impressively fast charging as the seem lethargic. BYD hasn’t released any range estimates, but we’re guessing all that means it ought to have enough. AS is typical of BYD’s Blade approach, the battery is fully integrated into the chassis. This is said to increase driving range as well as improve stability, manoeuvrability and passenger space. Thermal management is similarly incorporated at a fundamental level. BYD says it’s the only firm in the world that makes all its own EV powertrain components – with the motors, control units and automotive semiconductors as well as the batteries all developed in-house. Which ought to help with efficiency, too. In addition to that, the BD11 gets active suspension and a suite of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

363,Stepping up a weight category: next-generation Vauxhall Grandland EV launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/vauxhall/grandland/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"Vauxhall is forging ahead with its tree-hugging, eco-friendly vehicle strategy. The firm has just launched a reborn (and heavy electrified) version of the – and it’s following that up with an all-new version of the Vauxhall Grandland . Naturally, the all-new 2024 is similarly electrified. Vauxhall plans to sell it with a choice of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure-electric powertrains – and it’ll become one of the first cars in the Stellantis group to ride on the new . It follows in the footsteps of the third-generation . The parts sharing between the two cars means Vauxhall can take advantage of Stellantis’s latest battery technology, which will give the electric Grandland a maximum range of 435 miles. Vauxhall says it pulled inspiration from its when it was sketching the new Grandland – so it looks a lot more striking than the old car. It also gets the next generation of Vauxhall’s Pixel LED headlights, an all-new infotainment set-up and a cleverer approach to storage than the previous model. These are all important for family duty. The Grandland is wading into a crowded market, so it needs to do something different to stand out. Key rivals include the , and . Scroll down to find out how Vauxhall will tackle the competition. Well, it’s bigger for a start. The new Grandland is 173mm longer than before, which has helped to liberate an extra 20mm of legroom for those in the back. The car is also 19mm taller and 64mm wider, so head and shoulder room should noticeably improve. Vauxhall has also given the Grandland a bit more storage space. Its seats-up boot capacity has swelled from 514 litres to 550 litres – and there are more than 35 litres of storage bins dotted around the car’s cabin, including smartphone pockets in the front seat backrests, a massive centre console and Vauxhall’s brand-new Pixel Box. What’s that, we hear you ask? It’s a storage bin that’s been specially designed to hold a smartphone. It has a built-in wireless charger and a glass lid that Vauxhall says will ensure you never forget your device when you get out of the car. Neat idea, but a tenner says it doesn’t work. Never underestimate the power of human forgetfulness… It’s also worth mentioning that, while the Grandland’s seats-up boot capacity has increased, its maximum boot capacity has fallen ever so slightly from 1652 to 1641 litres. And, although Vauxhall hasn’t confirmed it yet, we expect the figures we’ve quoted thus far are for the most basic hybrid model. The PHEV will probably have less boot space to accommodate its battery pack and electrical gubbins. There are three options available: a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and an EV. The hybrid powertrain mixes a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a 28bhp 48-volt electric motor and six-speed automatic gearbox. Vauxhall hasn’t yet confirmed efficiency figures for the Grandland hybrid, but we expect it’ll be similarly economical to the latest . The Citroen is available with the same hybrid system and can return around 50mpg in the real world. Not bad. Note also how Vauxhall is cashing in on the newly relaxed rules meaning that badges and, ahem, insignia can now be illuminated for the full jazz-hands nighttime look (see below). Mobile billboard, anyone? There’s also a plug-in hybrid and an EV. However, Vauxhall is being frustratingly light on detail for both these powertrains. For now, all we know is that the PHEV has a maximum electric range of 53 miles, while the EV is powered by a 98kWh battery that serves up a maximum range of 435 miles. Vauxhall has been a little more open about the Grandland’s chassis technology, though. The SUV will be available with frequency selective damping, which the firm claims can be softened off to help filter out cobblestone vibrations or tightened up to better control the car’s body when you’re driving hard. Plenty. We’ll start with the Grandland’s interior and its new 16-inch infotainment system. It’s thin, wide and mounted high up on the dashboard to help minimise driver distraction – and it’s been teamed with a new digital gauge cluster and head-up display. Thankfully, Vauxhall hasn’t fallen into the trap of shifting all the Grandland’s switchgear onto the touchscreen. Like the Astra, it retains a row of physical climate controls on the centre console. Plus, if you find all the data from the two screens rather overwhelming, Vauxhall has added a ‘Pure’ mode that pares back the info to just the essentials. Obviously, there’s loads of safety equipment, too. Standard kit includes adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition and post-crash braking, which will lock the brakes in place to help to prevent a secondary accident if you have had a shunt. And even though the new Grandland is larger than the model it replaces, that extra bulk should be relatively easy to wrangle around town. There’s a roster of technology to assist you when parking, such as front and rear parking sensors, a rear-view camera (with a self-cleaning function, don’t you know) and a 360-degree parking monitor. In addition, Vauxhall has given the Grandland the latest version of its Matrix LED headlights. They’re called Intelli-Lux Matrix LED HD – and the units have 51,200 (!) elements between them. Vauxhall claims this allows them to cut out oncoming vehicles with even sharper definition to help . Soon. Vauxhall plans to put the Grandland on sale in July 2024. The company also says that the first cars will reach customers by the time autumn rolls around. Vauxhall hasn’t yet confirmed UK prices and specs for the Grandland but, to be competitive with the likes of the Qashqai and Sportage, the firm will need to target a starting price of between £28,000 and £30,000.

364,Adrian Hallmark leaves Bentley CEO position for Aston Martin,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/aston-martin/adrian-hallmark/,Jake Groves,2024-03-22,Car Magazine UK,"Adrian Hallmark has announced his departure from Bentley, and is joining Aston Martin as its new CEO. After an initial announcement on his departure from the company at Crewe, Aston Martin has confirmed his hiring succeeding Amadeo Felisa. ‘I’d like to personally pay tribute to Amedeo, recognising not just what he has achieved at Aston Martin but throughout his long and distinguished career at the very top of the ultra-luxury automotive industry,’ says Aston Martin executive chairman, Lawrence Stroll. ‘In Adrian Hallmark, we are attracting one of the highest calibre leaders not just in our segment, but in the entire global automotive industry. Complementing our world-class leadership, Adrian will bring to Aston Martin unrivalled experience in both the ultra-luxury and British manufacturing sectors to progress our strategy and continue recent momentum,’ adds Stroll. Hallmark had been chairman and CEO of Bentley since 2018 until March 2024, tackling massive industrial headaches like the Covid pandemic and semiconductor shortages. On top of that, Hallmark has spearheaded a massive investment into electrification and its ‘Beyond100’ plan, setting Bentley up for the future. This comes after a long prior relationship with Bentley. Hallmark originally worked at Bentley from 1999 and 2005 as board member for sales and marketing, helping to redefine the brand as it launched its Continental GT. Adrian Hallmark says in a Bentley statement: ‘Bentley has had a great influence on me. To redefine luxury mobility for the future with such a strong brand is a task that I took on with full commitment and great pleasure. The time has now come for me to turn to new challenges. I would like to express warm thanks to the entire Bentley team for all that we have achieved together in the last few years.’ Gernot Döllner, chairman of the Audi board and leader of the ‘Progressive Brand Group’ within VW Group (which includes Bentley, Lamborghini and Ducati), says ‘Adrian Hallmark has achieved a great deal at Bentley. In his six years as chairman and CEO, he has made his mark on Bentley Motors, and along with his team in Crewe has successfully pushed ahead the development of the company.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

365,Genesis Magma: new high-performance arm kicks off with hot GV60 concept,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/magma/,Jake Groves,2024-03-26,Car Magazine UK,"Genesis has officially confirmed that it will develop and engineer more high-performance versions of its cars via its new Magma program. Its first, bespoke designed Magma model is a high-performance concept of its . CAR , confirming that Genesis was investigating the feasibility of offering high-performance models in its future range of vehicles direct from the source at the brand’s Seoul HQ. The brand has now confirmed that it intends to create a Magma performance edition for each of its models in the range – everything from the GV60 to the G80 and GV80. And it looks like Genesis has been doing quite a bit to slowly warm us up to the idea of a hot Genesis. First, there was the concept, which launched at the 2023 New York motor show in its eye-catching ‘Magma’ orange colour. Then, at the Gran Turismo World finals in December 2023, the brand unveiled the – an extreme concept car that’s designed for use within the Gran Turismo video game. Elsewhere, the Middle East arm of Genesis unveiled a Performance model painted in Magma and coming complete with an aggressive bodykit. Now, it seems, with the reveal of the new GV60 Magma concept, the brand has decided to officially tie these four cars together into this new high-performance brand. The GV60 Magma concept is the first car to wear that new Magma name with pride. As well as ‘enhanced performance’ and ‘ample power’ – CAR understands that figure to be more than the ‘s 641bhp – the GV60 Magma concept features a slammed ride height, an extreme bodykit with air ducts for brake cooling and more downforce and aerodynamically-designed 21-inch grey wheels. Genesis chief creative officer, Luc Donckerwolke, says that the brand will ‘continue to reveal experimental concepts with careful consideration of both technological and aesthetic elements. While speed and performance are important, the Genesis Magma program will look beyond.’ The four cars of the new Magma arm will be on show at the 2024 New York International Auto Show, as well as .

366,Genesis’ new Neolun concept is a boxy but dramatic future vision,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/neolun/,Jake Groves,2024-03-26,Car Magazine UK,"Genesis has revealed a new concept car called Neolun. This boxy, yet oddly clean-looking SUV concept is likely designed to hint at a future GV90 flagship joining its range in the near future. The Neolun name is derived from ‘neo,’ Greek for ‘new,’ and ‘luna’ – the Latin word for moon. Smash the two together and, rather obviously, Neolun stands for ‘new moon.’ Genesis says the concept car ‘embodies the ultimate Genesis hospitality’ from behind the wheel. And it’s certainly an impactful thing to look at. It still has a two-box SUV-like shape, but it’s almost as if every one of the Neolun’s edges have been exposed to a belt sander for far too long. The brand’s double-deck lighting signature features, and this more modern take on it echoes the brand’s Speedium concepts. Massive alloys that almost ape Mercedes’ monobloc design feature, and the Neolun comes with coach doors for easy accessibility – very Rolls-Royce. Inside, the Neolun includes massive armchair-like seats front and rear, with the front ones having the ability of swivelling around. As well as the deep purple upholstery, which Genesis says has been achieved using only natural pigments, the flooring is all made of natural wood. As well as a sound system similar to the ‘s massively clever (trust us, we’ve tested it) Bang & Olufsen system that makes you feel like you’re in the middle of a concert hall, Genesis says the Neolun includes a radiant heating system. As well as being more energy efficient than conventional HVAC technology, Genesis says the tech has links to Korea’s ‘ondol’ method of heating homes. While some of the Neolun’s features look a little elaborate, the concept very likely previews an all-new production model for the brand: a GV90. Given Genesis’ ambitions to be taken properly seriously as a luxury brand, rivalling the likes of the and will likely be the brand’s next serious move.

367,More than meets the eye: Updated 2024 Mercedes G-Class revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/g-class/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2024-03-26,Car Magazine UK,"What might look like a particularly lazy facelift of the Mercedes G-Class is in fact a series of substantial upgrades. These are claimed to improve performance, efficiency and the G’s abilities both on and off-road. As the big seller is the Mercedes-AMG G 63, this gets even more tweaks than the regular G-Class. This includes an optional new suspension system that brings active roll control for the first time. To find out more, we headed to the home of the G-Class in Graz, Austria. Look closely and you’ll spot new bumpers front and rear, new aero-optimised wheel designs and the striking new blue seen at the top of the page. However, it’s the details that make all the difference. For the first time you can have keyless entry on those vault-like doors, and there are even more cameras than before. These include one mounted low up front so you can see everything the long bonnet usually hides. Not only is it good for squeezing through tight gaps in Chelsea, it also means you can pick the ideal off-road line more easily. Crucially, the breeze block aerodynamics have been improved whilst keeping the G-Class looking like a G-Class. There’s a new spoiler that sits above the windscreen and the A-pillar cladding has been smoothed out, helping efficiency and the plentiful wind noise current Gs suffer from. There are also vents in the front wheelarches to further promote airflow, although the G-Class’s economy still isn’t exactly brilliant. The G 450d is best at 32.5mpg, with the G 500 at 25.9mpg and G 63 a ruinous 19.2mpg. They figures might not look that impressive, but they’re a useful improvement on the old car. Not out of the G 63’s motor, although the integrated starter-generator now fitted to all G engines adds 20bhp and a useful shot of torque. If you must have your G-Class with a V8, this is now the only option as the G 500 (or G 550 in some markets) gets a six-cylinder instead. With both exhaust and electrically-driven turbochargers, this 3.0-litre inline six produces 443bhp and 413Ib ft of torque, enough for a quick 5.4 seconds 0-62mph time. That’s significantly up on the G 450d, although 362bhp, 553Ib ft and 5.8 seconds is plenty. This car’s predecessor wasn’t slow in a straight line, but its cornering prowess and comfort fell behind independently sprung rivals. To help, all G-Classes now come with adaptive dampers as standard, while the G63 has optional suspension with active roll control. We’re not going to pass judgement until we’ve driven it, but it should at least go around a bend more briskly than before. It retains the coil springs, independent front suspension and live rear, but adds hydraulic actuators that are interlinked. As with the , pitch and roll can be controlled without big, bulky anti-roll bars. There’s another upshot for the G-Class as this improves axle articulation off-road, meaning the G63 could be the most capable model, at least for the moment. Having seen a couple of videos of the system in action, it can keep the body uncannily level whether you’re cornering hard or hammering down a rough dirt track. While the dash architecture looks familiar, MBUX has replaced the old infotainment system whilst keeping the screens the same size. Graphics, response time and connectivity has been improved, and you still get a good spread of physical controls for stuff like the heating. There’s a new off-road control panel that groups a few key features around some refreshed diff lock switches above the heater toggles. Not only can you lock centre, rear and front diffs, you can also select manual gears, low range and the off-road cockpit from this area. Sadly, you also get the fiddly touch-sensitive Mercedes steering wheel, but that was an inevitability. Not many people buy off-the-peg G-Classes, so the range of personalisation options has been increased further.

Stringent new agreed by the EU and United Nations have brought an earlier end to the 718 duo than was anticipated. Most models are on run-out on the Continent and being removed from sale in mainland Europe by 1 July 2024, although a quirk of legislation means that high-performance derivatives are unaffected. The and are not affected, as they fall under small-series type approval. Porsche Great Britain has confirmed to CAR magazine that it will still be selling every which flavour of 718 for the foreseeable future, as will most markets outside the EU. ‘We will continue to sell all 718 Boxster and Cayman models in the UK, as long as they are built by the factory’ a spokesman told us. ‘We sell a few thousand in the UK each year.’ Even though the 718 range sells in relatively low numbers (it’s the lowest-volume Porsche model line globally), it has an important role to anchor Porsche as a sports brand. Stuttgart’s mid-engined model series have represented the lowest rung on the sports car ladder for nearly three decades and have proved a hit with critics and customers alike. News of the 718’s European demise was quietly announced late in 2023, but its sales status in the UK is now assured – at least so long as demand in the rest of the world warrants continued production. Sales of the duo actually rose in 2023 by +13%, to 20,518 – less than half the 911’s 50,146 volume worldwide. Europe has adopted new global regulations agreeing common security standards in the automotive Cyber Security Management System (CSMS), which is designed to keep cars safe and unhackable. The digital architecture of the Porsche 718 twins is around a decade old and Stuttgart cannot justify upgrading its innards so late in the car’s life.

369,Maserati’s 724bhp MCXtrema finally hits the track,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/maserati/mcxtrema/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-03-26,Car Magazine UK,"Maserati’s MCXtrema has begun testing at its natural home: the race track. Its thorough testing program kicked off last month in Parma around the Autodromo Varano de’ Melegari, with the first few laps turned in by Maserati’s chief test driver Andrea Bertolini. Testing represents the next chapter in the MCXtrema’s quick development cycle, and one of the last before all 62 examples are delivered to customers in late summer 2024. Physical testing is the finishing touch; before Maserati’s track toy even hit the tarmac, engineers had already put it through around 200 hours of dynamic simulation and over 1000 hours of virtual analysis. Now that data will be compared with the on-track feedback. ‘For months, we worked together with a team of highly skilled and passionate people, waiting for the moment we could bring the finished object to its natural habitat, after putting it through its virtual paces in sophisticated simulations,’ said Bertolini. ‘With MCXtrema, we have raised the bar of development even further, working with the track in sight and always bearing in mind the needs of the Maserati customer, who remains the focus of our work and to whom this car is dedicated. For more on the MCXtrema, keep reading. Visually, you can just about figure that it’s based on the road car, but the revised carbonfibre bodywork no longer has to comply with any kind of type approval and the designers have gone to town maximising the aero. That substantial splitter and sharky nose seem to emphasis the raised wheel arch wells even further at the front, while a set of what appears to be wind-channelling over-fenders add attitude to the rear – even before you clock the central shark fin, adjustable spoiler and vented engine compartment over the monster diffuser. Weirdly, in spite of all that modernity it reminds us of earlier supercar excess somehow, shades of 365/512 BB Ferrari and later De Tomaso Panteras. Maserati, of course, would rather we were put in mind of the MC12, the last time the firm let itself so utterly off the leash. Just wait until you see the interior… Maserati puts it this way: ‘A car dedicated to the excellence of gentleman drivers and racing cars’ enthusiasts, designed to impress and to ignite passion for extreme racing, ready to conquer the tracks around the world – in private test sessions – with its fine design and mind-blowing performance.’ In case that’s not clear, the MCXtrema is the latest example of a homologation-dodging track toy based on an existing road car. Going this route means no worrying about regulations governing road or racing cars, and also the opportunity to charge an absolute fortune for the privilege of high performance and exclusivity. Maserati claims it’s ‘unleashing a true racing beast, something different and disruptive compared with anything that has ever been done before.’ Publishing that ahead of the final reveal, we thought someone in the press team might have had a few too many espressos. But while the MCXtrema doesn’t seem quite as wild as the AMR Pro – placing a greater emphasis on the gentleman driver element in the process, perhaps – there are certainly plenty of pieces here that genuinely get our pulse racing. And in a world where supercar track slayers seem to come out of the mould every few minutes, that’s saying something. Much of this you would probably expect, but we’re still drawn in by the details. The MCXtrema uses an upgraded version of the MC20’s 621bhp Nettune V6 engine – a new pair of turbos helping it reach 724bhp and 538lb ft. A dry-sump oil system will help keep things lubricated on track, and the horses hit the road at the rear wheels via a six-speed sequential gearbox and mechanical limited-slip differential. The bespoke race exhaust system maintains a catalytic converter – we aren’t dealing with hooligans here, after all – and you get race-grade carbonfibre brakes. The ‘ultra-light’ central carbonfibre monocoque is reinforced by an FIA-spec safety cage, there’s an FIA-spec fuel tank and air jacks. Yes, air jacks, because you’re definitely going to want to have the right tyres on at the right time, here. Less obvious aerodynamic features include the flat underbody, while the revised double-wishbone suspension geometry is supported by adjustable front and rear anti-roll bars and four-way adjustable racing shock absorbers. Springs can be adapted to suit, too. The wheels are 18-inch centre-lock items. The adjustability continues with the Maserati Corse traction control, the electric power-steering system, the brake bias and the ‘engine strategies’ – all of which can be refined by the driver on the fly. Maserati hasn’t quite hit its targeted dry weight of 1250kg, instead saying the MCXtrema weighs approximately 1300kg before fluids. But that’s still around 557bhp per tonne. Cockpit is the right word, as the view from the driver’s seat makes it look as if Maserati has dropped the MCXtrema on top of a single-seater racing car. Instead of a conventional dashboard and steering wheel, the person at the controls is faced with a F1-style yoke with large integrated display screen – taking care of the instrumentation. The MC20 dashboard itself has been stripped out, exposing a purpose built crossbeam in its stead. Maserati likens this to the exposed structure of the . Well, why not. Either side of the driver is a panel of additional controls to allow for all that extra finite adjustment referred to previously. This creates the single-seater-like space, which may not be generously proportioned but is well-padded to prevent damage to knees and elbows from the g-forces. The panel on the door side can be moved to make it possible to actually get in and out. As this hints, the MCXtrema is intended to be a single-seater itself, but a passenger seat can be added as an option. Standard features, however, include the bucket seat, FIA-compliant six-point racing seat belt, the roll cage and… air-conditioning. Telemetry, pit-lane limiter system, pit radio and rear-view camera all come as part of the package as well. Nope. Maserati is making just 62 of them, and they’re all already sold. Still, at least it’s good to look at. What a way to tackle a track day. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

370,These limited edition WRC-inspired GR Yaris models will cost £60k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/ogier-rovanpera-gr-yaris/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-03-27,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has revealed pricing for the – as well as the new special editions you can read about below. The base car will now kick off at £44,250 but the two special editions described here will now kick off at £60,000 each. You can see the full price list below: Two limited-edition versions of the new, already sought-after . Called the Ogier Edition and the Rovanperä Edition, both cars were revealed at this year’s Monte Carlo rally, and named after two of the Toyota WRC’s teams most decorated drivers. Chairman Akio Toyoda said that both cars were commissioned to ‘express my respect and gratitude to the drivers who hone and grow our cars in rallies, to all the teams that provide us with such opportunities, and to rally organizers and all others involved, as well as to fans.’ If you want one, you’ll need to be quick – and live in Japan; they’re a domestic model only, and Toyota is currently planning to make just 100 of each. GR engineers have left the engine untouched, so power remains at 276bhp and torque at 288lb ft, just as in the standard car. However, the manner and means in which that power is delivered to the road is very different: instead of a gravel and track mode, each model now has a special set of modes derived from the input of each driver – as well as Toyoda. The Ogier edition features a Morizo mode (named after Toyoda’s driving pseudonym) and a Seb mode, which delivers rear-wheel bias for a more oversteery, but quicker car. The Rovanperä version features a donut mode, and Kalle mode, which reduces rear traction on entry and increases power to the front axle on exit – effectively dragging the car out of corners. As with the Ogier model, it’s this latter mode that delivers the lap times. Both cars also feature a normal mode, as on the High performance, RZ trim. In addition to the powertrain tweaks, both cars also get a few more superficial upgrades. Both editions get new rear spoilers – with the Ogier edition getting a lightweight rally spoiler, and the Rovanperá getting the same CFRP spoiler as the GRMN Yaris. Colours are different too, with the Ogier getting a new matte Stealth Gray colour and the Rovanperä edition is getting three-tone paint. There’s also a sprinkling of WRC badges around the car, and both steering wheels get stitching to match each drivers’ nationality. Each car will also come with access to the drivers, cars and teams at the 2024 Rally of Japan – as well other gifts and the chance for owners to have their name displayed on the 2024 rally car.

371,How the EU is blocking Japanese sports cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/jdm-sports-cars-vs-the-eu/,Jake Groves,2024-03-27,Car Magazine UK,"We are living in a new halcyon era of the Japanese sports car. Toyota has the petrolhead by the scruff of the neck with its and in Europe, as well as the GR Corolla in North America. Honda’s new Civic Type R is the instant classic we all hoped it would be. Hell, even Nissan has resurrected the Z car. But for the European and UK enthusiast this surge of immensely tasty metal from the other side of the world comes at a significant cost. Safety and emissions regulations, combined with some huge price rises, are restricting sales so much that they could end up being seen on the road about as often as unicorns. Few cars illustrate this point more than the heavily-updated Toyota GR Yaris that’s just gone on sale in the UK in March 2024, as well as . With the Yaris, some will notice the astronomical price rise between the original car and the base-spec facelift; we noted a £33,495 price tag during for a top-end Circuit Pack model with all of the goodies needed to get the best out of the car. Now? – albeit that model does come with a lot of the tech from the pre-facelift Circuit Pack (and even more power) included. The new model already feels a fundamentally better car , but that’s still a huge cost addition. It’s the same with the Honda. When the previous-generation FK8 launched it cost around £31k. Now, Honda’s asking for a mighty £49,995 in 2024. And where Honda UK would shift thousands of Civic Type Rs per year just a couple of generations ago, its 2023 allocation was in the hundreds. Why? Fleet CO2 limits. Exceeding those means utterly enormous fines, even if you miss that target by a tiny amount. At the beginning of 2021, for missing the target fleet CO2 average by just 0.5g/km. It’s the reason why the likes of Honda have re-worked the economics around its tearaway Civic Type R. If it’s forced to shrink volume, why not crank up the price, in turn paying for more high-performance engineering, and reward the hardcore enthusiast with a truly special car? The same logic applies to that new-generation GR Yaris; sell fewer cars with fatter margins so the brand still makes money, but doesn’t fall quite so foul of fleet CO2 averages. New Euro 7 emissions regulations have blindsided the automotive industry, adding significant financial and time costs as manufacturers – already flat-out racing to electrify – have to rework powertrains. ‘If a car is in production and regulation changes, normally you’d get a two-year grace period,’ a senior European engineer tells CAR. ‘But with Euro 7, it doesn’t look like that’s happening.’ And the legislation will require car makers to make some profound engineering changes to keep cars in production. ‘Euro 7 covers emissions, tyres and brakes. For brakes, do we have to change the size of the discs? The brake’s system performance? Is it a full change? Then what does that mean for stopping distances?’ All models must either be adapted in double-quick time or face early retirement. And new models naturally need to comply; not straightforward considering the short lead time for implementing Euro 7. And that’s not all. The latest General Safety Regulation (or GSR2) kicked in from July 2022, and although the UK is no longer in the EU, it still applies in the UK. It specifies that new cars need intelligent speed assistance, some sort of reversing aid, driver attention warnings and additional cybersecurity measures. All things that will add cost, making a big difference on more affordable cars. Cars already in the line-up have an additional two years to comply; if the manufacturer wants that model to remain on sale, it must find a way of adding those features. ‘Every new registration needs a speed limiter, cameras have to be a higher spec and accurate to around 90 per cent across the whole of Europe,’ says our engineer. ‘There even needs to be a [docking station] for an alcohol breathalyser.’ GSR2 is the reason the GR86 has such a small sales window, for example. According to our sources, fitting the new camera needed for the speed and lane-keeping tech would involve redesigning the roof and windscreen – a prohibitively expensive refit for a low-volume sports car. That’s a move Toyota’s not prepared to make, meaning the GR86 will go off sale in 2024 in the UK and EU, before it falls foul of the new rules. So, if you’re one of the few who succeeds in getting the keys to one of these endangered species, count your blessings and drive it. The rest of us will look on with envy but, perhaps, with fatter wallets. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

372,"The 2024 Toyota GR Yaris will cost £44,250",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/gr-yaris/,Tim Pollard,2024-03-27,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has revealed pricing for the new MY2024 GR Yaris and it won’t make pleasant reading for prospective owners: the new hot hatch will kick off at £44,250 on the road, around £15k more than the original cost back in 2020. The price will jump further if you go for an automatic transmission, and will rise to £60,000 if you want one of . Why the price hike? Well in addition to inflation and rising manufacturing costs, the position of the new Yaris has changed. It’s now super limited, and comes during a time when car brands are trying to get their average CO2 figures down too. The full pricing is below: There’s more power, for starters. The diminutive 1.6-litre three-cylinder engine has popped down the gym, with more boost, strengthened valvegear and lightweight pistons to increase power to 276bhp and torque to a chunky 288lb ft. That’s a significant step up from the original GR’s 257bhp and 265lb ft, and should ensure improvements to performance, although European speed claims are not yet released. We’ve already driven a prototype and you can read our here. Toyota says the new hot hatch will arrive in Europe in summer 2024. ‘The UK allocation of the all-new GR Yaris will be limited,’ warns the Toyota UK website. ‘Further details on the allocation process will be available from March 2024.’ The GR Yaris is the brand’s first all-wheel drive sports car since the Celica GT-Four, and was mostly developed in Finland with Tommi Mäkinen Racing in the run-up to the Covid pandemic. One of the big changes for 2024 is the adoption of an eight-speed automatic gearbox – yes, a torque converter, not a twin-clutch affair. The Gazoo Racing Direct Automatic Transmission will be an option, meaning buyers still buy a six-speed manual, if they’d prefer DIY gears. Toyota says the eight ratios in the auto ‘box are closer-stacked for more ferocious acceleration and the transmission is geared for especially fast changes; the vehicle’s ECU logic predicts which cog will be required next to pre-select the correct ratio during deceleration. It’s tap-forwards for downchange, pull-back for upchanges, at chairman Akio Toyoda’s insistence. There is a new drive mode selector offering Normal, Sport and Eco settings, tailoring power steering, air-con, throttle response and transmission shift speed on the DCT gearbox. The Toyota GR Yaris has proved popular with enthusiasts, selling 18,000 in Europe since launch in 2020. However, few owners would rave about the functional, brittle interior – which is why Toyota has upgraded it for 2024. The new interior (below) has an instrument pack lowered by 50mm to improve the driver’s field of vision, the driver’s seat is mounted 25mm lower and there is a new 12.3in digital screen. The GR Yaris gains the Toyota Safety Sense systems, sat-nav and a digital key. Picking the DCT auto brings a JBL stereo, forged alloy wheels and parking sensors. There is one new colour – Precious Metal – in addition to Emotional Red, Precious Black and Super White/Platinum White Pearlescent. The core paint options are based on the palette of the Toyota Gazoo Racing livery. The original 2020 GR Yaris was capable of a 0-62mph sprint in just 5.5 seconds and a top speed limited to 143mph. We expect those figures to improve substantially and will update this story once the 2024 model is homologated. Theoretically, the all-wheel drive system allows for power to be shifted 100 per cent to either the front or rear wheels. However, the set modes in the car are Normal (60 per cent front), Sport (30 per cent front) and Track (50 per cent front) with the latter implying that Track is designed both for tarmac and loose rally-type surfaces. The GR Yaris is a bit of a Frankenstein’s monster, as it uses the front half of Toyota’s GA-B platform (first seen on the new Yaris hatch) and the rear half of the GA-C platform (found on cars like the Corolla and C-HR). That combination allows for a MacPherson strut front/double wishbone rear suspension set-up. Grooved 356mm brakes with four-piston calipers are standard. For 2024 the chassis has been strengthened with 13% more spot welds and 24% more structural adhesive, spring rates are revised and the shock absorber mounting assemblies are toughened. The Circuit model – the only version to be offered in the UK – adds an additional radiator, intercooler spray and modified air intake. Look out for two special editions of the new 2024 Toyota GR Yaris: The Sébastien Ogier Special Edition and Kalle Rovanperä Special Edition will be unveiled at the Monte Carlo Rally, taking place from 25-28 January 2024.

373,New Ford Explorer: it’s been around the world and it’s found its specs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/explorer-ev/,Phil McNamara,2024-03-27,Car Magazine UK,"Ford’s Explorer electric SUV will cost £39,785 and go on UK sale in August 2024 – about nine months behind schedule. But the Blue Oval has used the delay to good effect, updating the battery tech to boost DC charging and range – the bigger battery variant can cover up to 374 miles, which Ford reckons is class-leading for now. It also spent the past six months driving prototypes around the world, with travel influencer Lexie ‘Limitless’ Alford at the wheel. The Explorer is the first electric car to achieve that feat, visiting some of the world’s key antipodal points and racking up the miles in Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia and South and North America. The ‘Charge around the Globe’ odyssey covered 30,302.6km (18,830 miles) and ended in Nice, south of France, as Lexie crossed the finish line in her Explorer, flanked by a cavalcade of historic European Fords. Read on for all the spec details. Ford talks about its ‘can do’ attitude, but it would have been a ‘can’t do’ without Volkswagen – the Explorer is an beneath the skin, though overhauled by Ford’s hardware, design and software experts. The midsize is the first fruit of the firms’ 2019 tech alliance, and the Explorer is a bit smaller than the ID.4: a similarly sized rival is the . By using Volkswagen’s MEB electric car platform, Ford reckons it cut the development time by two years. Before it added another nine months on again, ostensibly to get VW’s latest Nickel Manganese Cobalt battery tech that meets Europe’s latest sustainability standards. Extended range Explorers, costing from £45,875, pack a 77kWh liquid-cooled battery pack for the rear-drive version, while the all-wheel drive version gets 79kWh (usable capacities). A 55kWh pack (gross capacity) will power the standard range car, although Ford is yet to confirm this model’s exact specs. There are three electric motor options, with either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive in the flagship version. Here’s how the specs break down: • Usable battery: 52kWh • Motor: 125kW (168bhp), rear-wheel drive • Range: 218 miles range (to be confirmed) • Price: £39,875 • On UK sale: late 2024 • Usable battery: 77kWh • Motor: 210kW (282bhp), rear-wheel drive • Range and efficiency (Explorer spec): 374 miles, 4.47 miles per kWh • Range and efficiency (Premium spec): 355 miles, 4.23 miles per kWh • Price (Explorer spec): £45,875 • On UK sale: available to order now, deliveries August/September • Usable battery 79kWh • Motor: 250kW (335bhp), four-wheel drive • Range and efficiency (Explorer spec): 329 miles, 3.96 miles per kWh • Range and efficiency (Premium spec):  305 miles, 3.74 miles per kWh The 250kW flagship Explorer splits its power across both axles, with an asynchronous motor added up front to supply torque during hard driving or on slippery surfaces. In true American spirit, Ford quotes a 1200kg towing capability for this model, or 1000kg for the 210kW 77kWh model. The most efficient rear-drive car can cover up to 4.47 miles per kWh, while the AWD equivalent is just under 4 miles per kWh. The Explorer can charge from a 7kW AC home wallbox (or 11kW if you have three-phase electricity), and comes with two capacities for DC ultrarapid charging. The 77kWh battery’s fastest DC charging is pegged at 135kW, while the 79kWh pack can take up to 185kW of fast-charge juice. Both those charging rates are higher than Ford’s initial expectations. Replenishing the two batteries takes a similar time, going from 10 to 80 per cent in 26 minutes for the 185kW DC capable all-wheel drive car, and 28 minutes to charge the rwd Explorer’s slightly smaller battery. A heat pump, useful for managing cabin climate without draining the battery, will be optional. Ford has also confirmed the Explorer’s acceleration times, and it’s fractionally quicker than comparable ID.4s (which are bigger). The rear-wheel drive Explorer sprints from standstill to 62mph in 6.4secs, with all-wheel drive cutting that to just 5.3secs. No word yet on the capabilities of the base Ford, but the entry-level, £40,145 ID.4 has a 125kW motor and accelerates from zero to 62mph in 9.0sec. And can the VW-with-a-new-top-hat drive like a Ford? ‘The springs, dampers and anti-roll bar are all tuned to the Ford philosophy,’ promises engineering manager Thomas Riehm. ‘There’s been a lot of adaptation: the steering and brakes are tailored to the Fordness people are used to.’ The car also gets bespoke Continental tyres. This summer’s test drive will reveal if Ford can soup up MEB’s solid but hardly enthralling dynamics. Lexie Limitless is quite the explorer, having visited the world’s 196 sovereign territories by the age of 22. This expedition was in an capable of up to 374 miles for the rear-wheel drive Extended range version. With the six-month (on and off) trip required over 250 charges in total, refuelling on everything from ultrarapid DC chargers to domestic sockets. In areas without charging infrastructure, filling the 77kWh battery using a 1.5-2.5kW mobile wallbox could demand stops exceeding 24 hours. Long stints across Chile’s barren Atacama desert proved particularly tense, while periodic grid shutdowns challenged the crew in South Africa and Zimbabwe. ‘Lexie’s journey has been the ultimate test drive for our new Ford Explorer, taking on every kind of weather and road condition, and dealing with just about every charging scenario,’ said Martin Sander, general manager Ford Model e Europe. ‘It embodies the true ‘can do’ spirit of this company.’ Using the Explorer name reflects Ford’s change of strategy. Out go the and Focus European hatchbacks, in come electric models which trade on Ford’s American roots to make them stand out. So when the project kicked off in mid-2020, the design team knew they were creating an Explorer. That’s why the car is a distinctly two-box SUV, with ramrod straight lines. Its looks trade any hint of sportiness for strength. The roof is quite horizontal unlike the sloping Volkswagen’s, and the pillars are blacked out to give it a ‘floating’ roof effect, like the big Explorer. The pillar just behind the rear door has the same ‘sail’ shape as its US cousin’s, but here it’s peppered with translucent silvery grey. The Explorer is a little lower and 12cm shorter than the ID.4: overall, the Ford measures 4.46m long, the reduction coming from a shorter rear overhang. That reduces luggage space by 93 litres, to 450 in total. The Ford and VW are much the same width and share the same wheelbase, because their battery packs are identical: boosting differentiation would suck up big investment. So while the batteries, motors, suspension and key dimensions are shared, Ford has designed a unique ‘top hat’ for the MEB platform. The proportions and glasshouse betray the VW underpinnings, even though Ford says it’s pushed back the windscreen. ‘The Explorer has fantastic proportions,’ says Jordan Demkiw (above right) who led the exterior design team and showed CAR around the vehicle in advance of its world debut in March 2023. ‘The wheels have a large overall diameter, there are short overhangs, a relatively long hood and a [slightly] rear-positioned cabin. There’s a good glass to body relationship, it’s a car that sits well on its wheels.’ Alloys span 19 to 21 inches. A big leap of faith was eliminating current Fords’ trapezoidal grille. ‘We were dwelling on this forever,’ confides Murat Güler, chief designer passenger vehicles. ‘With electric cars, you can take that [engine breathing] element away, but you still want to give the car a strong personality. Some EVs look a bit characterless, like jellybeans!’ Interior quality and aesthetics take a massive step forward compared with recent Ford’s bleak and cheap cabins. ‘They weren’t because our colour and material designers weren’t as creative as others,’ says Murat Güler. ‘Ford has put money into the suspension and other places which consumers can’t see, but enthusiasts feel. That’s maybe one of the reasons we couldn’t go as bold as the French or others.’ The pictured car is an Explorer Premium, but the two-tone dashboard is standard across the range. The lighter grey lower section lifts the ambience, and the horizontal sections – including the discrete vent strip – continue the exterior design theme. There’s no leather option: seats are either part or wholly upholstered in sporty, manmade Sensico. There are a few parts shared with VW, including the twist-action gear selector (though dropped from adjoining the driver’s display to the steering column), and the fiddly pair of window switches where you have a ‘shift’ key to toggle between front and rear operation. The main events are the massive touchscreen and voluminous stowage. The 15-inch screen is mounted in portrait configuration, and gives max real estate for its nav map and widgets. Ford reckons its display is the biggest around, which should make it easy to jab on the move. There aren’t physical air-con controls, but the sliders can be permanently displayed at the screen’s base. Ford’s big innovation is that you can swing the screen through 30 degrees, to find your favourite angle. Push it all the way back to reveal a locker, where you can stash wallet or keys. It’s mechanical for a quick, simple user experience. Beneath the armrest lies a MegaConsole (in Ford marketing speak), which can store a laptop or three 1.5-litre drinks bottles: just remove the adjacent cupholders to widen the opening, or if they get in your way. And the cavernous cubby can be segmented with a divider which doubles up as an ice scraper (a nice, Skoda-style touch). All good. But the pulse hardly races when stowage is a car’s biggest USP. Ford says it’s investing $50billion (£41bn) in electrification in the next four years. As a result, half of its global sales will be pure electric by 2030, the point when all its European passenger car should be strictly zero emissions. Ford has struggled for profitability on this continent for years, though it’s resisted the General Motors option of pulling out of Europe altogether. But that’s why Ford, with its far smaller scale than mega-car groups such as Volkswagen or Stellantis, has been forced to do a short-term EV technology deal. A second model, expected to be a coupe version of the Explorer similar to the ID.5’s relationship to the ID.4, will follow in 2024. There’s no crime in platform sharing, otherwise all car company CEOs would be behind bars. But the car world feels a poorer place when Ford, which has engineered Europe’s dynamic benchmarks with the Fiesta and Focus hatches, is buying in VW’s MEB electric architecture to underpin its new EVs. It’s the reversal of 25 years ago, when VW had to headhunt Ford engineers to catch up with the Mk1 Focus’s control blade rear suspension. ‘The Fiesta and Focus are making way for a new Ford strategy in Europe,’ counters a Ford spokesperson. ‘We’re not going to be the same company that people grew up with, going after volume and playing in every single segment. We’re going to double down on differentiated vehicles that get your pulse racing more.’ So does the Explorer get your pulse racing? Or is it an expedient car lacking true Ford authenticity, or an alluring ownership proposition that grafts a distinctive Ford body onto well-established Volkswagen engineering? Let us know in the comments below. How you – and buyers – respond will be fascinating to watch…"
387,New Ford Focus ST Edition is ready for the 'Ring,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/ford/ford-focus-st-edition/,Graham King,2024-04-11,Car Magazine UK,"This is the new Ford Focus ST Edition, which Ford describes as its ‘most complete hot hatch ever.’ Featuring adjustable suspension and bigger brakes, it has been honed for on-track performance at the Nurburgring’s fearsome Nordschleife. The suspension, supplied by KW Automotive, is 10mm lower than standard at the front and rear of the car in its default setting, and can be wound down by another 20mm for track driving. In addition, there are 12 settings for jounce – upward damper movement – and 16 settings for rebound – the speed with which the damper returns to position. The suspension settings have been calibrated specifically for the Focus ST Edition by Ford Performance’s engineers. If owners aren’t sure exactly how to set up the suspension, the car comes with a document detailing the recommend settings for ‘a variety of driving conditions – including specific settings for the Nordschleife.’ The front brakes have also been upgraded with 363mm Brembo discs, which Ford claims provide ‘powerful and consistent braking, lap after lap. The 19-inch alloy wheels are made using a process called flow forming that retains the material’s strength and increases shock resistance. Yet they save 10% in unsprung mass at each corner. The wheels wear track-ready Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. Mechanically, the Focus ST Edition is unchanged, though that’s no real hardship. It’s powered by a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine turning out 276bhp, which gets the car from 0-62mph in 5.7 seconds before topping out at 155mph. It comes with a six-speed manual gearbox – no optional automatic here –  a limited-slip differential and is only available in hatchback form. The fetching shade of Azura Blue pictured here is the only colour option; there’s a smattering of gloss black detailing to the outside and Motion Blue stitching inside. You also get the Driver Assist Pack with its adaptive cruise control and lane centreing system; the Winter Pack, which includes a heating steering wheel and windscreen; and a 675-watt Bang & Olufsen stereo. A similar ‘Edition’ package was made available on the pre-facelift Focus ST about a year before it was replaced by this latest version. The new ST Edition starts the countdown to the Focus’s ultimate demise in 2025, when production stops to make way for Ford’s upcoming electric cars. It’s quite the time of change at the Blue Oval in Europe. The Ford Focus ST Edition costs £42,905 – £5200 more than a standard ST – and order books opened in April 2024.

374,Last orders for Volvo oil-burners: Swedes build their final diesel car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/last-volvo-diesel-engine-2024/,Tim Pollard,2024-03-28,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo has formally stopped building diesel engines altogether and the last off the line was an SUV built at the Torslanda plant in Sweden in late March 2024. It’s a sign of the times, as the fuel plummets to record lows in the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2016 and the sudden switch to electrification gripping the industry. Volvo has been quick to pivot and the end of diesel production is hardly a surprise; it confirmed its abandonment at Climate Week in New York in September 2023. The Swedes have been quick to embrace electrification, gradually adding mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid tech to its range for the past five years – before rolling out fully battery electric vehicles (BEVs) such as the EX30 and EX90. As recently as 2019, the majority of Volvos sold in Europe refuelled at the black pump, but a deliberate industrial strategy accelerated electrification. In Volvo’s case, this backed petrol-electric hybrids over derv models as a stepping stone to fully . It’s a move that’s working: in 2023 70% of all Volvos sold in Europe had electrified powertrains (globally the figure stood at 34%). The end of diesel Volvos brings to an end a 45-year history. Volvo launched its first oil-burner in 1979 with the 244 GL D6 – the world’s first six-cylinder diesel engine in a passenger car.

375,"McLaren’s future design: keep it clean, mean and seen – even on an SUV or electric car",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mclaren/future-design/,Jake Groves,2024-03-28,Car Magazine UK,"McLaren Automotive has outlined its design strategy of the future – led by its new chief design officer, Tobias Sühlmann. Well, we say ‘new.’ Think of it as arguably maintaining the course set by and beyond, but reducing down the complexity to some key principles that will be on every future car McLaren makes. And, according to Sühlmann, that will extend to cars that will be electrified or electric, and may perhaps feature ‘more than two seats’ – yet another hint about . ‘We need to do the next steps now,’ says Sühlmann (pictured above), ‘and we need to move the brand forward. There will be a bigger portfolio, possibly, and we need to look into different power technologies. Is there more than two seats? Yeah, possibly.  And we need to develop a form language that separates each model from each other – that is quite important.’ So, regardless of powertrain or body style, McLaren says all its future cars will essentially have three continuing cues that are focal to the brand. Those elements are the dual elements on the front end (like the vents on McLaren’s Can-Am cars, or the ‘eye sockets’ on a ); a ‘Performance Line’ that runs along the beltline of the car and swoops over the wheel arches; and an open rear end for air flow – something quite clearly seen on the F1, as well as every modern McLaren since. Include those three key elements and, according to Mclaren and Sühlmann, you can craft whatever you like and it’ll still be a recognisable model for the brand. ‘You need this signature to establish the opposite. Completely separate products to individualise their different purposes,’ Sühlmann tells CAR. McLaren’s design team also want to design more details into its cars that are designed to thrill, while also having a purpose. Steve Crijns, senior design manager at McLaren Automotive, says visibility is key to a driver feeling comfortable driving such potent sports car and points out ’s in-built lower windows set into the doors: ‘visibility doesn’t just help you drive better, it can also make the experience more exciting. That window [in the Senna] is something we asked for.’ The brand believes that building these key pillars will make distinct and exciting models going forward, including whenever it decides to venture into segments that aren’t normally McLaren’s patch. ‘I guess, for us, it’s the fundament. If you don’t do your homework, the house built on top will shake and crack and fall into itself,’ says Sühlmann.

376,"Ubiquity ahoy: Tesla sells its 200,000th car in the UK",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/tesla/2024-uk-sales/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-03-28,Car Magazine UK,"British buyers can’t seem to get enough of Tesla. At the end of March 2024, the brand announced it had sold its 200,000 electric car in the UK. To put that figure into context, the UK only saw its in February 2024. That means, currently, one fifth of all EVs on our roads are Teslas. Tesla reckons its success can be partially attributed to its rather unconventional sales strategy. The company operates a direct-to-consumer model, which means buyers don’t need to visit a dealership to purchase their . They can just thumb around on the brand’s website and have the car delivered directly to their home. You can get one quite quickly, too. Over the past year, Tesla has streamlined its production and logistics operations to slash delivery times down to just 30 days. The firm used to deliver its cars in quarterly chunks, which meant buyers could sometimes wait as long as three months to receive their car, so this is a massive improvement. Tesla’s UK sales and delivery manager, Michael Oates, said: ‘Reaching this milestone of 200,000 deliveries shows how far Tesla has contributed to the UK’s transition to sustainable energy. More and more customers are not just looking towards Tesla as an option for sustainability, but also for safety and affordability.’ Well, Tesla is still quite keen to make its cars more accessible. In the past, the company did this with a notoriously volatile pricing strategy. For example, the Model 3 and Model Y received a , as the brand fought to keep itself at the top of the EV sales charts in the face of its newer competitors. But Tesla tells us it has now stabilised its new car prices. Instead, it’ll seek to make its cars more attainable to those on tighter budgets with its expanded approved used programme. In a nutshell, Tesla plans to build up a stock of well-maintained cars and sell them back to public through a series of certified used car hubs. Tesla’s making strides in that area, too. Its goal is to make owning a Tesla as stress-free as possible – and its Supercharger network plays a big role in that experience. The firm has installed 1,400 Superchargers at 140 locations up and down the UK. It also has plans to further expand its network over the coming year with the roll out of its . Tesla’s V4 Superchargers can deliver up to 250kW of DC power, which is enough to blast the s battery from zero to 80 percent charge in just half an hour. That’s just enough time for a comfort break, which means it’s relatively easy to cover long distances in the company’s EVs. Plus, all the latest Superchargers support the Plug and Charge protocol, which means you don’t need to faff about with payment cards or apps to use them. You simply link your car to your bank, plug into the charger and the payment is automatically taken from at the end of the charging session. The Supercharger network is staggeringly reliable, too. We think it’s the on the market – and Tesla’s stats back up our experience because, during 2023, the company claims it managed to retain 99% network reliability. Currently, the only way you can access the network is by owning a Tesla. So, if you want an easy EV experience, that’s reason enough to opt for one of the company’s cars. Tesla is also improving its maintenance practices. Like its sales and delivery programme, the company has a direct-to-consumer strategy – and it claims that it can fix 50 percent of its cars using mobile servicing. That means buyers can organise maintenance from the comfort of their own homes.

377,"The CAR Inquisition: Dr. Markus Heyn, Bosch Mobility",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/markus-heyn-bosch/,Jake Groves,2024-04-02,Car Magazine UK,"If you drive a car, chances are it uses at least one component from Bosch. The company is a giant in the automotive world, developing everything from fuel injectors and spark plugs to sensors, brake components, batteries and even wiper blades – and much more besides. But the automotive landscape is changing, and so is Bosch. After its involvement with , for which it was heavily fined, the German company says it ‘has taken further steps to considerably improve its already existing compliance policies and procedures.’ Bosch says it is now ‘looking ahead, focusing our attention and resources on shaping the future in our areas of business.’ As that future will involve fewer engines and more EVs, the company is becoming increasingly involved in software and digital technologies. The person at the epicentre of Bosch’s automotive transformation is Dr Markus Heyn, chairman of Bosch’s Mobility division, and a member of Bosch’s management board. He’s lived and breathed cars since his university days at the tech-centric RWTH Aachen, including a stint as a researcher at Ford before joining Bosch in 1999. ‘The acceleration of certain trends, and the impact that these trends have on our offerings, led us to the conclusion that we needed to really focus on them,’ says Heyn. ‘It’s a huge change – so much so that it will affect almost all of the 250,000 people here at Bosch, but we’re making good progress.’ Bosch’s exhibits at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and the 2023 IAA Mobility show in Munich gave an insight into its current priorities: lidar sensors, software for connected mobility and interior comfort technologies. Heyn prizes Bosch’s reputation as a company that creates reliable components that can do the job, and assures us it will still be the case in the digital universe. ‘We’re a brand that is trusted and a brand that can deliver high quality,’ he says. ‘Every year we win awards for our products. The good news is that our heritage brings tremendous safety and security which, for automotive, is absolutely important. It’s different here than it is making smartphones, for example. And while our heritage has always been mechatronic systems with software embedded in it, we’re now building more of a pure software business.’ The size and diversity of the company in some ways helps Bosch to pivot quickly and commit to its new strategy wholeheartedly: ‘We have 38,000 software specialists and developers – that’s massive! Even if you go beyond all of the automotive players, it’s a tremendous workforce that will help us to catch up to the train of digitisation,’ says Heyn. As well as developing and refining proprietary software and componentry, Bosch is aiming to become a bigger player in semiconductors – a component rapidly growing in importance in the modern car. ‘On average, the electronic content of a vehicle is about 10 per cent higher year on year, so even if the magnitude of produced cars would stagnate, the electronic content would still rise significantly.’ Heyn points out that Bosch has had skin in the semiconductor game for years but admits some potential was untapped. ‘We primarily focused on making them for divisions inside the company, but we’ve opened it up to the external market.’ And now it’s pouring billions of euros into that part of its business. It opened a chip factory in Dresden in 2021, and last year acquired US-based TSI Semiconductors and opened a chip testing facility in Malaysia. ‘We really need to focus on this critical technology in order to prevent a second wave where the automotive industry could be strangled again [like it had been initially post-pandemic] because there simply isn’t enough capacity. The hard part is that growing electronic content of a car – we need to now focus on that core technology to avoid any more deadlocks in the future.’ ‘A Golf, a blue one – I had a little help from my parents to buy it. I was very happy with that car.’ ‘Having the guts to rebuild this company with new perspectives on hardware, software and semiconductors. I think it’s a bold move considering we’re such a big company.’ ‘I used to race around on small back roads on private land with friends when I was much younger. I regularly used to drive my mother’s car, which was green but usually came back brown after I was finished with it. She didn’t know about it for a long time!’ ‘My first winter testing in Sweden. I learned you couldn’t beat physics, and landed an AMG GT in the snow and couldn’t get it back out.’ ‘Supercar, mainly because I attend two or three motorsport events a year and see so many.’ ‘It was the magneto ignition cylinder!’ [Heyn is correct.] Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

378,Hyundai and Kia’s new robot can carry 16 coffees around an office at once,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/hyundai-kia-dal-e-robot/,Ted Welford,2024-04-03,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai and Kia have shown off their latest new robot that will be able to bring you coffee in the office and deliver parcels in shopping centres. Known as the ‘DAL-e Delivery’, it’s the latest version of the firms’ robot, and could take off from where Honda’s now-closed left off. Think of it as a facelift, but probably more interesting than an i30 having a mid-life update. This latest robot is faster and features new facial recognition that guarantees the right Deliveroo is delivered to the right person. It’s got a hint of Wall-E, hasn’t it? Hyundai and first showed off their delivery robot back in December 2022 and it’s now back with a makeover. It’s had a redesign so that the centre of gravity is at the bottom and means it’s less likely to fall over. The South Korean firm says the new metal-like design gives it a ‘sleek, premium aesthetic’. A premium robot, who knew! It can travel at 1.2 metres per second – slightly less than the average person and it’s fully autonomous with its ‘enhanced suspension’ said to provide a ‘steady ride over bumps’. You wouldn’t want to spill those coffees, after all. Despite being smaller in terms of overall dimensions, its internal cargo space is larger. There’s room for 16 cups of coffee and items weighing up to 16kg. Four modules make up the DAL-e’s technicals, combining a motor with steering, suspension, braking systems and ‘environmental recognition’ sensors so it doesn’t bump into walls or trip people over. The modules, in combination with the sensors, ensure it can be used in busy environments. Hyundai says it works across multiple floors in a building and work with lifts and automatic doors. Once the robot arrives at its destination, facial recognition technology can identify the recipient through its camera, before the door opens automatically and allows the person to pick up whatever items have been purchased. If you’re thinking this is all a bit dystopian, you’re right to an extent. Hyundai and Kia says it’s designed to work in modern office buildings, restaurants and shopping centres It’s already teamed up with South Korea’s largest property investment firm IGIS Management Company to develop ‘robot-friendly buildings’. Not surprisingly, its first outing is at that company’s new smart office building in Seoul, with the robots set to be buzzing around it once it opens later this month.

379,Renault’s refreshed Captur gets a Scenic face graft,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/captur/,Jake Groves,2024-04-04,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has given its small Captur crossover a facelift for 2024, introducing some newer technology and a face that looks awfully like the larger . That fresh look includes a revised front end, as well as some new wheel designs and colours. LEDs are standard across the range, and Renault says they have welcome animations now. Fresh wheel designs feature, and you can spec two-tone paint options as you could with the pre-facelift. The interior has had a gentle refresh, too, including some new upholstery types made from recycled fabrics and a new Esprit Alpine (think BMW M Sport or Audi S line) trim. The infotainment has been upgraded to Renault’s Android-based Open-R system, which is the same one used in cars like the . Two powertrains will be available – a 1.0-litre TCe 90 petrol engine and an E-Tech Hybrid model. The standard petrol has 89bhp and is paired with a six-speed manual, while the brand’s 1.6-litre E-Tech hybrid model (also seen on the and ) has 143bhp and claims up to 60.1mpg.

380,Theon Design’s GBR003 is a restomod 964 Targa,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/theon-design-gbr003/,Jake Groves,2024-04-04,Car Magazine UK,"Theon Design has unveiled its third UK commission – a restored and improved 964-generation 911 Targa. The base 964 Carrera 2 Targa was stripped back to its bare components and has beeon gone over with a fine-toothed comb by Theon Design, with the brand’s client then adding on their own restoration spec. What’s resulted is a carbon-bodied Targa finished in pastel blue to the client’s own sample named GBR003. Theon Design has gone full retro here, including deep dish, 18-inch Fuchs wheels shod in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tyres beneath the blistered wheelarches, and black and white houndstooth upholstery inside. Under the carbon bodywork is more carbonfibre; Theon has crafted some new carbonfibre bracing to strengthen the chassis. Despite the additional bracing, the GBR003 weighs 1228kg. As for the powertrain, the GBR003 uses a 4.0-litre, air-cooled and naturally aspirated flat-six that develops 403bhp and 320lb ft, with all of that shove being sent through a six-speed manual transmission. Theon says that the GBR003 has the same power-to-weight ratio as a 991-generation GT3, and the engine is allowed to shriek via the team’s own exhaust system, which is ceramic coated, also includes a manual toggle inside that can further open the valves. Brakes from a 993 RS are fitted, too. Inside, besides the houndstooth upholstery, the cockpit has been kept as period correct as possible. But Theon has included small, more modern details like an audio system from Focal and a place to hold a phone. ‘Everyone who’s driven the Targa during our exhaustive development process has been bowled over by the results; it delivers the rigidity and handling precision of a coupe, but with the added sensory rush of a convertible,’ says Theon co-founder, Adam Hawley. ‘It’s driving in technicolour: you’re totally engaged by the analogue driving experience and more aware of your surroundings too. Of course, you also get to hear much more of the addictive flat-six howl! As a team, we’re exceptionally proud of the results, and the customer is delighted, too.’ Want one yourself? Theon says that, aside from 18 months of your patience and a donor car, it’ll set you back a minimum of £390,000 for a coupe, or £415,000 for a Targa.

381,Facelifted Hyundai Tucson goes on sale from from £32k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/tucson/,Tom Wiltshire,2024-04-04,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has revealed the mid-life facelift for its popular Tucson SUV. This new model has a mildly updated exterior and redesigned dashboard and centre console, and is available to order now. For this update, Hyundai has softened the front end of the car slightly, replacing the sharp-edged daytime running lights with new more rounded models. The grille has a wider appearance, while the headlights remain underneath the DRLs. A full-width skidplate-style silver element adds greater visual width. It’s perhaps testament to just how futuristic the Tucson looked at launch in 2020 that it still looks ahead of the times even with such a mild facelift. The car’s intricately surfaced flanks and squared-off wheelarches remain, and they’re filled with new alloy wheels. Inside, Hyundai’s redesigned the dashboard with a single piece of glass covering both infotainment and driver information screens – the old car had these in separate binnacles. The air vents now occupy a full-width strip of the dashboard, and are set lower than before. There’s also a new climate control panel sitting above a redesigned centre console, prominently incorporating a wireless charging pad. The new steering wheel eschews the Hyundai ‘H’ badge in favour of the small horizontal strip found on its Kona model – there’s also redesigned switchgear. The gear selector has also moved to the steering column, again echoing the Kona. The new dash certainly doesn’t appear to have any room for a manual transmission shifter – it’s possible Hyundai may do the same as Kia does with the base-spec Sportage and offer a radically different centre console for models with a manual gearbox. Despite dwindling manual transmission sales, Hyundai will also continue to sell a six-speed manual ‘box at the entry point in its range, mated to a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol. Every other model is either mild, full or plug-in hybrid and has a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Prices start at £32,000 for an entry level Advance model with that aforementioned 1.6-litre manual model. If you want a mild hybrid, prices start from £34,000, a conventional hybrid starts from £35,640 and a plug-in hybrid version costs from £39,275."
382,New Skoda Kodiaq starts from £37k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/kodiaq/,Jake Groves,2024-04-08,Car Magazine UK,"has revealed pricing for its new second-generation Kodiaq, which arrives this summer with a £36,645 starting price. A lot is riding on the shoulders of this with the Czech firm recently selling its three millionth SUV – a Kodiaq, obviously – and needs to keep that momentum up. So much so that this new generation promises to be roomier, plusher and more technologically advanced than before, without losing sight of Skoda’s core values. Tricky. CAR got a UK-exclusive walkaround of the new family SUV ahead of its reveal with Skoda’s head of exterior design, Karl Neuhold. Keep reading for the full debrief. Yes, but a slightly tartier and trendier-looking one, don’t you think? Check out the aerodynamic wheel inserts, the contrast-colour D-pillar and the thin, glowing light bar nestling into the grille in this high-end model. Hell, even the colour is very vogue: Skoda calls it Bronx Bronze – a new shade that debuts with the Kodiaq. And yet, Neuhold proclaims ‘we are not hipsters!’ as he talks us through the new Kodiaq’s exterior look. ‘It’s challenging because, as an exterior designer, we need to give you an expression of the car so early on. It has to look good, be convincing optically,’ he says. ‘What makes a car successful or not? That first glance decides! For Kodiaq, we wanted the car to be much more sculptural, and bring some added value not seen before. But more than anything, we wanted to show that it’s a true seven-seater – that there’s real space inside. ‘The light bar through the grille for example, we wanted to show a new interpretation of that [compared to the Enyaq] where people still know what they get with a Kodiaq. It’s not a car that boasts, we don’t want it to be that – we just want it to show off its great functionality. ‘For example, we didn’t want to have a single light band at the rear,’ says Neuhold, even though the Kodiaq’s rear lights are connected by a single piece of transparent red trim, ‘because I think for us, everyone’s doing one at the minute. It’s fashionable right now but too trendy for us.’ Ditto the coloured D-pillar insert, which is designed to draw your eye to the rear end. There’s also a distinct lack of chrome in any of the trimmings, as Skoda focuses a little more on sustainability. ‘Even now I would still say chrome is a premium feature,’ says Neuhold, ‘but we need to make a new approach. The material we’ve used, which actually looks a little like titanium, still gives the Kodiaq a sophisticated touch, and I think it gives the look something new.’ Skoda has also confirmed the return of a SportLine model (pictured in blue), which benefits from bespoke wheels, a more aggressive looking bodykit and some sportier seats inside. Those titanium-like bits of trinketry on the brown studio car are replaced by gloss black. As you’d expect, Skoda’s really thought about this. It’s remained firmly in the user-friendly camp over the years, even as Group compatriot Volkswagen has willingly chucked out physical switchgear for touch panels and sliders – and it’s no different with the new Kodiaq. ‘Ergonomics are so important for us,’ says Neuhold. ‘We just want it to be logical inside. Natural. Obvious.’ In fact, Skoda arguably pulled off a communications masterstroke as it led up to the Kodiaq’s reveal, confirming that physical switchgear would remain part of the equation with its new Smart Dials. These also feature on the . Those new dials are a proper focal point for the swish and sculptured dashboard, which features digital instruments and a large 13-inch display in the centre. The two outer Smart Dials have fixed settings: temperature control by default, or push to switch to heating or cooling your seats. The central dial, meanwhile, is customisable – settings like fan speed or direction, the audio volume or even the drive mode can all be controlled physically. And those physical dials are complementing that massive central screen, which runs on MIB4 – VW Group’s latest infotainment software. It’s the same tech that runs on VW’s and Tiguan SUV and, while it still controls so much of the car’s software, we can say it’s a marked improvement over the platform that launched in the Golf 8 and ID.3. Elsewhere, Skoda has thrown all sorts of goodies and clever bits at its new family SUV. There are three interior trim designs: Loft uses grey fabric seats, Lounge uses a suede-like microfibre cloth with yellow stitching while ecoSuite deploys either a black or cognac-coloured leather (pictured) that’s treated and tanned using sustainable practices. Moving the transmission shifter to the steering column means the centre console can store so much extra stuff with a deeper pocket under the armrest and the option to include a twin wireless charging pocket that even comes with its own air vent to keep your phones cool as they charge. You can even spec luxuries like a head-up display, massaging seats and a parking assistant that remembers your manoeuvres from the options list. Very much so. As has always been the way with Skoda, the engineering and design teams have managed to get the absolute maximum out of the platform it’s been provided. This time, it’s the refreshed MQBevo platform that underpins the and from VW. The new Kodiaq will be available as a five- or seven seater when it launches. Even if your driver is over 6’, rear legroom could arguably be measured in yards rather than millimetres, and the rear space includes high-powered USB-C sockets. There’s even a removable storage area that clips over the centre tunnel – a handy extra place to keep bits and pieces, provided there’s only two passengers in the rear. We’re yet to test the space in the third row, however, as our demonstration car was only a five-seater. As for luggage space, all of the Kodiaq’s new volume ratings are significantly higher than the already-impressive first-generation car. The five-seat model features an enormous 910-litre boot space, while the seven-seat model’s luggage area is either 340 litres or 845 litres with the third row’s seats folded up and down respectively. The Kodiaq iV plug-in hybrid holds 745 litres. There’s precious little this side of a van that can hold so much of your family’s stuff. At launch there is a choice of one petrol engine and two diesel models. A plug-in hybrid will also follow. The range starts off with a 1.5 TSI EA211 Evo2 engine developing 148bhp. This is the first Skoda Kodiaq to get mild-hybrid power, which now run on fuel-efficient Miller cycle and feature a variable vane turbocharger. It also features the latest-generation active cylinder technology (ACT+). A sportier 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine will also follow but diesel still features quite prominently in the Kodiaq line-up, with VW’s renowned 2.0-litre TDI unit available with 148bhp or 190bhp – the latter also featuring four-wheel-drive. The biggest news, though, is that plug-in hybrid offering (pictured in white) – the first time a Kodiaq has had a properly electrified option. The Kodiaq iV’s powertrain comprises of a turbocharged 1.5-litre TSI engine, an electric motor and a 25.7kWh battery pack. Skoda says that’s good for 62 miles of electric range, and is capable of DC fast charging – a rarity in the plug-in hybrid world. When we asked about the potential of a new-generation , the question was met without an official confirmation, but knowing winks and nudges from Skoda insiders. Orders for the new Skoda Kodiaq open on April 10, with the first examples expected to be delivered in summer 2024. Prices for the new Kodiaq start from £36,645 – a £1500 increase compared to its predecessor. At launch, there will only be a fairly limited range available including two trims – SE and SE L – with a Sportline model to follow. As before, entry-level Kodiaq models come with five seats as standard, and it’ll cost £860 if you want a third row. SE models come as standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, three-zone climate control and a 13-inch touchscreen. Upgrade to the SE L, which costs from £40,205, and this comes with seven seats as standard. You also get 19-inch alloy wheels, Matrix LED headlights, an electric boot and keyless entry.

383,The Vauxhall Frontera returns as a compact electric SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/vauxhall/frontera/,Ted Welford,2024-04-08,Car Magazine UK,"Of all the names that could have brought out of retirement, you’d think Frontera would have been quite low down the list, right? Nevertheless, it’s seen fit to call its replacement for the Crossland the . No longer the thirsty 4×4 it once was, the name is now being used on Vauxhall’s new that will be available as both an electric version and with mild-hybrid power. The Frontera is not one of Vauxhall’s greatest hits, so it’s an unusual name to bring back. I guess we should be grateful it’s not called the – remember that? The small families Vauxhall is targeting with the new Frontera will likely have never heard of the ‘90s version, and it’s probably best it stays that way. The Frontera replaces the hire-car-special , which has been around since 2017 and joins the Mokka and Grandland in completing Vauxhall’s crossover line-up once again. There’s no word yet on dimensions or size, but if it replicates the Crossland, it will sit under the in terms of price and trade some of that car’s style in the name of spaciousness. Its 460-litre boot is more than 100 litres larger than the Mokka’s and makes it more spacious than the Crossland. With the rear seats folded , that volume increases to a giant 1,600 litres, which is close to that of the . Bit confusing, right. Vauxhall also says there will be ‘functional’ roof bars available as an option, as opposed to non-functional roof bars… There are no massive surprises in the design department, with the Frontera adopting signature Vauxhall cues. A gloss black panel surrounds the black Griffin emblem, while the same three-pronged lighting signature as the new is present and correct. The Frontera is a noticeably higher car than the Mokka, with its roof not tapering away at all, and likely aiding its promised spacious interior. It reminds us of a from a front three-quarter angle and there’s a new split headlight design at the rear. You get more black plastic cladding than you can shake a stick at too. Moving inside you get Vauxhall’s now-typical interior comprising a 10-inch touchscreen for the infotainment and one of the same size for the dials. There’s a new steering wheel and also an optional ‘smartphone station’ where Vauxhall says the ‘phone becomes the vehicle’s infotainment control panel’. It sounds a lot like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, though the firm adds that the steering wheel buttons can be used to control it. We’ll need to try it out to see what it entails, though. It’s business as usual in the powertrain department as well with the Frontera set to use those shared with a multitude of Stellantis products, such as the and replacement for the Citroen C3 Aircross. Powertrain details haven’t been confirmed but you can likely expect the same front-driven, 154bhp motor as the Avenger, with a 51kWh battery allowing for a claimed range of around 250 miles. There will be a 1.2-litre mild-hybrid model too. By the time Vauxhall replaces its Grandland later this year, which will also be sold as an EV, it will mean all its models can be bought with electric power.

384,Angrier Audi S3 hot hatch has more power for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/s3/,Jake Groves,2024-04-09,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has revealed its feistier and more potent S3 Sportback and Saloon model for its 2024 facelift. The updated hot hatch benefits from more power and some tech that’s trickled down from the even angrier RS3. The 2.0-litre four-cylinder powerplant now develops 328bhp and 310lb ft, which is the same amount the has. Funny, that… As usual, that power and torque is sent to all four-wheels via seven-speed dual-clutch, and it means the S3 can sprint to 62mph in 4.7 seconds – just 0.1sec quicker than the pre-facelift model. The top speed is limited to 155mph. But, with this S3, it’s more about the handling engineering. Audi has stolen the RS3’s torque splitter technology and thrown it into the S3, which allows for infinitely variable power shuffling between the rear wheels. The suspension has been tweaked, allowing for more negative camber, the brakes are bigger and the steering has been given a going over, too. All of this is great for pivoting around corners, or even getting drifty with it – so much so that Audi has included a new Dynamic Plus drive mode on top of its regular ones. model and it sounds like this should have been the S3 from the start. Elsewhere, it’s typical Audi facelift fare. The exterior has been given a light going over with a new-look grille, fresh wheel designs. You can also customise your daytime running light signatures. The interior has barely changed, really, apart from a revised version of Audi’s infotainment system that can have apps installed onto it. Audi says the new S3 will launch in the summer of 2024.

385,Updated 2024 Kia Sorento priced from £42k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/2024-kia-sorento/,Graham King,2024-04-10,Car Magazine UK,"It’s mid-life facelift time for the Kia Sorento, the Korean brand’s popular seven-seat SUV. And it’s not the usual blink-and-you’ll-miss-it job but, more importantly, the price of entry has dropped by £3030. The entire front end of the 2024 Sorento is brand new, with styling aping that of the big Kia EV9 electric SUV. The most noticeable changes are the vertically stacked headlights and much bigger grille; more subtle are the flatter bonnet and reshaped front bumper. Black sill and wheelarch trim, daytime running lights with ‘star map’ pattern and new wheel designs finish things off. Inside, the centre section of the dashboard is redesigned with a logical, linear layout for the climate controls. On top sits 24.6 inches of curved display screen, split into two 12.3-inch halves – one for the driver’s display, one for the infotainment system. At a time when most other manufacturers are abandoning diesel, the 2024 Sorento is available with a 192hp 2.2 CRDI engine hooked up to an eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. Its presence in the range points to the Sorento’s continued popularity with caravanners, thanks to its 2500kg towing capacity. Two hybrids are also available: a 215hp self-charger and a 252hp plug-in hybrid. Both have a 1.6 T-GDi petrol engine and a seven-speed automatic gearbox. All models come with all-wheel-drive. Kia has yet to release performance and economy figures for the 2024 Sorento: we’ll likely find out what they are when we have the opportunity to review the car. For the trim levels, Kia has reverted back to its old numbering system: the 2024 Sorento is available in 2, 3 and 4 guise. As you’d expect, the higher the number, the more kit you get. The base model isn’t exactly lacking for standard features; the top-spec version is positively lavish. Prices start at £41,995 for the Sorento 2 2.2 CRDI – that’s a £3,000 saving on the cost of the previous base model. The self-charging hybrid costs a grand more than the diesel version of every trim level, while the plug-in hybrid adds £5300 to the price. Prices top out at £55,995.

386,"2024 Mercedes EQS - I will drive 500 miles",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/eqs/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2024-04-10,Car Magazine UK,"The Mercedes EQS is one of the longest range EVs on sale, yet a raft of updates for 2024 has pushed its maximum to a diesel-like 510 miles. It’s not the first time Mercedes has tinkered with its biggest with constant updates throughout its life so far, but this is the biggest update to date. New cells increase the battery capacity from 108.4kWh to 118kWh in the same size pack, and there’s stronger regenerative brakes that recover more energy as you slow down. To help prevent your discs going all crusty with all that regen action, the EQS will occasionally use a bit of friction braking instead. You’ll need to wait for a future over the air update for that, though. The final boost to efficiency is a heat pump that’s now standard on all models. It doesn’t improve the maximum range in perfect conditions, but it’s a much more efficient way of heating the cabin in winter, boosting your miles per kWh. Other additional equipment includes Mercedes’ triple display Hyperscreen becoming standard on all models, although personal experience suggests that’s not necessarily a good thing. More welcome are improvements to the rear seats. Despite being touted as Mercedes’ ultimate EV, the standard rear seats always felt a bit too upright leaving tall individuals with little headroom. Now even the standard rear bench can be set to a recline of between 27 and 36 degrees. The Rear Comfort Package Plus can go a little better at 38 degrees, and there’s a new slanted footrest on the passenger side. Combined with the ability to wind the front passenger seat forwards, and the optional neck and shoulder heating, rear passengers will feel like they’re flying first class and not economy. The driver even gets a bit more autopilot in the shape of automatic lane changing on dual carriageways and motorways. You don’t have to touch an indicator or glance at a mirror, the car just moves past slower moving traffic as soon as it can. Whether it’ll be enabled in the UK remains to be seen, though. Opt for 4Matic and you’ll get a large boost in towing capacity from 750kg to 1700kg in line with the EQS SUV. Expect the range to tumble, especially if you’re near the limit of what it’s capable of. Perhaps the most noticeable change, at least externally, is the option of a new ‘radiator’ trim in chrome. Aping older and less brash models, it also gets an upright three-pointed star on the bonnet. If recent model range changes are anything to go by, expect to see it on a ‘Business Class’ luxury focussed model. The 2024 goes on sale from 25 April with basic prices remaining unchanged.

388,Morgan Plus Four: the art of subtle modernisation,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/morgan/plus-four/,CJ Hubbard,2024-04-11,Car Magazine UK,"There’s a new Morgan Plus Four. Which is at once obvious – when you look at the headlights – and incredibly subtle if you take the car as a whole. This is over 70 years of evolution in action, and we have to say we rather like it. Essentially an update of the model that debuted on the new CX-Generation Aluminium Platform in 2020 and went on to underpin the wild , the new Plus Four has received relatively few visual changes, yet somehow still manages to look fresh while championing an overall design ethos that dates back to the 1950s. Under the skin, which is aluminium formed over an ash frame in the traditional manner, there’s reworked suspension and even the option of a Dynamic Handling Pack, developed with legendary specialists, Nitron. Power comes from BMW’s latest TwinPower 2.0-litre petrol. In a motoring world full of angry angles and , this is surely an excellent way to stand out from the crowd in 2024. In terms of bodywork, the front and rear wings have been replaced. Now cold formed, they feature ‘a greater level of surfacing’ in an effort to make them appear more sculptural and changing the way they reflect light. There’s also a new front splitter and a new rear diffuser – we had to look twice as well – both with a matte grey finish that makes them less visible and ‘lifts’ the main body of the car. There’s further subtlety in the gorgeous new aluminium rear-view mirrors, which despite their tiny appearance have been homologated for all of Morgan’s current markets. The front and rear lights are new, too – but you probably guessed that. Both sets are bespoke to Morgan, and incorporate the indicators for the first time, removing that separate element from the body. The look of the eight-inch headlights, which are an inch bigger than before, might be a bit much for some purists, but Morgan says light output is improved all round, which can’t be a bad thing. The standard chassis gets revised spring rates and damper valving, and can be optionally replaced by the new Dynamic Handling Pack. Developed with Nitron, this includes new springs mounted on adjustable spring platforms and new single-way adjustable dampers, plus a rear anti-roll bar. All of which suggests owners will be able to tailor the handling to their preferences a little more. Morgan says the ‘Plus Four prioritises driving feel over performance figures and lap times’, even so.  You can still have a manual gearbox – though as the somewhat incongruous BMW shifter highlights in some of the interior images, a modern automatic transmission is also available. The BMW engine in the Plus Four produces 255bhp and 258lb ft, which in car weighing just over 1000kg (dry) is enough to see off 0-62mph in 4.8sec if you spec the eight-speed auto. The six-speed manual manages the same in 5.2. Regardless of transmission, top speed is 149mph. Which is quite something to think about. Apparently the Plus Four will do 45mpg (39mpg with the stick shift), and has an official CO2 rating of 142g/km (165g/km manual). Revisions to the cockpit include changes to the Sennheiser hi-fi system, LCD screen and dashboard, as well as new interior lighting and… a new keyfob. The Sennheiser audio system – which was first introduced into the Plus Four in 2022 – is specifically described as lightweight, but now features additional speakers hidden under the seats, higher quality components elsewhere and more volume. The speaker grilles in the doors references the bonnet louvres. Morgan is keen to point out that traditional leather techniques are used inside, referencing the ‘sparingly’ used Scottish hides as a byproduct of existing food and agricultural process rather than specifically produced, and trimmed in such a way that waste is minimised. We’ve already seen signs that the firm is broadening its aesthetic approach with recent concepts and the latest three-wheeler, the , and Morgan CEO Massimo Fumarola speaks of ‘greater opportunities for experimentation’ elsewhere in the Morgan model line-up in the future. But the Plus Four is considered the ‘time-proven brand anchor’ – to quote chief design officer, James Wells – and is treated with a more ‘delicate approach’ as a result. Prices start at £76,141 on the road and refreshingly there’s no cost difference for either transmission. But there is a deeply tempting options list, which includes multiple shades of wire-wheel paint finish and a jaw-dropping number of leather colours. A further innovation (…) is the introduction of a three-year warranty as standard on the Plus Four. This can be extended to four years at an additional cost. The car continues to be hand-built at the Pickersleigh Road factory in Worcestershire. Production begins in May 2024, and you can order one now.

389,Tesla to lay off a tenth of all its staff worldwide in sign EV battle is far from won,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/tesla/tesla-lays-off-10-percent-of-its-workforce-2024/,Tim Pollard,2024-04-15,Car Magazine UK,"plans to lay off a tenth of its staff worldwide, it emerged in a memo to employees, underlining the difficulties faced by all car makers, especially those trying to grow their electric vehicle (EV) range. Owner Elon Musk wrote to staff on Monday. ‘We have done a thorough review of the organisation and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally,’ said the memo, which was first reported by electric car site . ‘There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.’ In news that will resonate with staff at X, the social media company previously known as Twitter that Musk bought in 2022, Tesla employees reported being locked out of their emails and work systems, in a sign their roles were being made redundant. Other staff will reportedly have stock reward schemes paused and annual reviews suspended. Tesla will announce its first quarterly results later in April 2024, but there are already signs that the US company is not immune from the volatile demand for electric cars. It has reduced production at its Chinese Gigafactory in Shanghai and recently cut production of its Cybertruck in Austin. Tesla is expected to announce its first quarterly fall in deliveries in four years at its earnings call on 23 April 2024. In many ways, it’s a perfect storm facing all EV manufacturers: governments and policy are pushing sales of zero-emissions EVs, but battery prices remain stubbornly high, charging infrastructure patchy at best and consumer demand wavering, throttled certainly in the UK by damaging reports in the mainstream media. And that’s before we even mention the crippling economics of Chinese EV brands arriving in Europe at scale… Tesla has not yet officially commented on the reported cutbacks. Its annual report said it had 140,473 employees at the end of 2023, pointing to around 15,000 redundancies.

390,Abarth Classiche 1300 OT: the Alfa Romeo 4C lives! But fortunately not for long…,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/abarth/classiche-1300-ot/,CJ Hubbard,2024-04-15,Car Magazine UK,"The should have been an Abarth from the beginning. Fiat’s in-house tuning brand has built a reputation not for delivering ultra-precise driving weaponry but rather cheeky, raucous cars that can put a grin on your face in spite – or perhaps because – of their flaws. Hence its great fun to see the 4C chassis resurrected again for a limited run of Abarth Classiche 1300 OT models. Created as a 75th anniversary present to Abarth by the Stellantis Heritage team (who knew?), this new two-seater, mid-engined sports car is a homage to Abarth OT 1300 of 1965. The original was also based on a donor chassis – that of the contemporary Fiat 850. Just five examples will be produced as part of an ongoing ‘Reloaded by Creators’ project. As yet none have been completed; the only physical example present at the announcement was a 1:3 scale model. Unusually, Stellantis claims it’s still looking for buyers – typically this limited run stuff is sold out before we get to see it – but given it hasn’t released a price, or very much concrete info at all really, we’re guessing the customer vetting process has already begun. Exactly. The Italians managed to produce a full carbonfibre sports car at roughly the same price point as a , but forgot to do anything about making it good to drive. Rumours remains rife about fundamental geometry issues in the suspension design; regardless, your humble scribe drove several 4Cs back when they were new, and the best thing you could say about them was that you certainly felt alive. As in, relieved you still were after turning the engine off. Add that to the barmy cacophony of said 1.7-litre turbo and dual-clutch gearbox combo, and an interior with wildly amusing control decisions and plastic toy quality, and maybe you can understand why it might have worked better as an Abarth in the first place. No-one would have expected cutting edge handling capability, and they’d have swallowed the rest of it as ‘character’. The proportions give the 4C chassis away, but it’s rebodied – or at least, the front and rear clamshells have been changed. The result is arguably a little too much like a kitcar, but the sideview is neat, and the stacked headlights are similar to the Abarth Classiche 1000 SP, a previous limited-run of re-worked 4Cs developed by Stellantis Heritage in 2021. The 1300 OT is described as an ‘evolution’ of that car. The scoop on the roof isn’t a reference. It’s supposed to be reminiscent of the snorkel intake fitted to the new car’s namesake and influence, the Abarth OT 1300. The original’s is far more pronounced and upright, but we suspect there were some modern design and safely limitations for the remake. No power or performance details have been given, but it seems unlikely the new Abarth will have any more power than the 4C’s 237bhp, and will probably deliver a similar 4.5sec 0-62mph time. For while Stellantis might have a stack of spare engines and chassis sitting around, we doubt there’s much additional development budget. The whole thing seems a harmless enough exercise, and very much in keeping with the spirit of the Abarth brand. There’s also a temporary exhibition taking place at the located at Fiat’s Mirafiori HQ displaying 38 historic Abarth models, many of which have been borrowed from private collections. And a 75th anniversary edition of the – the 695 75 Anniversario. This is limited to 1368 examples, and gets a natty black and gold paint job, but is otherwise largely like any other 178bhp Abarth 500 with all the options attached.

From Dusters , any Dacia vehicle up to six years old with fewer than 75000 miles on the clock will be eligible for Zen cover. It protects the vehicle for one year – or up to 18000 miles – until the next annual service, after which the cover renews again free of charge for another year. If owners continue to have their car serviced by an official Dacia retailer, this process can be repeated up until the car’s sixth birthday. Owners who have had their Dacia serviced by a supplier outside of the official retailer network may also be able to activate Zen on their car, so long as the work carried out was in keeping with the manufacturer’s recommendations and everything was documented. According to Dacia, the Zen warranty has been launched to emphasize the confidence Dacia has in the quality of its cars, while Steve Whitcombe, Head of Dacia UK Aftersales, wants to put owners minds at ease. ‘Owning a Dacia is all about adventure, but that doesn’t mean that owners should have to worry about the unexpected,’ he said. ‘The reliability and durability of our vehicles is well documented, but Dacia Zen gives our customers even more reassurance. In the unlikely event of an issue, Dacia Zen means they won’t have to pay out for any repairs and can spend the money on the things that they really want and enjoy.’ Seth is a former staff writer across all our modern motoring titles, including CAR magazine and Parkers.

394,Britain’s average car insurance premium smashes through the £1000 barrier,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/average-uk-car-insurance-premium-costs-1000-pounds/,Tim Pollard,2024-04-18,Car Magazine UK,"The average cost of insuring your car has jumped past £1000 for the first time, according to new data obtained by our sister website and insurance aggregator . Their research found that the average policy now costs £1361.02p, compared with £919.04p in 2022 – reflecting the rising cost of motoring and other household bills in the wake of Covid lockdowns, war in Ukraine and other inflationary pressures. Hardest hit are young motorists, who now pay an average of £1719 a year for car insurance, according to the research. Ironically, the under-25 age group are the exact demographic who will struggle to pay such lofty bills. But all motorists are being hit by the rising cost of car insurance: the over-50s have also seen their policies increase by 16.5% over the same two-year period. They now pay an average of £434. The topic of expensive motor insurance was discussed this week by the Treasury select committee. Dame Angela Eagle told the hearing ‘my constituents and many people who write to the committee feel that insurance is becoming more of a rip-off. Because the price is going up, it’s harder to make a claim; people, when they do make a claim, often have to wait a very long time or aren’t dealt with very fairly. And that’s particularly the case for insurance that’s compulsory, such as driving insurance.’ Insurance companies blamed higher costs in the supply chain for the rise in premiums: the price of new cars and spare parts have both seen the cost of claims soar, and they are merely passing the cost on, they claim. Motor insurers paid a record amount in motor claims in 2023, according to the . It revealed that £9.9 billion was paid out in car claims last year, equivalent to £1.13 million .

395,An Alfa Romeo hypercar at Le Mans? If the sums add up says Imparato,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/motorsport-plans/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-04-19,Car Magazine UK,"Alfa Romeo is methodically and shrewdly electrifying its road car line up – most recently with the release of the (below) – it’s very first EV. But that doesn’t mean the brand from Milan has lost its passion for motorsport. Speaking at the launch of its first EV – and the second model to be released since Alfa’s Zero to Zero promise (in which it’ll go from zero EVs in 2022, to zero emission sales by 2027) – boss Imparato revealed that Alfa would still love to return to motorsport. He has a few conditions to meet first, though. ‘I exit from the Sauber team in 2022/2023,’ said Imparato in his usual, direct way. ‘Because Sauber had sold to Audi at a price that for me was completely mad.’ ‘I let them spend their money in developing engines and everything,’ he added. ‘I cannot afford as an Alfa Romeo to be in this game.’ Sauber ran with Alfa Romeo branding from 2019 to 2023, but : after initially agreeing to part ownership, Ingolstadt will now acquire 100% of the team, giving it complete control of its entry in 2026. Significantly, it’ll be developing a new powertrain while also utilising all the know-how of the Sauber team’s chassis engineers. The project will start just in time for new engine and chassis regulations, and it’ll be headed up by ex-Porsche WEC and then ex-McLaren F1 team principal Andreas Seidl. So, with F1 off the table, what else can Alfa do? The options aren’t exactly limited, but it also needs to consider the history and strengths of its Stellantis siblings: ‘A rally?’ asks Imparato out loud. ‘Not me – it’s Lancia. There is one brand in [rallying]: Lancia. I don’t know if they took the decision to [join] but the only thing I can do is endurance.’ That’s right; if Alfa was go to into endurance it’ll likely go into the WEC championship – and who would argue with that. The brand already has a proven track record in endurance racing, and the most recent set of hypercar rules have already attracted entries from brands such as Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Cadillac among others. ‘If I were to do something once in terms of motorsport it would be sport prototipi.’ Imparato confirms. Well, not exactly. Imparato speaks with passion when it comes to Alfa, but he’s just as passionate about sticking to a sensible business case. And it appears that the hypercar one doesn’t quite add up right now – or won’t if you’re trying to be competitive. ‘I think they are [diverting people] from Formula One because they want to avoid to be capped,’ Imperato theorises of at least one of the teams. ‘And, as a consequence, they are spending tonnes of money in endurance. That is totally not professional. That is my view.’ ‘If they don’t correct the trajectory [they’ll have] the same movement they faced in 2015 when the season was costing 200 million. I can tell you I will not put 200 million per season, because if you know Carlos…’ Imparato didn’t finish that sentence, but his point was crystal clear. We know how Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis operates and he wouldn’t be happy if Alfa started to chuck its money at an unchecked passion project. Let’s ignore the (above) for a minute… ‘I will go there if the cost [works] for me,’ Imparato says. ‘If I have to spend more than 10% of my fixed marketing expenses in motorsport. Stop. Stop because it is not professional. And I will not support something that is not professional.’ Well, you can’t be more direct than that, can you? Put some form of a budget cap on WEC hypercar rules, and you may well see an Alfa Romeo hypercar on the grid.

396,Aston Martin DBX range revised: brawny 707 engine now standard and new infotainment slides in,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/dbx/,Tim Pollard,2024-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"The Aston Martin DBX range is being overhauled for 2024 – and the key adjustments are the standardisation of the brawniest DBX 707 engine, becoming the single powerplant offered on the performance SUV, and the arrival of the latest touchscreen infotainment from the DB12 and other models. Previously, the 707 was reserved as a top-level trim and at launch in 2022 Aston touted it as ‘the world’s most powerful luxury SUV.’ That claim was helped when Jeep’s Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and Dodge’s Durango SRT Hellcat – both more powerful than the 707 – went off sale in their home markets. Handy, that. The new 2024 Aston Martin DBX 707 is named after its metric power output: 707hp, equivalent to a colossal 697bhp in imperial horses. The Mercedes-AMG developed 4.0-litre V8 has its torque mountain massaged to 664lb ft, which might explain the prodigious performance on offer. Gaydon claims its high-performance SUV can sprint to 60mph in just 3.1 seconds and top speed stands at 193mph – both figures unchanged for 2024. It’s significantly faster than the original launch DBX, which made do with ‘only’ 543bhp/516lb ft. All of that shove is sent to all four wheels by a nine-speed wet-clutch transmission, modified air suspension and a toughened electronic differential for the rear axle, where 100 per cent of the power can be sent to the back axle. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard, too, with Aston saying they remove 40.5kg from the unsprung mass – handy for ride quality and handling. The DBX is made from bonded aluminium, like all Astons, to keep a lid on weight. Sizeable 22-inch alloys are standard on DBX 707, but customers can upgrade to 23in rims should they wish (and many surely will). Other than dropping the less powerful ‘regular’ V8 model, not much is changing with the engineering spec of the 2024 DBX range. Instead, most of the improvements are focused on the interior. The latest family infotainment is installed and there’s a comprehensive interior makeover that covers a new steering wheel, redesigned door handles and fresh air vent design. The touchscreen tech is important, bringing Gaydon’s own bespoke user interface (UI) which lets punters use the Aston operating system and smartphone app or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. We’ve sampled it and the infotainment is a big improvement over the Merc-sourced system that went before. Being an SUV, there is more space for screen real estate and the driver’s display is 12.3 inches here (1.5in bigger than the DB12 or Vantage’s), while the capacitive 10.25in touchscreen is integrated into the new-look dashboard. The designers haven’t tried to put too much into the touchscreen, striving to meet ‘Aston Martin’s philosophy of creating the perfect blend between digital and analogue controls.’ This is music to our ears: gear selection, heating and ventilation and driver modes are all controlled with exquisite-to-touch physical buttons. Naturally, Aston design DNA has been applied to the SUV shape with interesting results. The plush, leather-trimmed cockpit has been extensively developed, according to Aston Martin, to fit almost any kind of driver comfortably. Details like interior storage, rear space and visibility have been at the forefront of the development team’s minds – arguably the first time that’s really been the case in an Aston. Air suspension is standard, allowing the ride height to be dropped or raised by 50mm for off-roading or loading purposes. The triple-chamber air springs can develop 1400Nm of anti-roll force on each axle, suppressing body roll effectively. And it really does work, the DBX’s suspension system is one of the best parts of the dynamic package it offers. All Aston Martin DBX models are four-wheel drive, while an active central differential and electronically controlled rear e-diff apportions drive front and rear, and side to side, allowing for precise torque vectoring. Other minor changes to note include pop-out door handles that present when the key is detected nearby and new frameless door mirrors, like on the . Marco Mattiacci, Aston’s global chief brand and commercial officer, said: ‘With its best-in-class performance and dynamics, world-class design and the highest levels of luxury, the DBX707 immediately established a new ultra-luxury SUV benchmark. Now upgraded with state-of-the-art technology and a completely new interior the DBX707 moves the game on once more, further elevating the standard by which all competitors are judged.’ Sales start in the third quarter of 2024 – expect the newcomer to be ready for the UK’s new plate change in September, after a start of production slated for Q2. No word on prices yet, but you can safely expect them to balloon from the 707’s original cost of £189k two years ago. The regular, detuned DBX cost from £158k when it launched as Aston’s first SUV. The 707 proved so popular, making up the majority of DBX sales, giving Aston Martin the confidence to make it the default model. It’s a clever step to shore up profit margins and put some clear water between its offering and those of upstart German brands and Range Rover, whose RRP and performance creds creep ever nearer to Aston territory… Watch our pre-facelift video review of the Aston Martin DBX below.

397,Fiat to create 'family of cars' from the Panda,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/fiat/panda-concept/,Ted Welford,2024-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"Fiat to create own sub-brand using the Panda Panda line-up will focus on practicality and low cost New Panda city car expected to be revealed in July is to create a ‘family’ of cars based on the Panda as the firm plots a 500-like expansion out of one of its best-loved nameplates. Following the virtual reveal of five Panda concept cars last month, Fiat’s head of design François Leboine has spoken about wanting to make a ‘bigger Panda’ and make a more practical line-up of cars to sit alongside the ange, inspired by the original Panda. Fiat has hinted that four of the five design concepts could make production, with the first – a new Panda city car – expected to be revealed on 11 July 2024. By 2027 the Italian brand wants to have a full line-up of Panda models on sale, which it refers to as a ‘LEGO box’. Cast your mind back to the and you might remember the – a car that was meant to preview the next Fiat Panda. Cool, cutesy, available as an EV, and designed to replace a car that was already ageing at the time. Nothing ever materialised, but Fiat is now back with a concept that promises to be its new city car. Dubbed the Mega-Panda, it will be larger than the current version, and is said to be inspired by the oval shape of Fiat’s iconic Lingotto test track on the roof of its former Turin factory, including on details such as the dashboard, infotainment screen and seats. Don’t worry, there won’t be any oval-shaped steering wheels. Fiat says the CentoVenti concept has helped to inspire this new family of cars as well. The electric Panda looks set to evolve into more of a small crossover (surprise, surprise), with greater interior space than the current car and a big focus on sustainable materials. Fiat didn’t have huge success with its last pick-up sold in Europe, the – a rebadged . Yet Fiat’s trucks are massive in other parts of the globe, with the Fiat Stada being Brazil’s best-selling vehicle. The firm is saying that this new pick-up can have ‘success at a global level’ and has even said it will likely be introduced in Europe. Leboine confirmed the introduction of the truck as part of the Panda expansion, saying it will be ‘smaller than average’ and be in-tune with Fiat’s mission to keep its vehicles compact yet practical. Next up in Fiat’s grand plan is a new fastback, replacing a car with the same name in Brazil, as well as the . While a bit of a sales disaster in the UK, elsewhere – such as the Middle East – the Tipo is a huge success. The new fastback concept looks more SUV than sleek hatchback, likely replicating the Peugeot 408 for Fiat. Fiat looks to be doing what it managed with the 500 by stretching – quite literally – this car as big as possible. Dubbed the Giga-Panda, this concept teases a ‘spacious family SUV’, something which Fiat is currently lacking. Fiat’s fifth and final concept shown at its little Geneva show is a camper van. Called a ‘trusty companion’, Fiat says this concept pays homage to the ‘fun-ctionality’ of the original Panda from the 80s, and it’s based on the SUV. This seems to be the Fiat concept least likely to make production. Fiat had mixed fortunes with the expansion of its line-up, especially at the upper end of the scale. Remember the ill-fated seven-seat 500L MPW? Fiat says it now splits its cars into two ranges – the 500-inspired ‘Dolcevita’ brand, which also includes the 600e and Citroen Ami-based . And there will be the Pandas on the other side. Leboine calls it the ‘two sides of our brain, depending on the type of customers we have’ and says there will be ‘no limit’ on how far the Panda brand can be pushed.

398,Computer says no: Britain's smart motorways regularly struck by tech gremlins,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/smart-motorways/,Jake Groves,2024-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"Britain’s smart motorway network is riddled with technical errors, a BBC Panorama investigation has found – casting further doubt on the supposedly dynamic, high-tech type of modern road. Investigators for the programme uncovered hundreds of incidents when the technology underpinning 193 miles of smart motorways failed, including: Panorama claims that the technology is so unreliable that there were almost one power outage a day in the six months leading up to February 2024. National Highways insists that smart motorways are safe and claims that it has well established back-up plans to deal with powercuts and other system failures. At least 79 people have been killed on smart motorways since their introduction in 2010, causing widespread criticism (see protest at 2022’s Conservative party conference in Birmingham, above). You can watch the Panorama programme on the BBC iPlayer. Plans for future smart motorway networks in the UK were officially cancelled last year. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that any future development and construction plans for the controversial ‘upgrading’ of the UK’s motorway network was halted in April 2023. This doesn’t mean that the current network of smart motorways in England will change per se, but it means the grand project will not be rolled out any further. The Government cites both safety concerns and ballooning costs of the projects as the main reasons for the cancellations. In a statement on 15 April 2023, Sunak said: ‘Many people across the country rely on driving to get to work, to take their children to school and go about their daily lives and I want them to be able to do so with full confidence that the roads they drive on are safe.’ It’s quite the U-turn: smart motorways were once hailed the digital future of road transport (see below). The cancellation follows a report published by a Transport select committee in early 2022, which demanded a number of safety measures be implemented, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a U-turn on the policy to roll out a further 120 miles of smart motorways and committed £390 million to deliver the committee’s suggested measures. But what are smart motorways? Why the cause for controversy and are the concerns justified? From the get-go, smart motorways are confusing. The expression doesn’t refer to the whole motorway, but just to particular stretches of the M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M20, M23, M25, M27, M40, M42, M56, M60 and M62 specifically. These ‘smart’ segments, identified as more heavily affected, operate sophisticated traffic management systems to better manage the volume and flow of traffic and peak times. This involves making use of the hard shoulder—the lane farthest left, indicated with a hard unbroken white lane—and the digital signage overhead, known as gantries. There are three types of smart motorway: ‘All-lane running’ effectively deletes the hard shoulder. That particular stretch of road is considered so heavily congested, that the only way to move the volume of traffic using it, is to create a new lane, permanently. The gantries reduce the speed of all traffic to keep it flowing during peak periods. Cameras continuously monitor the roads for flow and incidents. In the event of an accident, where the lane is required for emergency vehicles, a red ‘X’ appears on the overhead gantry and roadside displays indicate that all traffic in this lane must move right. Other lanes may be closed, so this can often lead to further disruption and delay, despite the overall objective being to maintain flow. Dynamic hard shoulder versions of the smart motorway only use the hard shoulder when required. Like partially operating bus lanes, the hard shoulder is only engaged when the gantry says so, i.e. during peak periods of heavy congestion. Otherwise, it’s a hard shoulder. As the law states, the speed for motorways is ‘National Speed Limit’ (currently 70mph), unless stated otherwise. Controlled motorways utilise the variable speed limits to control traffic flow, but the rest of the route remains as it always has; three running lanes and a hard shoulder, which can only be used in a genuine emergency and for emergency vehicle access. The hard shoulder can often be abused by people having a quick wee, pulling over to make a phone call. Yet, in most cases, drivers pull left when they have broken down and there’s no alternative, such as an Emergency Refuge Area (ERA). If drivers sustain a crash, the law obliges both parties to stop and exchange an insurance details. Often, the only opportunity to do this promptly is the hard shoulder. Records show that between 2015 and 2019, 39 people have died, either as a result of the lack of a hard shoulder, or by being on the hard shoulder when it was a live lane. Unsurprisingly, relatives of the deceased have campaigned heavily against the use of smart motorway schemes, specifically the two which involved utilising the hard shoulder. The news that any future smart motorway plans have been cancelled should come as good news, even if it doesn’t mean existing ones will be changed. Deaths, while the primary issue, is not the only one. Should an incident occur, overhead gantries can change the speed at a moment’s notice. This creates confusion and concern amongst drivers who react by braking suddenly and severely, causing the opportunity for further accidents. The drivers are simply reacting to speed cameras, in operation to ensure all vehicles are abiding by the updated limit. Yet, Highways England has admitted that there can be a lag between the cameras detecting a change and the signage updating appropriately, and a period of about 30 seconds between the speed updating and the contravention cameras coming into operation. Chairman of the Transport select, Huw Merriman, didn’t conceal the committee’s frustration at the wait to have these issues addressed, saying ‘This is the Committee’s second inquiry into Smart Motorways. Back in 2016, our concerns about safety were not addressed. Assurances were given and not delivered’. While the report was rather scathing, saying the decision to ‘make all new motorways all-lane running was premature as the evidence base was insufficient’, the committee did welcome the government’s decision to act now. There’s a feeling that the smart motorways have been implemented a bit cart-before-the-horse, in that safety measures weren’t implemented ahead of their initial roll-out. Such measures include providing emergency laybys. There were 400 emergency refuge areas required to make these sections of motorway safer. However, the plan to create 150, which fell short of the required 250, by 2024 has been abandoned. They need to be 0.75 miles apart and that target simply can’t be achieved. What’s more, the committee also feels more information is needed before any further decisions are made. The government will ‘move to collect five years of safety and economic data for every all-lane running scheme introduced before 2020’. They have agreed to review these decisions on an annual basis, which by all accounts sounds like the smartest decision yet.

399,MG’s EXE181 electric hypercar revealed ahead of Beijing motor show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/exe181-concept/,Ted Welford,2024-04-22,Car Magazine UK,"is signalling another return to more powerful and heritage-influenced performance cars with the reveal of the EXE181 concept – an electric hypercar inspired by Sir Stirling Moss’s classic MG land-speed record vehicle. The EXE181 concept boasts a ridiculously low drag coefficient and (theoretical) 0-62mph time of less than two seconds. It will make its full public debut later this week at the Beijing motor show. This electric hypercar concept draws inspiration from the MG EX181 – notice the lack of second ‘E’ in its name – from the 1950s. It was a super-slippery car designed for one thing and one thing only – speed. It’s the aero-smooth silver car in the right of the photograph below. Despite packing a fairly conservative 300bhp, by modern standards at least, the EX181 was used throughout the late 1950s to try and push speed records, with racing drivers and Phil Hall both taking to the wheel at various times. Moss would hit 245.6mph in 1957 with this car, only for Hall to achieve 254.9mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats two years later. The EX181 would be MG’s last attempt at a land speed record. The EXE181 is electric, obviously, and shows MG hasn’t forgotten about its history when it comes to seeking performance – as much as cars like the might leave you to believe otherwise. Details about the new concept are still thin on the ground until it’s officially unveiled at the Beijing motor show on 24 April, and we’ve had to source details from MG’s official page on the Chinese social media site Weibo. MG calls the concept its new ‘ ’ and says it’s a tribute to the ‘roaring raindrop’ land-speed record cars. There’s no word on power, but with a 0-62mph time of 1.9 seconds, you can expect a power figure well beyond 1000bhp, although it’s all rather academic. Of rather more interest, pay attention instead to the incredibly slippery drag coefficient of 0.19Cd, designed to cleave through the air with minimal drag – a useful skill for any electric car seeking longer range and efficiency. Well, you can clearly see the inspiration with the two cars side-by-side in these design sketches. There’s minimal bodywork and the driver sits in a central glass cockpit surrounded by metal. The futuristic interior isn’t dissimilar to an F1 car’s, with a central seat and a small yoke-like steering wheel. The interior material choice seems to be knitted fabric, which is an unusual choice in a land-speed record-baiting car. The EXE181 concept is making its debut at the Beijing motor show, one of the largest automotive events of its kind, which takes place between 25 April- 2 May. There will be a host of other high-profile reveals taking place too, including the new electric Mercedes G-Class and electric . But following its reveal in China, you can expect to see the EXE181 concept on UK soil at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, as the Chinese firm takes centre stage at the event as part of its centenary celebrations. It will also mark the launch of . Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
400,Mazda’s new CX-80 brings up to seven seats,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/cx-80/,Jake Groves,2024-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"Mazda has unveiled its new three-row family SUV – the first time the brand has had a large people mover since the Mazda 5. The new CX-80, you may realise, has a lot in common with the . It shares a lot of the car’s design, albeit now the CX-80 is nudging five metres in length. Mazda says the wheelbase is 250mm longer than a CX-60 to accommodate those extra seats, and is 26mm taller, too. Mazda is offering three different seating options for the CX-80. First is a traditional three-row set-up in Europe with a bench seat in the middle for three and another two fold-out seats in the rearmost row. But, in a trend that is small but growing in this share of the market, the CX-80 can be had with two ‘captain’s chairs’ in the middle row – either with or without a fixed centre console. The CX-80 will share the same powertrains as the CX-60, meaning a 323bhp plug-in hybrid option that uses a 2.5-litre petrol engine and electric motor or a straight-six diesel engine developing 251bhp. Both power variants feature all-wheel drive. Prices for the new CX-80 will start from £48,920 in the UK, with full specs to be revealed when the car launches in the autumn of 2024 in the UK market.

401,"New Porsche Cayenne GTS: 493bhp Turbo GT lite promises driving thrills, shuns hybrid bulk",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/cayenne/,CJ Hubbard,2024-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"The final piece of the current Porsche Cayenne puzzle has arrived in the form of a new GTS model. Available as both standard SUV and swoopier Coupe, the latest Cayenne GTS gets more power and promises an even sharper driving experience, thanks to components borrowed from the awesome Cayenne Turbo GT. Yet another reason why this Porsche consistently ranks as one of the on sale. The new Cayenne GTS also gets some individual styling details to help it stand out, plus the option of no less than three Lightweight Sport Packages. What’s more, power is up to 493bhp, thanks to a non-hybridised twin-turbo V8, an increase of 40bhp. The GTS rides on twin-chamber air suspension with two-valve dampers and Porsche Active Suspension Management, optimised for on-road driving with a 10mm reduction in ride height compared with the rest of the range. GTS stands for Gran Turismo Sport, and Porsche says it’s aiming to live up to this with comfortable long-distance capability combined with increased driver engagement. Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus is standard equipment, but you have to pay extra for Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control active anti-roll tech – though along with every other suspension component, this too is retuned specifically for the GTS. Most significantly, all GTS models are fitted with same front axle pivot bearings as the Cayenne Turbo GT from the factory. These add 0.58 degrees of negative camber, making the steering more direct and more precise. You get black GTS labels on the doors and backside, plus a new emphasis on black exterior detailing via the standard-fit Sport Design Package – previously elements such as the wheel-arch extensions and window surrounds were body-coloured, now they’re gloss black. In contrast, while the standard Sports Exhaust System used to be finished with black tailpipe tips, these are now bronze. Very fancy. You’ll also note the larger front air intakes, the tinted lights and the red brake calipers. The 21-inch alloy wheels are anthracite grey now. Cayenne GTS Coupe models have the option of a centre-exit exhaust, also tipped in bronze. On the inside there’s lots of Porsche Race-Tex pseudo-suede in black, a heated GT steering wheel and eight-way adjustable seats with raised bolsters. An alternative GTS-specific Carmine Red interior package is available for what’s described as a ‘more customised look’ – but this is basically just red seat belts and stitching, so not quite as eye-searing as you might fear. See below. The 493bhp twin-turbo V8 also produces 487lb ft of torque – very nicely matched and 30lb ft more than before. It drives all four wheels via the Cayenne’s usual eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission, which is said to be ‘notably quicker’ in its Sport and Sport Plus settings, boosting the Cayenne GTS’s rate of acceleration. As such, 0-62mph takes 4.4secs, while top speed is 171mph. The all-wheel drive system is water-cooled to maintain maximum performance for longer, another trick borrowed from the Turbo GT model. But while those lightweight packages may look tempting on the options list – including a lightweight roof, carbon diffuser and reduced cabin insulation, they seem very team GT – be aware that the maximum weight saving is around 25kg. Not much on a machine that’s over 2.2 tonnes in total, yet since the GTS isn’t hauling a bunch of plug-in hybrid tech around it should still feel more nimble than any other new Cayenne variant available to buy in the UK. UK buyers can order one now, priced from £106,100 for the SUV and £107,700 for the SUV Coupe. First deliveries will be in summer 2024. All that, and we didn’t mention ‘sweet spot of the range’ once. Keep reading for more info on the rest of the Porsche Cayenne range. Porsche followed up the launch of the latest Cayenne at the 2023 Auto Shanghai motorshow with a monster: the new Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid . And before you complain that Stuttgart will stick a Turbo badge on anything these days, know that the new petrol-electric drivetrain involved here has a stonking 729bhp and 698lb ft. The only Porsche road cars to ever offer more at this point in time were the and the . The has raised that bar even higher since, however. The new Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid system, which also includes a bigger battery for longer electric-only running and faster charging for said battery, is available in the regular and the Cayenne GT Coupe. Prices start at £130,200. Amusingly, Porsche describes the new models as the successor to the previous , reminding us that the lack of that single letter may suggest there’s even more power to come in the future… We are still dealing with a massive SUV here, but Porsche says 0-62mph in 3.7sec. Since this is the most powerful Cayenne ever, that’s hardly a surprise. But you’re still going to be able shock the hell out of your passengers. Top speed is 183mph, while the usual WLTP plug-in hybrid wackiness means it claims as much as 166.2mpg combined. You’ll need to be using the electric motor a to get anywhere near that. Same for the official 39g/km CO2 minimum. When running on electric power alone you’ll still have a useful 174bhp to play with; should the bigger 29.5kWh battery pack ever go totally flat, you’ll have to make do with just 591bhp from the 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8. There’s no official electric only distance for UK buyers yet, but the 11kW onboard charger means the battery can be replenished in a faster 2.5 hours if hooked up to a . Not content with turning up the dial under the bonnet, Porsche has also fitted a new two-chamber, two-valve air suspension system. This is two business is important, because it means the compression and rebound can be tuned individually for the first time, promising improvements to ride and handling. Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) is also standard, but you’ll have to pay extra for Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) and rear-wheel steering. We’d consider both essential for maximum embarrassment of virtually all other motorists. Inside there’s lots of aluminium and Race-Tex (a kind of Porsche Alcantara), plus a heated GT steering wheel and 18-way adjustable sports seats. Comfort seats with 14-way adjustment are a no-cost option. High-resolution HD-Matrix LED headlights are standard on the Turbo E-Hybrid you everything illuminated to the max should you get the munchies at night. Other interior upgrades are as per the rest of the updated Cayenne range ( ). For markets where the GT Turbo has been ditch for regulatory reasons – which includes the UK, most of Europe and much for the far east – the Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe is also available with a GT Package. This retunes the car for even sharper handling, including 10mm lower air suspension with bespoke settings, revised pivot bearings for increased front camber and wider front wheels. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes are included, too, but you’ll still have to pay more for better tyres, PDCC and rear-axle steering. Black accents dominate the exterior, including for the wheel-arch extensions, while the roof spoiler gains carbon end plates and the centre-exit exhaust is borrowed from the GT Turbo and made from titanium. The rear diffuser and the roof are carbon, too, all helping to reduce the 0-62mph to 3.6sec while top speed increases to 189mph. The Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe with GT Package costs from £154,000, £21,400 more than the non-GT versions. Worth noting that even the regular Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe is available with a choice of Lightweight Sport packages, should you want to shed 13-33kg while keeping the more comfort-orientated suspension. These include the carbon roof, some black accenting and a centre-exit sports exhaust, and is priced from £9,074. Think of it as more of a heavy facelift than an outright new model, but the upgrades ready the Cayenne for a future battery-electric model coming in a year or two as part of . Perhaps, but there are a few bits that are of note. Can’t you see the bits of Taycan here and there? The lights adopt the brand’s signature light graphic, with four LEDs providing a piercing stare, and matrix LEDs are standard across the range. There’s also a general decontenting of bulges and creases at the front and rear ends for both the regular Cayenne and Cayenne Coupe, and there are new colours and wheel designs available. This is where the update is a lot more obvious. It’s clear things have Taycan (geddit?) a more digital turn; the instrumental cluster is now a curved 12.6-inch digital unit, and the infotainment system is also laid out much like the one in Stuttgart’s first EV. A new 12.3-inch display sits at the heart of the Cayenne interior, but customers can also opt for an additional passenger display. Stretching to 10.9 inches, it allows the front passenger to change media services or tweak navigation settings. Technology originally developed for privacy means that the driver can’t actually see the passenger screen from their seat, and this means it’s legally and safely able to show videos on the move, without any risk of the driver watching and becoming distracted. Elsewhere you’ll find the usual smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless charging is also here, and because Porsche has cooled the smartphone area, you can now charge your device wirelessly at up to 15 watts. The refreshed model launches with standard, Cayenne S and Cayenne e-Hybrid models in Europe and the UK. Go for a standard Cayenne and you’ll benefit from a 349bhp V6 – 13bhp more than before. This V6 is also the combustion part of the new Cayenne e-Hybrid model, which is mated to an electric motor and 25.9kWh battery pack for a total system power of 464bhp. More crucially, however, the updated e-Hybrid model is capable of up to 56 miles of e-range. Then there’s the Cayenne S. In a total affront to downsizing, the S now uses a 4.0-litre V8 (instead of a V6) that develops 468bhp – 34bhp more than before. As for performance, Porsche claims a 4.7se 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 170mph fresh out the box. Porsche has also announced that the Turbo GT will stay in the range, with its specific bodykit and high-performance engineering. The thumping V8 produces 650bhp, propelling the most powerful Cayenne variant to 62mph in just 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 190mph. It won’t however, come to the UK or Europe. As Porsche has already confirmed, a Cayenne model is on the way, too. Prices start from £67,400 for a base-spec SUV, or £70,300 for the entry-level Cayenne Coupe. The plug-in hybrid is priced from £76,800, and the Cayenne S will set you back from £80,800."
402,Audi Q7 plug-in hybrid gets more power and range for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q7/,Jake Groves,2024-04-23,Car Magazine UK,"Audi’s newly revised Q7 is now available as a , with a choice of versions available and a longer electric range of up to 53 miles. Now Audi’s oldest model, the Q7 SUV has been given another technology refresh for 2024. It seems Audi is happy to flog its tired and retiring seven-seat SUV-shaped horse a little longer, though a . Of course, we jest somewhat. The Q7 is still a very good premium family car, offering seven-seat space, great build quality and a smooth drive – it’s a favourite among the CAR team. Plug-in hybrids are nothing new to the Q7, it’s had them since 2016 when it was available as a , badged as e-trons, before that nameplate was reserved for fully electric models. That’s how long the current Q7 has been around… These new plug-in hybrids are lightly revised compared to before, and there’s a choice of a 55 and 60 TFSI e. Each uses a a 3.0-litre petrol engine paired with a redesigned electric motor, with combined outputs of 385bhp and 483bhp respectively. The more powerful of the two can manage a 0-62mph time of 5.0 seconds. As part of this latest update, the hybrid Q7s also now feature a larger battery pack. Increasing from 17.4kWh to 25.9kWh, it helps to increase the claimed all electric range from 29 to 53 miles. The on-board 7.4kW charger remains the same, however, with a full charge of the battery taking place in less than four hours. Plug-in hybrid Q7s are also available with all-wheel steering for the first time, along with 48-volt anti-roll stabilisation. Both are options. The updates are mostly cosmetic. New wheels and colours can be had, including Sakhir Gold, Chili Red and Ascari Blue (pictured). In addition, Audi says the Q7 now features four near-imperceptibly-different customisable signatures for its front and rear daytime running lights – much like the . Other bits of note include the fact the infotainment system can now install apps from third-party companies (like Spotify and Amazon Music). Plus, there’s a wider range of safety kit and remote parking is now available. Outside of plug-in hybrids, the Q7’s engine range remains the same as before. That means there’s a choice of 45 and 50 TDI diesels as well as a 55 TFSI petrol and the potent (and very likeable) SQ7 with a thumping 500bhp petrol V8. The petrol and diesel Q7 are already on sale, priced from £67,485, with the hybrids likely to be available to order later in the year. Plug-in hybrid Q7s also don’t get the option of seven seats. Yep. The Audi Q7 was last revised in 2019. But that was a more major update designed to mark the mid point of the car’s intended production cycle. Audi was also conscious that the far newer and were encroaching on its territory. So, it made a broad range of improvements, including an entirely new cabin, tweaked exterior styling and the addition of mild hybrid technology. Let’s face it. Cars like the Q7 are considered by many to be on Britain’s roads, so Audi hoped its decision to add a hybrid element – if only a mild version ­– would go some way to making this giant SUV a little more palatable. And, luckily for Audi, it had a ready-made system from the SQ7. Using a belt alternator starter (BAS) to power a 48-volt electrical system, the Q7 can coast for up to 40 seconds between speeds of 34 and 99mph. What’s more, the start-stop system activates at speeds of up to 13mph, saving precious fuel during endless urban traffic jams. And, for those whose prerogative it is to immediately switch off the start-stop whenever they get in a car, the BAS system is noticeably quicker than a regular starter, which should please even the most impatient of motorists. Said mild-hybrid system also allows the Q7 to run electromechanical active roll stabilisation (as seen previously on the SQ7), giving the car a tauter feel in the corners without compromising comfort.

403,"2024 Mercedes G 580 with EQ Technology - the EQG in all but name",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/g-class-electric/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2024-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"After much teasing, the G-Class is finally here. Despite being virtually identical to the ICE G at first glance, manager of eDrive Manuel Urstoeger reveals some very clever engineering bolted to the traditional underpinnings. That’s right, it retains a ladder frame chassis, a rigid (if not live) rear axle and the independent front suspension that was ushered in with the . Not only do you get four motors, but each one is also connected to a two-speed gearbox to provide a low-range mode that mimics the ICE G-Class. This allows smaller, lighter motors that are easier to cool, too. Combined they produce 579bhp and 859Ib ft of torque, enough to ping 3.1 boxy tonnes from 0-62mph in less than five seconds. If, like me, you were wondering how Mercedes had integrated a pair of electric motors into a live rear axle, the simple answer is that they haven’t. Instead, there’s a De Dion tube that allows the heavy motors and gearboxes to be mounted to the chassis. A pair of driveshafts exit the drive unit and connect to wheel hubs that instead of being mounted on suspension arms, are linked to each other to form a ridged axle. This retains all the lovely suspension travel G-Class owners have come to expect whilst adding plenty more they’ll come to love. A 116kWh battery pack is slung between the chassis rails to lower the centre of gravity and ensure no interior or boot space is lost to electricity. The pack is protected by a composite guard that’s entirely flat and weighs a third of what a steel plate would. That helps aerodynamics and doubles as a skidplate for particularly rocky terrain. The pack’s cells are shared with the updated EQS, although the G 580 has double the drag at .44 against the slinkier saloon’s .22. That might sound terrible, but bear in mind the pre-facelift G-Class had a drag co-efficiency of .53. Improving that figure whilst retaining a very un-aero shape meant reprofiling the A-pillars, adding a small spoiler above the windscreen and some air curtains for the rear arches. The ICE G gets these changes, but the EV also gains a bigger bonnet bulge to flick more air over the windscreen rather than into it, a front-drive disconnect and that largely flat underside. That helps provide a predicted WLTP range of around 300 miles and supposedly quieter cruising manners than previous Gs. However, it’s off the road that the G-Class should excel, so perhaps more importantly, you can ascend and descend the Schöckl mountain pass, the G-Class’s traditional proving ground, 14 times on a single charge. Unlike the ICE G, you don’t get traditional diff locks as there isn’t a differential. Instead, torque vectoring creates a ‘virtual’ diff lock to allow all four wheels to rotate at the same speed. Torque vectoring allows you to do other clever stuff, too. That includes the ‘G-Turn’, where you can perform a full 360 or 720-degree turn on the spot by driving the motors on the left-hand side the opposite direction to the rights. It’s great for drawing attention to yourself, and it should make navigating tight off-road situations easier, too. If the full G-Turn is a bit extreme, there’s always G-Steering. This stops the inside rear wheel and fiddles with the torque of the others to provide a significantly smaller turning circle without the weight and complexity of a four-wheel steer system. Like the G-Turn, Mercedes doesn’t recommend you try this somewhere paved like the middle of Chelsea. Instead, it’s perfect for avoid three-point turns halfway up a mountain. To make driving across your estate even easier, there’s also an intelligent off-road crawler function. Effectively off-road cruise control, it’ll maintain your speed regardless of angle or surface with far finer control than similar systems in ICE off-roaders. So, what about the thorny subject of weight? With such a big battery pack in an already heavy platform the 3085kg kerbweight shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. This weight doesn’t prevent it from being able to climb a 45-degree angle with a grippy enough surface and have a 35-degree maximum lean angle. If you’re still worried about automotive bloat, opt for the EQ-only squircle storage box on the back instead of a full-sized spare to save 40kg and have somewhere handy for your charging cables. And those that worry about water and electric mixing shouldn’t panic – Mercedes developed a new test rig to make sure the battery could survive being dunked under water, twisted, and survive in both hot and cold conditions. The maximum fording depth is even higher than the ICE model at 850mm, although this is limited by the height of the charging port. Speaking of, the G 580 will accept a maximum AC rate of 11kW or 200kW DC – good for 10-80% in 32 minutes.

404,"Meet the upgraded Tesla Model 3 Performance: faster, smarter, and tailored for the track",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/model-3-performance/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Tesla has revealed an updated version of the Performance – a sportier, faster variant of its popular . Designed to bring improved dynamics across the board, the new Model 3 Performance benefits from a power bump, but also gets a range of chassis, suspension and even tyre tweaks to make use of it. In many ways, it’s the Plaid-by-any-other-name that the original Model 3 Performance was supposed to be. The key change here is an increase in power, thanks to a new performance drive unit Tesla is calling the Performance 4DU. In Tesla’s US home market, the result is a 32% increase in peak power and 16% increase in peak torque delivery over the previous model translating to 503bhp. It’ll do 0-60mph in just 2.9 seconds now, while top speed is rated at 163mph. Tesla’s European, Middle Eastern and African customers will be slightly short-changed, however. A spokesperson for the brand told CAR magazine that cars delivered to these regions will only produce 454bhp. Somehow, though, the EMEA Model 3 Performance’s 0-60mph time and top speed will remain the same. Plus, efficiency has gone up by around 2% across the board. To help control the extra poke, Tesla has given the Performance a new adaptive damping system. It’s designed to improve handling depending on the mode selected: Standard offers the most comfort with the most adaption, while Sport improves the speed of damping and steering response. Finally, Track mode keeps offers the tightest body control – and it also dials back the adaption to make handling more predictable. It’s the third-generation version of Tesla’s Track mode, and it’s seen further tweaks around everything from ABS tuning to braking regeneration to make the Model 3 a better track car than before. As you’d expect, the use of software in the Model 3 Performance’s new driving modes means that they can be updated via over the air. The Performance Model 3 differentiates itself form the rest of the line up with new front and rear bumpers as well as a new front and rear diffuser. Combined, Tesla says the new components result in 5% less drag and a 55% improvement in front-to-rear lift balance. The  Performance gets new Sports seats designed to offer more support when driving in a more spirited fashion, but they keep the heating and ventilation functions of the other trims. The sportier Model 3 also gets new, quieter Acoustic glass. Very soon. Tesla reckons it’ll be able to start delivering the first Model 3 Performances before the middle of the year. Prices are also expected to start from £59,990, which is staggering value for money considering the amount of poke on offer. To put that into perspective, the (which is a limited-run and similarly focused petrol sports saloon) will set you back more than £115,000.

405,Lambo’s plug-in hybrid Urus SE is a 789bhp powerhouse,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lamborghini/urus-hybrid/,Jake Groves,2024-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Lamborghini’s mighty SUV plugs in for 2024 – this is the Urus SE. It introduces an electrified powertrain to the brand’s big-seller for the first time, and replaces both the regular and the hardcore . Not only that, but the Urus itself has had a bit of an update. The overall look has been tweaked, with new headlight clusters, bumper and grille designs at the front as well as a new spoiler and splitter at the rear. Those tweaks are designed to aid in aero, particularly at the rear end, with Lambo’s chief technical officer, Rouven Mohr, telling CAR that ‘you always have a little lift on the rear with this kind of car, kind of like a hot hatch,’ adding that the new rear diffuser and spoiler ‘reduces lift by 38 per cent.’ New wheel designs and colours launch, too. The interior has had a refresh, too, introducing a larger central screen with new tech on it. As well as a voice assistant provided by ChatGPT, Lamborghini says there’s also now a dedicated telemetry system and fresh driver assistance graphics. But, all of this is secondary to the main event. The focal point of the new Urus SE is its electrified powertrain, which couples a potent V8 with a 25.9kWh battery pack and electric motor. If that sounds familiar, it probably will – the Urus’ inherent DNA means it shares a lot of common bits with the likes of Porsche and its . But Mohr doesn’t see that as a problem: ‘in fact, it’s a big advantage,’ he says, ‘because it means we can focus on our differentiation – the mission for us is always to be typical Lambo in every segment.’ So, yes, the base architecture is the same, but that 789bhp and 701lb ft power output is all Lamborghini’s doing, allowing the Urus SE to sprint to 62mph in 3.4 seconds (0.1sec quicker than a Urus S) and onto a top speed of 194mph – figures Sant’Agata claims makes the Urus SE the fastest car in its segment. Some of the Urus SE’s control weights, handling characteristics and behaviours as you get close to the limit are all their own work, too. ‘While could also play with the throttle response with our own cars before, the additional e-motor gives us extra opportunities to fine tune everything and make it more Lambo-like,’ says Mohr. ‘We also have a different shifting strategy for the gearbox where we have this additional inertia push,’ pointing to the fact the e-motor will fill in the torque gaps when changing gear. Naturally, the Urus SE isn’t light, which Mohr says is ‘unavoidable’ given the extra electrified bits and pieces beneath the skin – ‘but it will be the lightest car in the hybrid segment.’ And, while Mohr adds that he’s ‘not a fan of downsizing’ if the idea of using a V6 PHEV powertrain was an option, details like using an electronic torque vectoring system to work with the rear limited-slip differential saves 20kg. Even so, it’s ‘not always about the numbers,’ adds Mohr. ‘You can clock a fast lap but be bored, or you can have a super exciting one – and you can really drift with this car! – but probably not be the fastest. For us, the excitement is priority one.’ First deliveries of the new Urus SE will happen later in 2024. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

Electric Mini Aceman arrives at Beijing Auto Show",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mini/aceman/,Ted Welford,2024-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Mini has revealed the Aceman as a new , which arrives later in 2024 as its first electric-only model. Unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show, the Aceman is positioned between and Countryman SUV. It marks the firm’s return to the lucrative compact crossover segment, which it has been absent from since the ill-fated was discontinued in 2016. First deliveries of the Aceman will start in November 2024, with prices starting from £31,800. Yes, that’s right, though the Aceman is not Mini’s first electric car, it is the first to be sold just as an EV. Two powertrains are available, both shared with Mini’s new electric Cooper. There will be the Aceman E and Aceman SE, with the former using a 181bhp electric motor paired to a 42.5kWh battery. Mini claims 192 miles from a charge here, with 0-62mph dispatched in 7.9 seconds. The Aceman SE brings a dash of extra performance and range, with a 215bhp electric motor enabling a 7.1-second 0-62mph time. Its larger 54.2kWh battery allows for a claimed 252-mile range, similar to rivals like the . The Aceman has a maximum charge speed of 95kW, allowing for a 10 to 80 per cent charge to be completed in ‘under 30 minutes’, Mini says. Mini hasn’t deviated far from its , with strong similarities between the two. It gets the same short overhangs, squared-off wheelarches and eye-catching grille, and though a bit different to its other models, still has a clear resemblance to both the Cooper and , which it sits between. Round headlights are ditched in favour of a chunkier square shape, while both the lights at the front and rear can be optioned with configurable LEDs. At 4070mm in length and 1754mm in width, the Aceman is a compact car, with dimensions in all directions smaller than a . It will be one of the smallest crossover vehicles of its type when it arrives on sale. There are no surprises in the interior department, with the Aceman getting the same matching, minimalist interior as the new Cooper and Countryman. The cabin is centred around a new circular OLED touchscreen that controls most of the car’s functions. Those who like lots of physical buttons, it’s time to look away. A range of recycled materials are used around the interior, not least a knitted textile material on the dashboard and door trims, as well as a fabric strap at the bottom of the steering wheel. These vary depending on trim. Despite its dinky dimensions, Mini promises ‘generous space and plenty of legroom’ for five adults. A bold claim for something with this footprint. At 300 litres, the boot is smaller than plenty of superminis, though. Mini hasn’t said when the Aceman will be available to order, but deliveries are expected by November. Like the rest of the Mini range, the Aceman is available in three trims – Classic, Sport and Exclusive – with prices starting from £31,800 for the Aceman E and £36,300 for the Aceman SE. Alongside the electric Mini Cooper, the Aceman will initially be produced solely in China in Zhangjiagang, north of Shanghai. It is being produced by Spotlight Automotive, a joint venture between BMW and Great Wall Motor (GWM), though , BMW has previously announced.

409,Cracking with the CODE: VW's new EV for the Chinese market,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-code/,Seth Walton,2024-04-24,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has reinforced its ambition to enlarge its share of the Chinese car market with a new concept SUV model called the ID. CODE, set for its world premier at the Auto China 2024 motoring show in Beijing later this month. The smooth lines and futuristic aesthetic of the all-electric ID. CODE represent a new direction in VW design language specifically for Chinese customers, according to the manufacturer, but the new model will also be loaded with cutting-edge tech. The exterior serves as a projection surface for AI-assisted light and display systems while the car itself is capable of level-four autonomous driving. Oh, and the cabin? A living space where the real and virtual worlds meet, apparently. From what we can see in the rendered images, it looks like there’s plenty of space, chairs that swivel for a more sociable environment and even room for your potted plants at the back. Very Kubrickian. According to VW, the ID. CODE forms part of its ‘in China, for China’ business strategy: a plan to tap further into the world’s largest auto market by designing and building cars bespoke to the country’s demands. ‘The Volkswagen brand can already look back on 40 years of success in China, and we are continuing this success story into the new mobility era, thus confirming the trust of our Chinese customers,’ Thomas Schäfer said, CEO of Volkswagen. ‘The ID. CODE gives a first preview of the future of VW in China: with a new design, a new technology standard and a holistic brand experience – specifically oriented to the needs and wishes of our Chinese customers.’ Yes. VW has revealed over 30 new models with various powertrains are due for Chinese customers by 2030, 16 of which will be part of the ID. family. Of those 16, five EVs will form part of a new sub-brand named ID.UX set to target younger Chinese customers with a driver-focused cabin and a new display concept. The first ID.UX model will be known as the ID.UNYX, and it’s set to make a market debut later this year. To shorten the length of development cycles, VW is also intensifying its relationships with Chinese partners by localising production and strengthening its ecosystem in the region.

410,Beijing Auto Show 2024: the key cars revealed in China,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/beijing/beijing-international-auto-show-a-z-of-all-the-new-cars/,Jake Groves,2024-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"The 2024 Beijing motor show is here and, as you’d expect, it’s a bustling show full of many brands you’ve heard of – and many more you probably haven’t. In contrast to the atrophied stands of the , Beijing has seen a host new metal revealed, from the all-new electric G-Class to the new Volkswagen ID.CODE. On this page we’ve run through the key cars revealed in the Chinese capital. Munich has toned down the 4-Series a little, with a range of updates designed to make it a touch more sophisticated and a little less shocking than it may have done at launch. Alongside tweaks to the grille, there are two new colours – Cape York Green and Fire Red – as well as new rims on offer. Inside it’ll continue to use the same curved infotainment screen as the current model. It’s a similar story for the , too; Munich’s popular BEV gets a matt chrome or gloss grille surround, and there are also new ‘Laserlight’ headlights on the spec list. It gets the same new colours as the ICE car as well. The era of the hybrid powertrain is well and truly upon us. Lamborghini has swapped out its Urus Performante Urus V8 for this, the Urus SE PHEV. It features a V8 engine and an electric motor that produce a combined 789bhp and 701lb ft power output, good for 62mph in 3.4 seconds (0.1sec quicker than a Urus S) and onto a top speed of 194mph. Mercedes revealed a handful of new cars at the show, but the main event has to be the electric G-Class. Revealed in concept form a couple of years ago, but now finally shown in production guise, the new electric G-Class keeps the same ladder chassis as the ICE car, but powers it with four electric motors for a combined output of 579bhp. Mercedes engineers have only managed to squeeze 300 miles from the electric G-Wagen’s 116kWh battery, mostly because it weighs three tonnes and has the same aerodynamic properties as a house brick. Don’t expect to get anywhere those figures when you’re trying tank turns or testing out the car’s sub-5.0 second 0-62mph sprint time, though. One more thing, just don’t call it the EQ – it’s the Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology or Electric G-class. No, we don’t understand why either. Mercedes’ biggest news for Beijing might have been the electric G-Wagen, but the company’s performance arm didn’t want to be left out of the party – so it brought an updated version of the AMG GT PHEV. It was originally shown last week at the Chinese GP, and it packs in some 805bhp thanks to a 4.0-litre V8 biturbo and electric motor. We’ve seen electric Minis before, but this is the first that’ll be sold solely as a battery electric vehicle. Revealed the motor show, it sits somewhere between the Cooper and larger Countryman. First deliveries of the Aceman will start in November 2024, with prices starting from £31,800. Smart is growing up. The Concept #5 reveals a new, chunkier more robust vision of Smart – and one that’ll be the biggest car from the brand when it makes it to production. Look past some of the more experimental aspects, and you’ll see a few neat touches that’ll almost certainly make it into the production-spec car; the grille has evolved into something less ‘swoopy’ and curvy than the #1, while the interior gets a swish dash-spanning infotainment setup. Volkswagen has built a new car for its Chinese buyers – and it won’t be the last.  It represents a new direction in VW design language that’s aimed specifically at Chinese customers, and the new model has also been primed with cutting-edge tech. As you’d expect it’s got several features that’ll never see the light of day such as AI-assisted light and display systems. The CODE is also capable of level four – though you’ll have to find somewhere to use it first… Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

411,Skoda has made a 1071bhp electric hypercar for Gran Turismo,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/vision-gran-turismo/,Ted Welford,2024-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"has caused a surprise with the reveal of a Vision Gran Turismo car – an 1,071bhp electric hypercar made for the online e-racing world. A far cry from the typical sensible cars that Skoda sells, the Vision GT car uses four electric motor and is said to be inspired by the 1957 Skoda 1100 OHC Spider, one of the firm’s most famed heritage models. It follows on from a shown back in 2022. Skoda has never officially appeared in a Gran Turismo game, but it’s worth remembering that, though it might sell predominantly sensible hatchbacks and SUVs these days, it’s got plenty of motorsport history. The firm has had success in the World Rally Championship, while has its well-established vRS performance division that continues to produce sportier versions of the Octavia, Kodiaq and . As with all Vision Gran Turismo cars, this Skoda concept exists solely in the virtual world. But it’s a radical-looking thing, with its single-seat design and striking angles giving it a significant amount of presence. Debuting on Gran Turismo 7, available on a PlayStation 4 and 5, the electric racer sits in the ‘Vision’ category of the game, and has been inspired by the from 1957, which was designed to compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It’s powered by four electric motors producing a combined 1071bhp and 1020Nm of torque, while also packing an 87kWh battery. You’d guess correctly, the concept car is designed for the virtual world only. But that doesn’t mean it won’t have any impact, with the concept featuring various elements that will be used on upcoming electric Skodas. These include T-shaped headlights and a matte Explorer Green paint colour. Skoda says the concept lets it ‘attract few fans to the brand’ and ‘explore new target groups and form of representation’. It adds that the gaming community has been asking for Skoda to make such a car for some time. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
412,"MG Cyberster UK pricing and spec: open-top electric motoring with 503bhp for £59,995",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/cyberster-ev/,Jake Groves,2024-04-25,Car Magazine UK,"The MG Cyberster kicks off the convertible electric sports car revolution (we’ll see) with official UK pricing starting at £54,995. That might sound like a lot, but in terms it probably won’t come as much of a surprise – although the real impact of that entry-level cost is to make the range-topping 503bhp version seem like a bit of a bargain. For while your £55k will buy you a rear-wheel drive, single-motor Cyberster Trophy with 335bhp, you’ll need to find just £5,000 more to upgrade to the Cyberster GT. The £59,995 asking price for this variant includes 503bhp and all-wheel drive via dual-motors – though the proof will still be in the driving, as frankly we’re not as sold on the more-potent dual-motor hatchback as we are the original RWD version. Still, our was fun, so here’s hoping the production car can deliver on at least some of this promise. It’s very rare for a car to be unique, but that’s the case with this zero emissions drop-top: as it goes on sale it’s the only one of its kind. Though it must be said Elon Musk got there first with the Lotus-based in 2008. In 2024, the MG Cyberster’s closest rival is the M40i, a six-cylinder petrol costing £57,565. MG is owned by SAIC, China’s biggest car manufacturer, which inherited the sports car brand and part of the Longbridge factory site when it merged with then-owners Nanjing Automobile in 2007. UK assembly continued for a while, with the final MG sports car, , briefly revived using Chinese kits from 2007 to 2011. SAIC still runs a small engineering centre at the former Mini plant, carrying out European homologation work and suspension tuning for cars such as the . But its Advanced Design studio is in Marylebone, London, where the design director, Carl Gotham, had longed to revive the MG sports car after he joined the company in 2009. ‘When I took over advanced design in 2017, our satellite studio developed concepts for a sports car as a side project,’ says Gotham. The project got real momentum when the team aligned its roadster ideas with SAIC’s electrification ambitions, and built some scale models that won approval. Then in 2018 designer Rob Lemmens sketched a proposal that management chose to be the brand’s concept at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show – and this Cyberster show car became the inspiration for the production model (shown as scale model below). While the concept could be mistaken for Batman’s weekend wheels, many of its show-stopping features are carried over to the more conventional final car, including the powered scissor doors, arrow-head taillights and front and rear end graphics. ‘The production Cyberster still has some classical elements like the proportion and the fender treatments, but they’re all executed in a contemporary and modern way,’ says Gotham (pictured below). With its long bonnet, the MG could be harbouring a combustion engine in that nose, giving those traditional front-engined, rear-drive proportions. And that classicism is enhanced by the curvaceous front and rear wings. There’s nothing conventional about this roadster under the skin, however: batteries from Chinese supplier CATL are stowed in the floorpan between the wheels. The wheelbase is more than 20cm longer than a Z4’s and the car’s wider too, to harbour sufficient cells. It also means the Cyberster – which is almost identical in length to a – stands a fraction taller than rivals. But the designers have tried to disguise the higher beltline with a black gloss hoop ringing the cockpit, which helps give the impression that the shoulders are lower than in reality. A Kamm tail is designed to trip off the air to reduce drag, and the rear decklid hides the fabric roof compartment and the motor to power it. The model rolls on 20-inch rims, with a seven hoop, multi-coloured design reminiscent from the concept, and Brembo brake calipers visible behind. While there was originally talk of 64kWh and 77kWh battery packs, the Cyberster has launched into the UK offering the latter only. Claimed range for the single-speed RWD Cyberster Trophy is 316 miles – down a little from the 330 promised initially – but with 335bhp and 350lb ft it can crack 0-62mph in 5.0secs. The dual-motor AWD Cyberster GT model develops 503bhp and 535lb ft of torque, dropping the 0-62mph sprint time down to 3.2secs. For reference, that BMW Z4 makes 340bhp from its straight-six petrol and does 0-62mph in 4.5sec. Claimed driving range for the GT is 276 miles per charge. Both versions feature 150kW DC charging capability, and claim 10-80 per cent is possibly in 38 minutes. The Cyberster comes well equipped. ‘There’s no point in doing an entry version,’ a source told us previously. ‘So it’s electric doors, electric roof, all the screens and all the kit. It’s just a question of whether owners want to go really fast – or crazy fast!’ Standard equipment includes an instrument binnacle with centre 10.25-ich digital screen, flanked on each side by additional 7.0-inch screens, with another screen on the centre console. An eight-speaker Bose audio system, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, ambient lighting, 360-degree parking camera, six-way electric seats, heated steering wheel and paddleshifters to control the regen are all included. There are four driving modes – Comfort, Custom, Sport and Track – and all the usual modern safety kit. The electric roof operates in 15 seconds at up to 30mph, while the boot squeezes in a modest 249 litres. The two-seat cockpit is driver-oriented, with the hanging centre console separating the two occupants. The door release buttons are sited at the base of this, while gears – Drive, Reverse, Neutral and Park – are engaged via four buttons, Lamborghini-style. The cockpit feels very modern compared with those ageing combustion engine roadsters’ interiors. And those sports cars are a dwindling bunch: the , and more pertinently BMW Z4 and Porsche 718 Boxster are the sole key players in the market, with the Audi TT and Jaguar F-type recently following Mercedes’ SLK into the history books. But from summer 2024, the MG sports car will ride again – and kickstart the £50k electric sports car niche. The new MG roadster was prefaced by a 2021 concept called the Cyberster. It was the work of China’s SAIC design department and developed at the MG Advanced Design Centre in London. It’s a synthwave, pure-electric reimagination of the classic MGB Roadster which laid the foundations for the near production ready car leaked above. Like its grandfather, the concept features a long, swooping bonnet – but that’s about where the similarities end. There are loads of bang-up-to-date design touches like supercar-style nacelles behind the passengers and an unusual lightbar at the rear, seemingly lifted straight from the . There are a few Union Jack LED details peppered around the car, too, like those used on the MINI hatchback. MG is also keen to point out the concept’s gaming-inspired dashboard, pop-up headlights and cockpit that separates driver and passenger like the 1960’s Batmobile. MG’s performance claims for the concept are impressive. It says it’ll be able to sprint from 0–62mph in less than three seconds, while its maximum range stands at 500 miles. We reckon the former claim is realistic but, given MG’s current battery technology and its budget-friendly ethos, the production Cyberster’s range could reduce by as much as 50 percent. Carl Gotham, director of the SAIC Design Advanced studio in London, said: ‘The Cyberster is a bold statement that looks strongly into MG’s future, touching on our heritage but more importantly building on our technology and advanced design.’ In August 2022, MG released a new video which seemed to tease a production version of its Cyberster Roadster concept. At around one minute long, the video doesn’t provide a huge amount of information, but it gave a few hints at the new car’s design features. The biggest news from the clip was that the production EV will be chunkier than the concept and it might get a pair of butterfly doors. You can watch the video below.

413,What price style? New Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4 to cost from £75k when it arrives this autumn,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/land-cruiser/,Tim Pollard,2024-04-26,Car Magazine UK,"The new 2024 arrives this autumn and the company has confirmed UK prices starting at £75k for the Invincible model when the order books open this July. However, be warned: interest is so high, Toyota expects ‘that the initial allocation of vehicles will be accounted for immediately.’ It’s described as all-new and 4×4 enthusiasts will be relieved to hear it’s not dropping any of its rough ‘n’ tough credentials or veering on-road. If you can get hold of one, prices for UK-bound Land Cruisers are: The Land Cruiser is one of the world’s most successful nameplates, Toyota claiming 11.3 million sales since the first Toyota BJ-generation model launched in 1951. Which is why there is a lot of interest in the latest version. The brand has dipped into its long archive and turned up the nostalgia for its newcomer, as it has displayed the new 2024 Land Cruiser alongside a classic FJ62 from the 1980s. An earlier teaser shot issued last summer showed a snapshot of the new vehicle revealing the inspiration for its square headlights, chunky grille and snub front nose (see below). Despite the nostalgic style, the new Toyota Land Cruiser is bang up to date in the engineering department. The big news here is the adoption of the group’s global GA-F platform, which means the 4×4 leapfrogs the older architecture to bring niceties such as electric power steering and a new anti-roll bar system that can disconnect fully for better wheel articulation off-road. These two innovations neatly summarise the engineering objectives of the 2024 Land Cruiser: to save fuel and economise, but also to ace the off-roading requirements of some of the world’s harshest environments. This car has become synonymous with use by agricultural workers, equine enthusiasts and those needing a car for all seasons and all terrains. The GA-F platform brings a much stiffer base upon which to hang the drivetrain. Like the J150 hardware before it, this is a classic body-on-frame construction, so safari game park owners can rest easy. Toyota has gone soft this time. It claims the frame is 50% more rigid, making it perfect for driving on dusty tracks and off road. A range of powertrains will be offered in the new Land Cruiser, but European buyers will be restricted to the 2.8-litre turbodiesel. We don’t yet have the full specs, but we do know it will produce 201bhp and Toyota promises it will tow up to 3500kg. It knows its target market well. An eight-speed automatic will be the only transmission choice. A year or so after launch, in early 2025, this diesel will be mated to a 48-volt mild hybrid system to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The 2024 Land Cruiser is a big car: dimensions stretch to 4920mm long, 1980mm wide and 1870mm high. Note the shorter, stubby overhangs to retain decent departure and ramp angles when offroading. ‘Tradition has been blended with modernity to create a timeless look that expresses the vehicle’s ability to withstand harsh conditions,’ says the promotional blurb at launch. ‘The styling also captures the functional beauty that’s found in the best professional tools.’ It certainly identifies as a Land Cruiser; this is still a boxy, no-nonsense 4×4, with just enough retro charm to give it a bit of an edge. To these eyes, it’s not as cutesy as a bigger Jimny and nor is it as try-hard as the over-styled Defender. Both UK-bound models are five-door bodyshells with seven seats. The new cabin can be specified with five or seven seats. Toyota claims the instruments and switchgear are designed to be operated even when traversing rough terrain. This is a roomy car and the first interior photograph confirms a mix of physical switchgear alongside the latest digital niceties; the digital screen will show off-roaders the activity of differentials and traction control systems when plugging through the mud. The first Land Cruiser to arrive here will be the First Edition model, of which only 3000 examples will be sold (below). It comes with classic round headlights and two-tone paintwork available in Sand and Smoky Blue (see below). When they’ve run out, chunky rectangular lights will be order of the day. All UK Land Cruisers will come with the Toyota Smart Connect+ multimedia system, a head-up display, sunroof and JBL premium stereo. The first UK-bound, right-hand drive cars will be delivered in September 2024, Toyota says. Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

414,Cupra's pocket rocket: the new Leon revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/cupra/leon/,Seth Walton,2024-04-30,Car Magazine UK,"This is the new hot hatch from SEAT’s racier division – say hello to the 2024 Cupra Leon. It’s been tweaked and tucked with a facelift for this year, and quite a substantial one at that. Cupra is using the car and its bigger offering, the Formentor, to establish the brand as champions of progressive and intrepid design over the next few years, with ambitions to be in the US by the end of this decade. Just as before, the 2024 Cupra Leon will be available either as a hot hatch or a lukewarm estate, though now bristling with fresh engineering and design features to modernise it for the future. It’s received a new nose to complement an overall revised front end, along with redesigned taillights and a revisited cabin to match. There are also new engines available from the wider Volkswagen Group family, plus a few bits of trick engineering like a torque splitter to up its sportier side. Want to learn more? Read on to find out everything you need to know about the 2024 Cupra Leon. For the Leon’s redesign, Cupra said it wanted to go bold with a style that ‘not all will like but some will love’. We’ll leave judgement of it up to you, but what we can see is a new shark-nose-like front end with large vertical deflectors flanking each side of a big mesh grille. The overall sportier mien is amplified by the angularity of the sunken LED headlights, within which are three additional LED triangles. Straight lines only here. Around the back of the car, a more muscular rear bumper complete with quad copper-style exhausts and a big diffuser arguably establishes a more aggressive stance, though the eyes are drawn first to the new rear-lighting signature. A light bar is still present to connect the two taillights, as was the case with the outgoing version, though it’s now finished with an illuminated Cupra badge front and centre. Oh, and don’t forget the faux carbon spoiler. Yep, that’s been given a makeover, too. The updated Leon will no doubt have an air of familiarity to those well-versed in the interior designs of VW group cars. Its centre console has been sharpened and streamlined in a similar way to the new Audi A3, though it no doubt has a distinctive Cupra flair to it. A mood of modernity and progression runs throughout, with 3D parametric patterns among other tactile surfaces. Cupra is also pushing an agenda of sustainability with the new Leon and the Formentor, using 73% recycled microfibre in the textile upholstery of the seats or ‘environmentally conscious’ leather. The top-end, faux-carbon-backed CUPBucket race seats on offer look and feel as though they might’ve been plucked from the Audi RS6 GT – our initial thoughts were that they might be too much seat for the car, but we’ll have to report back when we’ve spent some time in them on the road. A rather enormous 12.9-inch  infotainment display is also available, along with a 12-speaker Sennheiser audio system. The Cupra Leon engine line-up has also been revised, now with a few extra hybrid options. Bottom-spec cars get a 147bhp 1.5-litre TSI petrol, paired with a six-speed manual gearbox. Moving up, there’s a 2.0-litre variant on offer that produces around 295bhp, hooked up to a VW Group seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In estate format, the Leon can be spec’d with either a 2.0-litre 204bhp TSI engine, or a range-topping 328 bhp unit to turn it into a junior performance monster and the most powerful Cupra ever. With this engine, the Leon will also be fitted with torque-splitting technology to improve turn-in and agility through corners by sending power to the outside wheel to promote oversteer. Get out of shape, and it’ll send power to the inside wheel to straighten you out again. If you’d rather spec your car with a dash of electrification, there are plenty of options on offer. Cupra includes a mild hybrid 1.5-litre TSI in the line-up, complete with a 48V starter-generator and 48V lithium-ion battery for greater efficiency. If you’d rather a plug-in hybrid, there are 201bhp and 268bhp versions on offer, with an electric range of 62 miles, according to Cupra. UK prices for the new Leon haven’t yet been revealed, but we should receive them by the summer time while new cars are due by Autumn. We’ll report back here when we have them.

415,TWR Supercat: a 600bhp carbonfibre resurrection of the Jaguar XJS,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/twr/supercat/,CJ Hubbard,2024-04-30,Car Magazine UK,"The names TWR and Jaguar go together like bread and jam – so it seems entirely appropriate that the reinvention of the former as a ‘constructor of bespoke automobiles’ begins with this TWR Supercat, which is based on the . Jaguar’s grand tourer, which will be 50 years old in 2025, has always been distinctive. But the Supercat is something else. Clad in thoroughly rescultped carbonfibre bodywork and powered by a supercharged V12 that promises ‘more than 600bhp’, the Supercat is the new TWR’s first effort to claim a piece of the well-heeled restomod market. Its appearance is spectacular, but if it also looks a little like something you’d see on social media, digitally crafted by a genius with a computer, well, there’s a reason for that, too… The has been founded by Fergus Walkinshaw – son of Tom Walkinshaw, the TW in the original name (the R standing for Racing) – and business partner John Kane. It’s a ‘separate entity’ to the originally TWR, which built a legendary name for itself developing racing and performance cars in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of that legend came in association with Jaguar, particular the and XJR-15 Le Mans cars. Though there were contemporary TWR versions of the XJS that raced as well, the Supercat’s limited run of 88 examples pays tribute to the XJR-9’s Le Mans victory in 1988. The TWR name may also be familiar for its racing link to other brands, most notoriously the . The firm’s reinvention as the creator of modernised classics has not come overnight. The Supercat project has been in the works for nearly three years and TWR’s team comprises ‘a group of technical and operational talent from the most celebrated names in motorsport and performance car development. This includes: McLaren, Ferrari, Porsche, Williams, Mercedes F1 and Renault F1.’ Furthermore: ‘The design, engineering and development programme of the Supercat series sets the standard for all future TWR products and production runs. The development of this project started more than two years ago and has taken hundreds of thousands of collective hours to get to its current production-ready state.’ Those hours have been spent honing aerodynamics, durability and dynamics at proving grounds the world over. Some. TWR describes it as a ‘Super-GT’, but there’s not much depth to the info about the supercharged V12 or any chassis changes under the skin. A manual gearbox has been confirmed. Beyond that, all we really have at the moment are the words of Fergus Walkinshaw, who states: ‘We cannot wait for clients to experience the most powerful, dynamic and visceral evocation of a British icon that has been revolutionised from the ground-up to be ready for those that demand to be connected to the cars they drive, whether on the track or the road. This is the TWR way and will define this and every future project we undertake.’ But perhaps that’s because at this stage TWR wants us to focus on the design, which is certainly very striking. Those carbonfibre panels make the Supercat lighter and stronger than the XJS that donates its skeleton, and the overall development of the body is said to have taken ‘tens of thousands of hours’. Underlining the very 21st century modernism of this project, the vehicle designer is none other than Khyzyl Saleem – someone who may be better known to some readers by his social media handle, – while , of outlaw Porsche fame, is named as the design consultant. Saleem is a self-taught concept artist with an enormous back catalogue of modified vehicle renders. Notable as someone with a definite style as well as obvious talent, his designs have been making their way into the real world for several years, with the Supercat now the ultimate expression of this transition. The Supercat won’t be for everyone, but there are certainly plenty of petrolheads out there who will get it. The basic price for a TWR Supercat is £225,000 – but that’s before tax and personalisation. UK buyers will be paying upwards of £270,000 before they get into paint, trim and standard equipment choices. TWR will reveal the ‘fundamentally re-imagined interior’ when the car makes its ‘dynamic debut’ in summer 2024. From that we’d guess it’s probably going to be at the . The use of ‘re-imagined’ there is mildly amusing, as on social media TWR has stated ‘this is no ‘reimagining,’ or ‘modern interpretation’ of a Jaguar XJS. It’s a TWR through and through.’ We’ll have to wait for more engineering details to see if there’s anything fundamentally different to support that claim, but for now its hard not to make comparisons to – and all those other re-worked Porsche 911 merchants. Those looking for something different to the rear-engined experience are hardly underserved, either. Consider the , for instance, or the cars created by and , or the E-Type scene lead by – perhaps even the . Still, it is fun to see something different. And the Supercat is certainly that.

416,Stronger than wind: designing the electric G-wagen,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-electric-g-wagen-design/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-04-30,Car Magazine UK,"The is here, and it represents two firsts for Mercedes. It’s the first Mercedes EV to exist – it’s also the first from Stuttgart that doesn’t look like a streamlined, land speed record car. Where the EQ series uses tech such as wing-mounted cameras, aero wheels and bulbous grilles to slip through the air, the electric Gelandewagen makes do with the same shoebox profile as it always as. Let’s be honest, although iconic, the G-Wagen’s side profile alone probably gives Adrian Newey reoccurring nightmares. So, how has Mercedes retained those iconic G-Class looks while keeping the range in the triple figures? We spoke to Robert Lesnik, Mercedes’ Director of Exterior Design to find out how Stuttgart made the G go EV. ‘At a certain point, to make something electric does not make sense if you don’t offer certain range to a customer,’ Lesnik admits. ‘If you would have a car with 100km range, that would not make sense. So, there are certain expectations that you have to fulfil.’ That’s true of any of EV, but the G-Class comes with a whole separate set of boxes to tick. Much like a Rolex Submariner, it’s a tool that’s become more luxurious and refined all the time – but it still has to look like the original model that started the whole brand. That’s the problem with improving icons; you can’t really change them too much. ‘You cannot change the character – you do not want to change the character. You don’t want to change it because then nobody will by it because it’s not the G anymore.’ ‘So, what do you do with a car like this, a shoe box.’ Although the facelifted G looks almost identical to the previous car, it features a range of aero tweaks designed to keep its drag co-efficient this side of a building. Have a quick glance and you’ll miss them- but look closer and they reveal themselves. ‘From 20 metres you should not spot the difference,’ says Lesnik. They’re small but they add up. Updated G-Class models get reworked A-Pillars, which Merc says massively reduces turbulence. Look toward the top of the windscreen and you’ll also see a spoiler which helps cut down on the largest amount of drag. At the rear, air curtains around the wheel arches make the new G-that bit slinkier. Exclusive to the electric G is a new bonnet that has been slightly reprofiled to massage the air rather than render it unconscious. Put all the above together and the EV G achieves a drag rating of .44 and WLTP figure of around 300 miles. That’s double the drag of an EQS for example, but impressive given the number of 90-degree lines on the G. This process wasn’t easy, though. ‘You know, we were often in the wind tunnel,’ Lesnik explains. ‘These days you can simulate every car very close that what you’ll get in the wind tunnel. ‘The G- is the only car where that simulation didn’t work at the end – it was completely wrong. It was done for every other car, but not for this.’ ‘So then, you have to rethink everything and start from scratch and not give up because at the end, if you end up with 100km nobody will approve this car.’ Improvements in battery tech are slowly giving designers some extra slack. For Mercedes, the EQ class was a one-generation introduction to the electric future, but now Stuttgart is moving to the electric present. That’s why the G-Class is called the Mercedes G580 powered by EQ Technology, and not the EQG as its codename originally suggested. Styling will change too, as brands like Mercedes draw from their most classic designs as they look to differentiate their EVs from increasing competition.

417,Lotus Type 135 electric sports car – son of Emira here in 2027 for £75k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lotus/type-135-electric-sports-car/,Tim Pollard,2024-05-01,Car Magazine UK,", The new Lotus Type 135 electric sports car will cost from £75,000, Hethel has confirmed in a briefing about future plans – and CAR magazine’s new artist’s impression gives a flavour of what to expect from its upcoming new EV coupe. Our rendering by ace computer illustrator Andrei Avarvarii is based on the shadowy teaser shot released earlier by Lotus (below, and in gallery above). It depicts a low-slung sports car with a lower stance than many EVs, thanks to some handy engineering innovations, and a family look evolved from the recent crop of two-doors and the halo-effect supercar. Lotus has revealed its ‘BEV sports car’ (denoting battery electric vehicle) will be shown in 2025, before customer deliveries start in 2027. It will replace the , the final all-combustion Lotus sports car, according to senior executives and relaunch Lotus into its heartland sports car territory with annual sales of between 10,000-15,000 worldwide forecast (around double volumes of the Emira). Lotus presentations reveal the $95,000 target price for the US market, equivalent to £75,000 at current exchange rates. It brings confirmation that hopes for an Elise-alike more affordable price positioning are dashed by the sheer cost of developing a new electric sports car platform. The aluminium Elise was, somewhat incredibly, priced from just £18,995 at launch in 1995, ballooning to nearer £50k in its twilight years. The Lotus Elise ended production in February 2022 and the , the grand-daughter of former Lotus grandee Roman Artioli. Lotus has already shown its new Lightweight Electric Vehicle Architecture (shortened to LEVA), a new platform that can be scaled to different needs in future. It is the secret sauce that allows a lower stance, often made impossible by the layout of skateboard chassis and battery packaging pains. ‘It is fully adaptable to provide a platform for a range of EVs with variable layouts, wheelbase lengths, battery sizes and configurations,’ the company revealed. ‘All three layouts feature a common lightweight die-cast rear sub-frame with multiple interchangeable components. This is the Project LEVA innovation, and it means a single vehicle architecture can accommodate two different types of battery configurations.’ For Type 135, Lotus is planning a classic ‘mid-engined’ layout, which swaps combustion engine for a chest of batteries stacked vertically behind the two seats. Entry models will come with a 66kWh battery, but that can be boosted to 99kWh for more premium models. We expect the Type 135 to come with a single 350kW (469bhp) rear-mounted electric motor, although the LEVA platform can accommodate twin motors for a heady 650kW punch equivalent to 872bhp. Lotus’s first electric car was the hypercar – still the world’s most powerful production EV, according to the company. However, it is only just entering production now and just 130 derivatives will be sold for £1.7m apiece. Lotus is now fleshing out the rest of its range with five core models (below), stretching from sports cars through SUVs and grand tourers. All the ‘lifestyle’ Lotus models will be manufactured in China, while the two sports cars will be made in England. We have already seen the sports crossover on roads now while the GT was unveiled in 2023 and will arrive in showrooms in Europe in the second half of 2024. Purists will, however, be waiting for the all-new electric sports car, codenamed Type 135 and due to be built in Norfolk at the company’s spiritual home. Mike Johnstone, chief commercial officer, told CAR that Lotus was developing a bespoke platform, after a collaboration with Alpine Cars was abandoned. ‘We’re going it alone,’ he said. ‘It’s our bullseye: a pure two-seater that must live and breathe the brand. Someone who’s owned an Elise or Esprit should be able to get into the Lotus Type 135 and feel instantly at home.’ Some may consider that to be a tall order; the lightest Series 1 Elise weighed as little as 690kg at launch, thanks to its clever extruded aluminium chassis technology – it’s hard to imagine the Type 135 won’t weigh double that, and very probably much more. Regardless, the latter half of the decade should be interesting for electric sports cars; the Type 135 will be fighting for sales with the upcoming pure successor, as well as Alpine EVs.

418,New Ferrari 12Cilindri: Maranello's free-breathing V12 lives on!,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/12cilindri/,Jake Groves,2024-05-03,Car Magazine UK,"A new V12 Ferrari has arrived! Meet the 12Cilindri, a super-modern, supercar grand tourer combo crafted as always at Ferrari’s home in Maranello. Ferrari has taken to Miami to reveal its new 12-cylinder supercar GT, to mark 70 years of Ferrari in the American market. Unlike the usual launch procedure the brand undertakes, Ferrari has decided to unveil both a coupe model and a 12Cilindri Spider model at the same time. ‘Why did we do this? Because we want to be unpredictable,’ says Ferrari’s head of marketing, Enrico Galliera. The 12Cilindri (pronounced in Italian) literally means ‘twelve cylinder.’ A rather Ronseal name, but Ferrari’s team wanted to make sure the car’s heart was truly celebrated, as the feeling was they wouldn’t be able to do another V12 without any electrified assistance due to tightening emissions regulations. ‘Trying to keep the V12 was a brave decision,’ says Galliera. ‘Everyone was expecting this engine not to be possible because of regulations, Euro7 et cetera. All of the world has been moving towards electrification, including us. At that time [four years ago in 2020, when 12Cilindri development started], deciding to keep investing in this engine was a challenge but we decided to take it. But making it viable required a lot of work, so it’s basically a completely new engine.’ Absolutely none, meaning this is a direct replacement for and sits below the in terms of performance. The 12Cilindri features a 6.5-litre V12 codenamed F140HD, developing 819bhp at 9250rpm and 500lb ft at 7250rpm, bouncing off the redline at a screaming 9500rpm. While some components are lifted from , the combination of components used have led to a whole new engine. Titanium con rods have been implemented, which are 40 per cent lighter than previously-used steel ones, and the crankshaft is three per cent lighter than the 812 Superfast’s. The 12Cilindri also uses a valvetrain with a sliding finger follower derived from F1 that allows for a higher valve profile, and is coated in ‘Diamond-Like-Carbon’ to further reduce friction. The power delivery has been tweaked to deliver more torque earlier, with Ferrari’s chief product development officer Gianmaria Fulgenzi saying that 80 per cent of the torque is accessible at 2500rpm. The V12 is mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission – a first for a V12 Ferrari – which features five per cent shorter gears and a 30 per cent reduction in shifts compared to the 812. ‘We had to give it the perfect gearbox,’ says Fulgenzi, ‘and it shifts like a gun.’ And not just because of just how quick each gear shifts, but of the sound emitted each time it does so. As for the structure of the car, the 12Cylindri has a 20mm shorter wheelbase than the 812 it replaces. The overall chassis has fewer castings (17 instead of 22), which has meant an increase in stiffness by around 15 per cent, and this is also the first time a Ferrari has used recycled aluminium panels. Weight distribution is tipped at 48.3/51.7 per cent front/rear. And, because it’s a Ferrari, there are tonnes of digital systems. Side Slip Control 8.0 is the latest version of the car’s drifty traction control system, brake-by-wire ABSevo is applied and rear-wheel steering that first launched on the 812 Competizione features here. The entire performance package allows a 0-62mph sprint is dealt with in 2.9 seconds, 0-124mph is over in less than 7.9 seconds and the 12Cilindri maxes out at more than 211mph. Yes, let’s. To our eye, and to that of Ferrari’s Chief Creative Officer, Flavio Manzoni, the 12Cilindri has taken some design inspiration from , with a striking black band that stretches the width of the nose. Manzoni says he’s been inspired by ‘sci-fi, aeronautics and space age design’ here, adding that the 12Cilindri’s shallow and sharp headlights ‘are like wings.’ Indeed, the DRL shapes look like they stretch beyond the width of the front end, cutting through the air light backlit ailerons. Manzoni is also keen to keep that panel black to keep the car’s design character – ‘please, no!’ he exclaims as a member of the media suggests painting them in body colour. The car is, naturally, low to the ground and incredibly long (it’s about 80mm longer), with the rear end sloping gently before dropping off almost vertically. Rear lights that are akin to the and are applied here – Manzoni says the round lights seen in Ferrari’s past ‘are obsolete and too traditional’ – flank a large rear window that stretches to the very lip of the rear end. Instead of a fixed, singular wing, two active panels that flank the rear window raise and lower depending on the speed. The wings raise up to 50 degrees at speeds above 37mph to increase downforce to the rear axle, but then drop again above 186mph. ‘We’ve started a new era and design philosophy with this car,’ says Manzoni, hinting that we’ll see a continuation of some of these design cues on future models. Very much modern Ferrari in here. Given the car is technically Ferrari’s grand tourer, the craftsmanship and interior layout has a more user-friendly design than something more performance focused. But, naturally, Manzoni and his design team are keen to still keep the nods to other models coming; the dashboard, for example, is relatively symmetrical with what looks to be a cowled panel area for both the driver and the passenger. Both occupants get their own display and, in a departure from Ferrari’s recent norm of not offering a central screen (like on the 296 GTB, SF90 Stradale and ), there’s a big glossy one slap bang in the centre. Still, Ferrari’s maintaining that its infotainment doesn’t come with native navigation, as most mirror their smartphone anyway. Ferrari says the new V12 supercar will be priced from €395,000 for the coupe model in Italy, which is described as a ‘drive away price’ with local taxes included. That translates to roughly £338,000 like-for-like in the UK. The 12Cilindri Spider will start at €435,000 in Italy, directly translating to roughly £372,000 in the UK. Of course, as all Ferrari’s are built to order, that almost certainly won’t be the price most people pay. Galliera says that most clients will likely spend over €500k (around £428k) on their 12Cilindri. Deliveries start towards the end of 2024 on the Continent, with first right-hand drive UK cars likely arriving within the first couple of months of 2025.

419,Li Auto Mega: the electric MPV with less drag than a Porsche Taycan,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/li-auto/mega-ev/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-05-03,Car Magazine UK,"The Beijing auto show felt more like a tech convention than a motor show, with hundreds of people gathered around shiny new products from brands you’ve probably never heard of. But in the same way and Huawei (who now make EVs in China by the way) produce Android phones that look relatively similar to each other, all the EVs and range-extenders (which are particularly big in China) can turn into an analogous ball of mobility. That is, all except the Li Auto Mega. Penned by ex-Porsche designer Ben Baum (whose work includes the current ), and with a brand mission closer to Apple than Ford, its sci-fi curves cut a rarely distinctive figure on the show floor. So much so, that we had to go and find out about Li Auto’s first full electric car. It does! That comes from the super clean lines – a permanent fixture of Baum’s vision for Li Auto’s line-up – as well as the need for space and a range of at least 700km (CLTC) – no mean feat considering its 5350mm length, 1965mm width and 100kWh battery. ‘The only way we could solve this problem is to have a very, very low aerodynamic value: 0.215Cd. It’s a better drag coefficient than the (0.22 Cd), and that’s also enabled us to give it this really nice silhouette,’ he adds. A spec sheet reveals the Mega can achieve 710km CLTC from its 102.5kwh battery, so that’s mission accomplished. As for CLTC? It’s short for China Light-Duty Vehicles Test Cycle – and it’s essentially the same as WLTP, with the main difference being that it’s carried out at lower speeds. As a result, the range figures it produces are usually around 10-15% more generous than the WLTP figures we’re used to. Take the . It has a 425km (264 mile) CLTC range, and a 350km (217 mile) WLTP range. So all things roughly translated, the Mega can do around 350 miles on a tank. Power comes from a 155kW motor at the front with 232Nm of torque and a rear motor with 245kW and 310Nm of torque. A combined 400kW and 542Nm means it’ll hit 0–62mph in an extremely unnecessary 5.5 seconds. Of course, the Mega’s design isn’t borne from the wind tunnel alone, with some very deliberate styling touches that set the tone relatively new brand. ‘Our concept is Halo light, which means we see the front and rear as one Halo ring,’ Baum tells us on the busy show floor. ‘So that’s why the front light and the rear light [is] always connected on the same level.’ ‘Many companies are having a [light bar] in the front now, but we really, really care that it’s not interrupted. It’s one single line. It has no cut lines in between so you can really read it.’ The Mega has black U-shaped area underneath the light bar, and it’s here that it hides all the autonomous-enabling technology you’d expect in a modern EV. It’s a neat idea and unsurprisingly feels like a very ‘Stuttgart’ solution. At the rear, the Halo continues as a futuristic brake light, and it’s contained in a breadvan-like abrupt stop which ends the glasshouse mid-curve. ‘This is where the airflow separates, and it’s why we actually were able to get this very low drag coefficient,’ Baum explains. ‘For electric cars we added seamless to the brief,’ says Baum, who later explains how the popularity of Range extenders in China means this is the first non-REX car in the Li Auto line up. ‘It should be a very, very seamless car, everything should be integrated.’ Space – along with price – appears to be a key metric for Chinese consumers and the Mega has this in spades. Open the Mega’s doors, and the interior feels bright and airy. Creating a space for families is a key aim of the brand: ‘In the second row you have more space than a BMW 7-Series, and in the third row you have more space than a BMW 5-Series,’ Baum tells us. ‘It’s very spacious car, and it’s comfortable on all seven seats.’ Tech is of course front and centre in the Mega, and it’s here to work for families: USB-C sockets and wireless chargers are on what feels like every flat surface, and bi-directional charging for camping trips and other situations. There’s also a pair of 3K OLED 15.7-inch screens up front for the passenger and driver and, just behind them, the first row of passengers get a 17-inch OLED screen that flips down from the ceiling. The Mega backs up the sights with sounds too; it boasts a 2160 watt 21-speaker system, capable of Dolby Atmos for 3D sound. The intelligent glue for all of this – as well as the Mega’s autonomous systems – is AI. ‘What really makes this brand is the artificial intelligence in the car,’ Baum reveals. ‘We have Mind GPT (an off-shoot of Chat GPT) inside). You can say open this window, you point at the window, and it opens the window, close this screen, open the screen, whatever. You can say I’m a little bit a little bit hot, and it will automatically turn on the AC and so on.’ It’s an impressive feature set for a car that retails at ¥529,800 Chinese Yuan or just under £60,000 in pounds. It goes big on both tech and styling, in that order, and that’s no coincidence; Baum explains that for Li Auto, a proper marriage between hardware and software is essential for the best product. And a strong style is just as important to break through the new crop of similar looking EVs flooding the market. It’s no surprise, then, that in an EV market that increasingly feels like the smartphone one, Li Auto is following Apple’s example. Baum says: ‘It’s very important to create a brand design language which works with the brand language as well and with the brand mission. If you’re not an established brand like BMW or Mercedes or Porsche, for example, you have to do that. Otherwise, people will not recognise you. ‘It’s kind of how Apple does their whole ecosystem. You will always see it’s an Apple product because everything works together: brand, mission, vision and design. We’re really trying to create something holistic. Sometimes it’s a bit hard, but I think we’re on the right path.’ We think so too. Not right now. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

420,Bentley Batur Convertible is the W12 engine's swansong,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bentley/batur-convertible/,Graham King,2024-05-07,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Batur Convertible, the really rather special follow-up to the million-pound Batur Coupe that was released into the world in 2023. Like its hardtop sibling, the two-seat Batur Convertible is an ultra-limited edition that’s built by Bentley’s in-house bespoke division, Mulliner. More significantly, it’s also the last car to be fitted with the iconic 6.0-litre W12 engine. That engine was first seen in 2003 when the original Continental GT was launched. With two turbos bolted on, the W12 gave the Conti an immense, effortless turn of speed that echoed the performance of iconic vintage Bentleys such as the Speed Six and 8-Litre. Indeed, it was a key factor in the unprecedented success of the Continental GT – it’s the car that saved Bentley’s bacon, after all. In the Batur Convertible, the W12 produces 740bhp – 40% more power than the first version – and a towering 738lb/ft of torque. The has the same engine, delivering a 0-62mph time of 3.4secs and a top speed of 209mph, figures that make it the fastest Bentley ever short of Le Mans-winning Speed 8. Expect similar results for the Convertible. Like the Batur Coupe – and the earlier – the Batur Convertible is based on the same platform as the current, third-generation but wears a completely bespoke body. Designed and crafted by Mulliner, it’s intended as a tribute to, and celebration of the coach built open top cars that made Bentley’s early reputation. Bentley says the Batur’s styling informs that of its next generation of cars, including EVs. At the front, its bonnet line slopes down more steeply to a shallower grille than is seen on the Conti; the rear is more angular with a pronounced spoiler integrated into the boot lid; there are slimline head and tail lights. It’s a very handsome thing, a future we can get behind. The Convertible features a body-colour “airbridge” behind the seats, spanning the tops of tapered cowls that slope down towards the rear. The fabric roof raises and lowers in 19secs at speeds up to 30mph; when raised, Bentley claims it creates a “cossetting environment.” As you’d expect in a super-luxe interior. The Batur’s dashboard is familiar from the Conti GT, though the centre console design is unique to the car. Thankfully, there are actual buttons on it – it seems owners at this level aren’t keen on haptic pads. The centrepiece is the 3D printed rose gold encircling the drive mode selector that’s made in Birmingham’s world-famous Jewellery Quarter. Practical considerations haven’t been overlooked, either. Behind the two seats, there’s a semi-enclosed storage space for bags and coats. Just 16 Batur Convertibles will be built, matching the number of Coupes. As you’d expect, each buyer has virtually completely free rein to specify – or “co-create,” as Bentley puts it – their car, working with Mulliner’s design team. Colour choice is “infinite” and can be mixed and matched across every part of the car’s bodywork. Any combination of exterior metalwork – including titanium – can be used. Interior finishes are limited more by imagination than anything else. The car pictured here is the engineering prototype. It’s finished in Vermilllion – gloss on the upper half, satin on the lower half – with carbon fibre front splitter, side skirts and diffuser. Other elements are finished in various sorts of titanium with black and Vermillion accents. How deep do your pockets need to be? Extremely. Very extremely. The Coupe cost £1.65 million even before you went nuts on the “specially created Mulliner visualiser.” Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"
421,Ford could cut UK ICE sales to meet EV sales targets,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ford/ice-ev-sales/,Graham King,2024-05-08,Car Magazine UK,"Ford may restrict UK supplies of combustion-engine (ICE) cars in an effort to meet (EV) sales targets, the company’s European head has said. The comments come amid lower than expected EV demand in the UK and across Europe. Speaking at the Financial Times’ annual Future of the Car summit, Martin Sander said: “We can’t push EVs into the market against demand. We’re not going to pay penalties. We are not going to sell EVs at huge losses just to buy compliance. The only alternative is to take our shipments of [ICE] cars to the UK down and sell these vehicles somewhere else. “I don’t know if consumers in the UK would like seeing [ICE cars] prices going up,” Sander added. He also noted that the speed of the EV switch was ultimately “down to the consumer.” As of 1 January 2024, most UK car manufacturers are subject to the Government’s . Under the mandate, they have to meet a quota for sales of ZEVs – that basically means battery electric vehicles, though alternative powertrains such as hydrogen fuel cells also count. In 2024, that quota is 22% of all cars each manufacturer sells. The number increases aggressively to reach 100% in 2035. Manufacturers that miss the quota will be fined £15,000 for every excess ICE car sold. But EV sales are lagging behind expectations. New car registration figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed that, in the year to the end of April 2024, EVs account for just 15.7% of the market. That’s more than six percent below the Government’s target. Demand for EVs is growing, but the SMMT notes that the growth is driven entirely by fleets and company cars drivers, “predominantly due to compelling fiscal incentives.” By contrast, demand from private retail buyers has been falling for many months. In April 2024, less than 15% of new EVs went to such buyers. “The lack of government support for private motorists remains a barrier that cannot be overcome by industry alone,” the SMMT said. Ford had originally planned to have an all-EV line-up in the UK and Europe by 2030, however Sander described that target as “irrelevant.” He added: “Demand is behind our expectations now and we are not hitting our ambitious targets. Everyone is getting extremely nervous. “We are committed to zero emissions. We just need to be reasonable about it and together find a way to manage to get to net zero in a profitable way.” Ford currently only has one electric car available in UK showrooms – the . It will be joined later in 2024 by the VW-based and an electric version of the Puma will arrive in 2025. Electric Tourneo MPVs and a coupe-SUV are also in the works.

422,"New Renault Rafale hybrid SUV flagship gets priced, UK spec details",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/rafale/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-05-08,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has announced pricing and spec details for its new range-topping SUV coupe – the Renault Rafale. Competing in the heavily congested , the Rafale promises ‘the best mpg figures in its segment’ and as much as 296bhp – though not at the same time. The starting price of £38,195 gets you the 197bhp variant, which combines a 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine with two electric motors and a clutchless automatic ‘dog box’ transmission. There are three trim levels, infotainment by Google, and some fancy options, including a variable tint Solarbay glass roof. ‘The all-new Renault Rafale is central in the Renaulution, symbolises our move upmarket and shows that we belong in every customer segment,’ said Fabrice Cambolive, Renault CEO. ‘With its captivating coupe SUV design crafted for intense experiences, it provides unprecedented driving pleasure with its hybrid powertrains and a standard-setting chassis brimming with passion and know-how from Renault engineers.’ Because Renault used to make aero engines and actually manufactured the Caudron-Renault Rafale (below) in 1934. It’s also something to do with wind. Sorry, the wind. In French. The Rafale is the first car to bear the full weight of Renault’s new design language. 4710mm long, 1860mm wide and 1610mm tall, the Rafale hides its considerable size with some sporty features; the roofline curves down at the rear for a more ‘swoopy’ look, while a wide track and windscreen with seventeen degrees of rake make it feel somewhat more dynamic. The front of the Rafale also features the brand’s new headlight signature – originally debuted on the ‘The all-new Renault Rafale is sized to give it a status-symbol aura, its design is vibrant, and it has a powerful personality,’ said Alexis Martot, Renault’s head of exterior design. ‘So, it naturally stands out as the Renault brand’s new flagship.’ Underpinning the new range-topper is the Renault group’s CMF-CD architecture. Just two powertrains will be offered – both E-Tech petrol-electric hybrids. Available to order now for first deliveries in July 2024 is the 1.2-litre turbo full hybrid with 197bhp. This, Renault says, will do 60.1mpg and emit just 105g/km CO2, helping to achieve a total claimed range of up to 638 miles. The combustion engine uses the Miller cycle, has low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, variable-geometry turbo and a ‘diesel-like’ long stroke design – all in the name of efficiency. The main electric motor contributes 50kW (67bhp) and 151lb ft, essentially doubling the petrol engine’s torque. A second electric motor acts as a starter generator and powers the clutchless automatic transmission; this motor has 25kW (33.5bhp) and 37lb ft to get the job done. Sounds complicated, and is, and Renault hasn’t always got these systems entirely right. For the Rafale here’s hoping it’s a smooth implementation. There are four regen modes and this version of the Rafale is front-wheel drive. It will do 0-62mph in 8.9sec and has a top speed of 111mph. Those seeking higher performance – and perhaps a more dynamic drive – will need to wait a little longer for the 296bhp model, which arrives later in 2024. This Rafale E-Tech 4×4 has, as the name suggests, four-wheel drive. Higher-spec models also come with ‘4Control Advanced four-wheel steering’, delivering 1 or 5 degrees of rear-axle adjustment, depending on vehicle speed. The Renault Rafale comes in three trim levels Techno, Techno Esprit Alpine and Iconic Esprit Alpine. Standard kit includes 20-inch alloys, automatic headlights, 12.3-inch driver display, 12.0-inch infotainment screen, six-speaker hi-fi, wireless phone charging, dual-zone air-conditioning, front rear parking sensors, reversing camera, and regen paddles on the steering wheel. Techno Esprit Alpine adds a different wheel design, Esprit Alpine exterior styling, matrix LED headlights and four-wheel steering. On the inside there’s 61 per cent recycled Alcantara upholstery, quilted, perforated and adorned with an illuminated Alpine logo. The front seats are six-way electric with heating, plus massage function for the driver. The rear armrest includes charging ports and moveable arms for holding ‘devices’. You also get a head-up display. Iconic Esprit Alpine adds the fancy Solarbay glass roof. This uses AmpliSky technology to replace blinds with variable tint, in a manner that’s not been seen on any previous car. There are nine individual segments of Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal, enabling four modes – all light, all dark, or split front and rear. You can even control it by voice. Other Iconic features include logo puddle lamps, electric folding mirrors, 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio, ‘hands-free’ parking, and a 360-degree camera system. All models have the OpenR infotainment system with Google baked in. Which not only means the Google voice assistant and Google Maps for nav, but also up to 50 apps. In addition to that, Renault confirms the Rafale will be available with up to 32 bits of ADAS. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

423,"VW boss Thomas Schäfer on an electric Golf, the Polo's survival and more",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/thomas-schafer/,Phil McNamara,2024-05-08,Car Magazine UK,"The next all-new Golf will be electric-only, the Polo supermini will soldier on until 2030 at least and VW is progressing with a sub-€20,000 electric hatch below the forthcoming ID.2, Volkswagen brand boss Thomas Schäfer has confirmed in a wide-ranging interview. Schäfer outlined the challenges when planning the future of the humble VW hatchback, given the car market’s rocky transition to electric, tightening EU regulations and customers’ ongoing love affair with SUVs. Speaking to five UK journalists at the Financial Times’ tenth Future of the Car summit, Schäfer was blunt that the SUV bubble showed no sign of bursting. ‘The trend is still there… If we take [our models] away, chances are customers will go somewhere else. The small SUVs – the T-Roc, , are super in demand. It’s very good business.’ Does that mean the Golf – celebrating its 50 anniversary this year – is becoming irrelevant and won’t exist in 20 years, asked CAR? ‘The Golf is a phenomenon. It’s a timeless car, ideal for anybody from a student getting into mobility to a CEO driving the GTI. ‘The Golf has always been very constant but it has always brought technological advancement too. No matter when it is, . We’ve just brought in with diverse powertrains but [after that] to bring in a whole new Golf with combustion engines is just not worth it in the total numbers.’ In 2023, VW sold just over 300,000 Golfs, with VW group volumes bolstered in the hatchback segment by 205,000 Skoda Octavias, 100,000 Cupra and SEAT Leons and 246,000 Audi A3s. ‘This is all based on the MQB-A platform which is super cost effective with a number of models from various brands,’ said the VW brand chief. ‘If everybody wants to do it themselves, it kills you on the [scale].’ That’s 851,000 midsize hatchbacks across the group – but VW’s top-selling model, the Tiguan, sold 633,147 units alone in 2023 for comparison. ‘It wasn’t long ago that the company was a strong fanbase of non-SUVs, before 2015! But when we brought them out you could see the success, the Tiguan, T-Roc, super-successful cars, good margins.’ And will this new electric Golf be called ID.Golf? ‘We will only call it Golf if it’s a Golf, from the proportions to the performance. We have put the first definition together, the first design sketches with the proportions and that bodes well.’ VW has previously intimated a swing back to its heritage nameplates, and the ID tag is likely to be phased out as core models are electrified. The Golf’s little brother, the Polo, will be a fixture in VW showrooms for longer now, thanks to the European Union pushing back tough emissions regulations from 2025 to 2030. Car makers’ protests that expensive exhaust treatments would have made superminis unprofitable appear to have been heard. ‘The Polo will definitely carry on until the end of the decade. Euro 7 has been done in a reasonable way: it adds cost to vehicles but not too crazily,’ explained the boss. Car makers will still be compelled to clean up brake and tyre particulates nonetheless. ‘What adds tremendous cost is the GSR2 safety regulation, with interior cameras and a couple of things you need to add to the platform. That is a real cost complication but we’ve now done it across the brands and we can carry on. We’ll keep the Polo fresh and it will be a good entry into our brand,’ says the 54-year-old CEO. But the company is working on another entry point: an electric city car, dubbed ID.1, which could arrive in late 2027. That’s in addition to the ID.2, the €25,000 small hatch revealed as a concept car in spring 2023. Its 4m-length is about the same size as the Polo’s – the ID.1 would slot in beneath it and effectively replace the Up! city car, which ceased production last year. The ID.1 would rival Renault Group’s Dacia Spring, the Chinese-built EV that will cost from £14,995 when UK sales begin in October. Dacia’s 3.7m-long hatch has a 137-mile range (220km). But Schäfer ruled out importing the ID.1 from China, despite VW working on four entry-priced models on a new CMP platform there: ‘China is for China.’ He continued: ‘We have four €25,000 [electric] cars coming across the brand group. They are super vehicles with no compromises on looks, safety, quality, range. ‘Do we need to go further, lower? Absolutely. We’re working on that. Why does it take so long? Because we need to make cars that fit to the VW DNA without compromises and still meet the price point.’ But the ID.1 – which would cost less than €20,000 – is not a done deal. Schäfer reiterated there are four options for the business case, including co-operation with an external partner (Renault has been strongly tipped and very vocal about working with others), internal pooling and scaling it across multiple regions. ‘I’d like to make it happen,’ says the CEO. ‘But if it’s not feasible and it doesn’t make sense we’re not going to make it.’ VW is exploring 300km (186 miles) of range for the city car: ‘you cannot offer a car that can only do 150km or something, it makes it cheap but it’s just going to annoy customers,’ says Schäfer. ‘You need enough range so you don’t run out within a day; otherwise customers could buy a plug-in hybrid with over 100km of range.’ He concluded: ‘The current EV slump that we see in Europe, it’s not really affecting the decision, because this is a car that would come in after the ID.2 so probably 2027 onwards. It just needs to be done properly. It’s a very, very sharp pencil to get this into profitability, it has to earn money. The [final] decision we’re trying to get done before summer – and then we’re ready to go.’"
424,Ferrari reveals new 499P Modificata hypercar with one key detail,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/499p-modificata/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-05-09,Car Magazine UK,"Last year, Ferrari revealed the 499P Modificata, a customer-friendly version of its Le Mans-winning hypercar. Fast-forward to this year Maranello has posted a specially customised version of the hypercar on X – with one intriguing detail. The car pictured below is painted in a fetching black and yellow colour scheme, but F1 fans will be more interested in the 44 number it’s carrying. That’s the racing number for seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who’ll soon be joining the Scuderia in 2025. Black and yellow edition ⚫️🟡 Fun marketing exercise, or a car that the Englishman has already pre-ordered? Either way, it looks great. Keep reading for more on the 499P Modificata. Ferrari already has a reputation for bringing its wealthiest, most valued customers right into the fold, but it’s just taken things up a notch with this; the 499P Modificata. Just revealed at Finali Mondiali, Ferrari’s annual bash in Mugello, it’s a track-only racecar heavily based on the 499P that won earlier this year. Simply put, it’s a €5.1 million ticket (before tax) into one of Maranello’s most sophisticated racing programs. From the outside at least, the 499P Modificata looks identical to the hypercar that won the Le Mans centenary in June, but Maranello’s engineers have tweaked a significant amount under the high-downforce bodywork. Their aim? To make it easier to maintain and more suited to the gentleman drivers lucky enough to get behind the wheel. The Modificata uses a lightened version of the mid-rear mounted V6 found in the 296 GT3 race car, albeit with different engine mappings and electronic controllers. It’s mated to an F1-derived battery and a 200kW hybrid system that, significantly, doesn’t need to adhere to the ACO’s strict hypercar regulations. While the racecar proper can only deploy its hybrid power beyond speeds of 190km/h (118mph) to achieve performance parity with LMDh cars, the Modificata can power the front axle from a standstill. That gives it increased traction and torque out of corners and a smoother power delivery. After ‘unlocking’ the potential of the hybrid system, Ferrari engineers spent time calibrating the power delivery of both axles. And just like the race car, it can recover energy through braking. Overall power is up to 858bhp, but the 499P Modificata has a further trick up its sleeve: a push to pass button – just like one you’d find in the F1 car – gives the driver a further 161bhp of power for seven seconds at a time. The Modificata will run on bespoke Pirellis rather than the ACO-mandated Michelins of the race car. Featuring F1-derived tech, the key focus has again been on driveability and handling feedback – as well as a reduction in warm-up times and degradation. The ethos is simple: trade some peak performance for usable, predictable performance. The suspension system has been overhauled too; the Modificata will still use a state-of-the-art pushrod solution but it’ll now be more drivable and predictable. After all, this isn’t designed to be a race car, but a taste of what a 2023 Hypercar can do. Finally, the drivers’ seat has been widened to better accommodate the different, more varied body shapes of Ferrari’s prospective Sport Prototipi clients. The 499P Modificata is the first chapter in Ferrari’s new Sport Prototipi Clienti program, and will run parallel to the F1 Clienti program. Throw in the Ferrari Challenge too, and there are now a few routes into the inner circles of the Scuderia – providing you have the cash. The 499P Modificata experience can be yours for €5.1 million before tax, though that includes two years of proper track support: at Ferrari organised events, Modificata owners will have a track and team of mechanics at their disposal. Each chassis will be made new and not adapted from any existing race or testing tubs, and Ferrari hasn’t put a number on how many it’ll sell. Expect lots of vetting though, the 499P Modificata – although not intended for competition – still uses technology from the race car, and Ferrari will be keen for it to remain a secret.

425,Does it work? Tesla's stalk-free drive controls tested,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/does-it-work-tesla-s-stalk-free-interior/,Colin Overland,2024-05-09,Car Magazine UK,"Tesla’s slightly baffling war against the familiar details of the traditional car continues. Speedos, handbrakes, mirror adjusters – all long gone from the physical realm. Now they’re joined by the stalks that used to project from the steering column of and the . One stalk would operate the indicators. That’s now done by a pair of buttons for your left thumb. The top one is for turning left, the bottom one for turning right. Fiddly if you haven’t indicated before you start twirling the wheel, but you get used to it. But losing the other stalk is a bigger deal. That one used to be the drive selector. Like many an automatic, EV or otherwise, it gave a simple choice: R, N or D (or press it in for P), and you could operate it without looking. The new system makes gear engagement yet another touchscreen function. You touch the brake pedal and a slider appears on the edge of the screen. P at the top is for Park. Slide your finger up for Drive. Slide it down for Reverse. There’s no specific N for neutral. In our time with the latest Model 3, the new system worked just as it was intended to, with none of the screen freezes or crashes you’d fear. The problem is that you have to look at the screen to be sure you’re swiping the right bit and that it’s done what you want. Would you ever get to the stage where you’d swipe without looking? I suspect not. It makes three-point turns slower and more irksome than a conventional eyes-off gear selector, which has to be a bad thing. Above your head is the fallback position, in the form of physical buttons for PRND. These would be even slower if you tried to use them as an alternative to the screen – they really are only there for emergencies. The potentially most interesting bit currently has Beta status, ie it’s still being perfected. When you opt in to ‘Auto Shift out of Park’, as it’s clumsily but accurately called, you can change gear without using either the screen or the buttons. More precisely, the car does it for you. Based on sensor data and your previous manoeuvres, it makes an educated guess about what you want to do next. If, for instance, there’s a wall behind you, it knows you’ll want to go forwards, not back. If it’s correct – OMG THE CAR IS READING MY MIND – you just press the accelerator and go forwards. If it’s wrong, you tap the brake pedal and over-ride its gear selection. When you put your foot on the brake pedal, the right-hand edge of the screen becomes a slider that performs the functions of the old gear-selector stalk. You can opt to go further and bypass the swipe. Instead, the car calculates whether your next move will be fore or aft, and you just need to use the pedals. If the screen packs up, there’s a fallback. In the roof, either side of the switch for the hazard warning lights, are manual buttons for P, N, D and R. No. Or rather, it successfully does the job of replacing a stalk with a swipe, but that’s a bad idea as it will mean more time with eyes off the road, which must be a backward step for safety.

426,Seven 485 Final Edition signals end of the line for Europe’s fastest Caterham,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/caterham/seven-485-final-edition-for-europe/,CJ Hubbard,2024-05-09,Car Magazine UK,"The 485 is the fastest model the firm has ever offered in Europe – and if you’re on the Continent you’re now running out of time to buy one. The arrival of a limited Final Edition for both the standard 485 and the 485 CSR marks the end of the road for this 8500rpm Duratec-powered howler. Just 85 examples will be built, split between 60 regular 485 FE and 35 485 CSR FE. The 2.0-litre non-turbo Ford motor under that classic bonnet produces 225bhp and 151lb ft – which is certainly enough to wake you up in the morning given it’s installed in a device that weighs as little as 560kg, is rather short on modern safety features and a similar shape to a coffin. For what it’s worth – and it’ll feel faster, anyway – the official 0-62mph time is 4.1 seconds. Top speed is 139mph. Sports Hex Black interior with leather and Alcantara, Final Edition embroidery, carbon dashboard and full carpeting. Plus satin black Final Edition stripes, black badges and a numbered plaque. Buyers can choose from five standard colours, or go custom. The regular 485 is available in standard and large chassis configurations, while the CSR upgrade – which already features in-board front suspension and a host of other improvements – comes in large only. It also weighs a little more at 605kg but makes up for that with improved rigidity and other performance enhancements. Prices start at 67,495 Euros – before VAT and local taxes. Not cheap, but you’ll be getting one of the most visceral driving experiences around, while it’s still available. And as such, a piece of Caterham history. ‘It’s been an incredible decade for the 485,’ says Caterham European territory manager, Olivier Jouanne, ‘which was an incredibly popular product in Europe, in particular, our DACH markets. For now, we are looking ahead to the additional production and engineering capacity, that will give us the space to focus on expanding our European product offering.’ That’s not a specific mention of electric power, but the concept has shown the company is at least doing some exploration in that direction. Other petrol engines will continue to be available to European customers.

427,A bright idea: uni students build solar-powered car and they’ve just driven it 1863 miles across Australia,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/durham-university-students-build-ortus-t-solar-powered-electric-car/,Tim Pollard,2024-05-10,Car Magazine UK,"Most students eye up cars that are cheap to insure, easy to pack their belongings into at the start of term and have at least some roadside cool. A bunch of Durham University undergraduates have set their sights a little higher: they’re building a solar-powered car capable of driving thousands of miles using energy generated from the sun. The 21-strong group of undergraduates and postgrads recently drove their first effort, the DUSC2023 three-wheeler, 3000km (1863 miles) across Australia in six days as part of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge. The solar-powered car harvests its energy from the sun and is capable of speeds of up to 37mph. Now they’re developing a next-gen solar-powered car: the four-wheeled Ortus-T pictured, which is destined to compete in the iLumen European Solar Challenge (iESC) in September 2024, a 24-hour endurance race at the Zolder circuit in Belgium. And before you ask, it’s a race that allows two charging stops to allow running at night where 20kg batteries provide night-time energy. A handful of brave start-ups are attempting to productionise solar cars: read more about the and in our separate tech explainers. As well as larger 4sq m solar panels with a new chemistry, the students’ 2024 Ortus-T solar-powered car is packaged for a smaller driver to save weight and improve the aerodynamics further. Vedika Bedi, Durham University Solar Car Team Principal (above), said: ‘It’s a tighter squeeze to get behind the wheel, as it’s designed for a 5ft 5in driver, rather than a 6ft 4in person when we were in Australia.’ Ortus-T is fitted with Bridgestone’s low-rolling resistance Enliten tyres, which use 63% recycled materials including organic fibres, recovered carbon black from road car tyres and second-life steel reinforcement. They’re specifically designed to improve range and efficiency of electric cars. The Ortus-T will make its debut at the 2024 , where it will zip silently up the hillclimb.

428,Alpine Alpenglow Hy4 prototype: a hydrogen-powered hypercar that actually works,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/alpenglow-h4/,CJ Hubbard,2024-05-10,Car Magazine UK,"The Alpine Alpenglow Hy4 may sound like some kind of high-fibre alternative to Ready Brek but it might just be the saviour of motorsport as we know it. This is a ‘rolling lab’ prototype for a that Alpine says is ‘like a reference to a future ’ and hints at the brand’s future ‘stylistic evolutions’. Presented as an alternative way of making motorsport sustainable, it uses hydrogen not in a but to power a combustion engine – in this instance a modified four-cylinder unit, hence the ‘Hydrogen four’ retraction that makes up its name. Well, the of 2022 was just that – a concept. The 2024 Alpenglow H4, however, is a fully functional test bed that will make its dynamic debut at the 6-Hours of Spa-Francorchamps endurance race on 11 May, with more demonstration runs to follow at the 2024 24-Hours of Le Mans in June. As such, not only has the visual look of the car changed a bit, it now features a proper two-seater cockpit and a steering wheel. More importantly, there’s also a 2.0-litre turbo engine in the back that burns hydrogen instead of petrol to produce 335bhp. This is a development of an existing engine, but later in 2024 there will be a third Alpenglow variant powered by a bespoke hydrogen V6. Presumably this one will be the Alpenglow Hy6. If you – and this is a slight correction over the original version of this story – it doesn’t create any CO2, though it does generate heat which generates NOx (although suggests there’s less of this than may have originally been thought). This makes hydrogen engines a very low-carbon form of motivation compared with conventional ICE, but one that still delivers the sound and the fury that has thrilled motorsport fans for more than a century. Perhaps making it a more acceptable solution than the digital whine of pure electric racing. ‘As part of our active participation in decarbonising motorsports,’ says Alpine Motorsports’ vice president, Bruno Famin, ‘we see the hydrogen internal combustion engine as an extremely promising solution. We know that hydrogen will be an essential step in decarbonising the next generations of Endurance cars, and could also be for Formula 1 cars, particularly by switching to liquid storage for greater compactness and performance.’ He continues: ‘The Alpenglow prototype perfectly illustrates this, a genuine technological laboratory for developing tomorrow’s hydrogen engines.’ We don’t think so – and Alpine isn’t the only brand experimenting with this approach. Toyota, for example, has been competing in various forms of motorsport with hydrogen combustion engines for a few years now. The most notably example is a GR Corolla H2, which during a season of racing in the 2022 Super Taikyu Japanese endurance series saw significant improvements in performance and practicality – power rose 24 per cent, torque 33 per cent and range increased by 30 per cent, while refuelling time was cut from two minutes to 90 seconds. Toyota also has its own hydrogen hypercar concept, the , revealed in 2023. Both Alpine and Toyota are responding to the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (the ACO – the organisation that runs the Le Mans 24 Hours), which has already announced that it will allow hydrogen-engined cars to compete alongside hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in a special category in the future. The plan to implement this has already been delayed a year – from 2026 to 2027 – so don’t expect EVs to start going out of fashion any time soon, even if the hydrogen technology in these racing cars can be made applicable to affordable road-going machines.

429,Morgan’s limited-run Midsummer is a Pininfarina-designed classic,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/morgan/midsummer/,Jake Groves,2024-05-16,Car Magazine UK,"Morgan has paired up with design house Pininfarina to create the Midsummer – a two-seat ‘barchetta’ model that’s designed to be ‘a celebration of coachbuilding.’ The Midsummer’s sleek, swooping bodywork is made of hand-shaped aluminium to create a smoother and more aerodynamic car that’s still distinctively a Morgan. The brand says each car’s body panels take 250 hours to create. Pininfarina and Morgan designers have injected the Midsummer with much more modern design details, including almost monobloc-like forged 19-inch wheels and much more contemporary lights front and rear. That said, the Midsummer’s extended tail is meant to be a nod to Pininfarina designs of the 1930s and 1940s. Inside, the Midsummer liberally uses exposed wood to furnish the car’s structure, incorporating nine hand-hewn sections of teak. Morgan says it has wanted to make more of a song and dance about the use of wood in the Midsummer as, usually, the material ‘has remained exclusively within the body frame of each vehicle, meaning it’s always been hidden from view.’ Elsewhere inside, the Midsummer benefits from bespoke-design dials and details including a forged aluminium steering wheel and a Sennheiser audio system. The base structure of the Midsummer is a , meaning there’s a potent 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six under the bonnet mated to an eight-speed auto – both originally derived from BMW.

A passing resemblance to the Jawa’s Sandcrawler from is thrown in for free. The CyberTrailer is armed to the teeth with tech and engineering, aiming to provide the wealthy (or , or ) owner the ultimate in off-grid living. Living Vehicle says the CyberTrailer is ‘a testament to sustainability and self-sufficiency.’ Living Vehicle’s promotion of the CyberTrailer is awash with buzzwords and hyperbole, pointing out that it can act as a mobile charging station for your electric truck (as well as being able to power all manner of things inside) using solar panels and backup power generators. Thirsty? Your water needs are taken care of via a water generation system that ‘extracts moisture from the air,’ and is combined with a system that can recycle water from, er, other sources. The aim is for those who own a CyberTrailer to experience the great outdoors ‘without leaving a trace.’ Images are scant (and laughably dark, where we’ve had to brighten them up before publishing), and we have no preview of the CyberTrailer’s interior, but Living Vehicle promises a luxury experience inside.

431,CEO Ingenlath on Polestar's future: 'the plan was always for Volvo to let go',https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/polestar/thomas-ingenlath/,Ben Miller,2024-05-17,Car Magazine UK,"This has to be Polestar’s year. Created in 2017, listed in 2022 and with just 55,000 cars delivered in 2023, ‘the European Tesla’ has so far struggled to emulate the sales or stock-market successes of its Californian rival. Its share value spent most of last year heading in the wrong direction and in February this year, Volvo – the company that created Polestar in a joint venture with Geely – announced it would cease funding and look to reduce its stake, handing the reins to Geely. Volvo’s news prompted a slew of negative headlines. But a little over a month on, Ingenlath – the designer (Audi, VW, Skoda, Volvo) turned CEO – has been through the pain and come out the other side. ‘It was always clear the money we needed should not come out of the pockets of our owners,’ he explains. ‘We had to find financing that wasn’t simply going to Volvo and Geely saying, “Mummy, Daddy, we need more money”. That was always the point, and we talked about the financing and equity required to cover this $1.3bn. At the end of 2023 we were well progressed but we couldn’t at that stage say more. Then of course, when we were finally able to announce we’d raised $950m [from 12 international banks, announced in late February] it was two weeks too late to counterstrike the headlines that came when Volvo announced they would reduce ownership, and everybody thought like, “Oh, this is a big crisis situation!” For us it was a non-dramatic situation. ‘The plan was always for Volvo to let off ownership. And it will still be the partner with whom we need synergies with manufacturing, the service network and so on. That was the original idea. But it was a little bit more of a surprise when it finally happened.’ Ingenlath points out that Polestar has long been developing cars outside Volvo’s sphere of direct influence. The , based on the same CMA platform as the XC40, has a good deal of Volvo DNA, as does . But is much more Geely, and (a Porsche Taycan rival) and (roadster) use Polestar’s own bonded aluminium chassis technology. ‘In Geely we will have different owners of course, and that’s a good thing,’ says Ingenlath. ‘We needed a bigger free float, and this is something that is changing as we grow up as a company and develop cars not only with Volvo. ‘This has been happening for a while – looking into the group and thinking about the tech that’s there. This toolbox; this is something that has happened before and that’s alive today. And let’s face it, the tech that is developed in the Geely group is very interesting. A lot of good things are happening in China in terms of technology.’ But with other Geely brands like Lotus, Volvo and Zeekr all eyeing the same technology, isn’t there a risk of homogeneity? ‘You don’t become a great chef because you found that one vegetable nobody else is using,’ counters Ingenlath. ‘It’s how you cook the meal. Everybody’s cooking with meat, pasta and vegetables. It is not about what ingredients you put in there. It’s what you make out of them. Volvo has something very outstanding with the EX90. But, I mean, if you don’t see the difference between the EX90 and the Polestar 3 then I don’t know what more we can do.’ A key Polestar differentiator, at least in the minds of those who engineer its cars and own them, is an engaging, rewarding driving experience, even if the brand’s beautifully clean, tech-heavy marketing is often light on the thrill of driving. Ingenlath: ‘Our segment is very premium, expensive cars, and that’s where we want to convince. We are definitely not just building computers on wheels. We are building cars that are amazing to drive. We acknowledge that driving can be a very physical, emotional experience, and it needs a lot of craftsmanship and knowledge to tune these cars so that they are not just a piece of software but actually a really nicely performing physical thing.’ The 5 and 6 will play important roles as performance flagships when they finally arrive. But that’s in the future. Ingenlath knows that, after years of development and hefty spending, it’s right now that matters. ‘As a company we have been planning for a long time,’ he says. ‘But it is important to be really alert for the right now. We cannot fail in launching the 3 and 4 in a successful way.’ As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy. One of the team who's just as happy on two wheels as four."

They stated that it was illegal for a car built in Poland to bear the name of Italy’s second city, as the badge risked misleading consumers about the car’s origins. Now, Fiat has been beaten with the same piece of legislation. The Italian government has impounded a shipment of at the port of Livigno, simply because they wear small Italian flag badges on their doors. Officials say that makes the cars illegal to sell in Italy because they were assembled in Morocco. Fiat has said it will remove the badges from the cars to make them compliant with the legislation. However, the carmaker also justified its actions by reminding officials that the Topolino was penned in its design centre in Turin – so, Fiat believes the car is an honest product of Italian workmanship. In an official statement, Fiat denied any deliberate wrongdoing saying: ‘Fiat has always been clear in its communication about the country of production. We believe that we have operated in full compliance with the regulations, transparently communicating the country of production of the Topolino, without any deceptive intent towards consumers.’ The so-called Made in Italy law is a piece of legislation designed to prevent fraudulent ‘Italian sounding’ goods from entering the market. One of the main reasons for the law’s existence was the booming global trade of forged (and poorer quality) Italian foodstuffs. A simple example of the law in action is Prosecco. For a sparkling wine to be legitimately called Prosecco, it must have been grown, produced and packaged in north-east Italy, in the regions of Veneto or Friuli Venezia Giulia using the Prosecco grape.

433,CLEAR! The Renault U1st concept is Grey's Anatomy on wheels,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/u1st-concept/,Ted Welford,2024-05-22,Car Magazine UK,"Tired of waiting two months for a GP appointment or frantically dialling the doctors at 8am? Renault may have the answer with its U1st Vision concept – a van that can serve as a mobile dentist, GP and even an optician. Developed by Software Republique, a network of French companies that work to provide ‘tomorrow’s mobility’ – including Renault, digital services provider Orange and media firm JCDecaux, the U1st Vision is its latest creation. The van is based around Renault’s new ‘FlexE’ platform and can use a range of different ‘pop-up’ modules for a range of different services, with its medical surgery use the first to be showcased. It’s been revealed at VivaFest, a huge start-up tech expo in Paris, of which boss Elon Musk is even a guest speaker at. It’s a big deal. Good question, and one that’s quite hard to answer. Unlike a usual new car reveal where you know most of the details before you see it, the U1st was different – we truly walked int a dark room with no idea what to expect. When the covers were pulled off, a van was certainly not expected, and neither was the fact it’s essentially a GP surgery on wheels. Software Republique has worked with more than 20 companies, many involved with healthcare, to create the U1st concept, and it’s said to boast 12 world-first innovations. It features a range of scanners and tests to assess a person to pick up any health problems as early as possible. Integrating with data from your personal devices – such as the steps tracked with your watch – it is said to be able to handle 85 per cent of regular medical tests, including blood pressure monitoring, ultrasound, hearing tests and even giving your teeth a once-over. In car language, think it of as a 114-point inspection. Renault is putting a big focus on saying this concept is scalable and modular, with healthcare just one ‘pop-up’ use possible from the van. Other examples it gives include having it as a remote office or tech support, a mobile bike repair outlet or for electrical goods recycling. However, rather than being an autonomous pod that goes around scanning people and telling them their ailments, it’s said to be ‘human-first’. Tests are completed by a medical expert in person but can be done remotely through the help of an AI assistant, the firm says. While a mobile medical surgery is a great idea, there is the question of why this is only a concept vehicle given plenty of expert conversion companies already modify vehicles in a similar sort of way – ambulances being the most obvious example. fBut by bringing a range of companies together, Renault is at an obvious advantage, not least by selling its conversion-ready vans to these firms. Renault says it’s in ‘discussion with customers’ to make the real deal based on its . The concept is also expected to be trialled with a range of healthcare companies.

434,Jeep’s cutesy Avenger toughens up with new 4xe version,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jeep/avenger-4xe/,Jake Groves,2024-05-22,Car Magazine UK,"Could this be a Panda 4×4 for the 2020s? Jeep has unveiled its tougher and more capable Avenger 4xe model, after managing to squeeze in the brand’s four-wheel drive system into the baby SUV’s architecture. Naturally, right at the heart of this new 4×4 is its new drivetrain. The Avenger 4xe uses a 1.2-litre petrol engine developing 134bhp, with the combustion engine mated to two 21kW (28bhp) e-motors – one for each axle – technically meaning the 4xe’s system is an electric all-wheel drive configuration, as only the rear e-motor drives the rear wheels. Performance-wise, the Avenger 4xe is capable of a 9.6sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 120mph. The baby 4×4 uses a six-speed dual-clutch transmission, and also features an e-boost function for a temporary kick of extra power. The four-wheel drive system splits power 50:50 under 19mph, with the rear axle only activating on demand with speeds between 19 and 56mph. Anything higher than that and the 4xe remains front-wheel drive. Jeep says was crafted from the start to be the toughest model using the Stellantis CMP platform, but this new 4xe model is 10mm higher off the ground and can wade in up to 400mm of water – reasonable for a baby 4×4. For reference, can wade in 530mm, while the mammoth can tackle 900mm. New multi-link rear suspension features, replacing the torsion beam at the rear for so many other cars that run on the CMP architecture. And that raised ride height means improved approach, breakover and departure angles. The new Avenger 4xe arrives with some bonus exterior and interior design details to set it apart. Flecks of green feature on the exterior – a departure from the usual blue seen on other 4xe models – and roof racks are standard. Avenger 4xe models are fitted with mud and snow-ready tyres as standard, with all-terrain rubber an option. Optional decals can be specced. Little has changed inside, but 4xe models feature seats upholstered with a waterproof material. Jeep has confirmed that the Avenger 4xe will join the UK line-up, with orders starting towards the end of 2024. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

435,New Nissan Qashqai prices revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/qashqai/,Seth Walton,2024-05-24,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan has unveiled the price list for its upcoming facelift Qashqai. The hotly anticipated revamp of Britain’s former best-selling car goes into production this year, giving the internal combustion Qashqai one last hurrah before going fully electric as part of Nissan’s EV36Zero plan later on in the decade. But back to the pricing. The Qashqai will start from £30,135 in its most basic trim grade – Acenta Premium. Still, for your money you get a large 12.3-inch infotainment display along with a handful of other fresh materials around the cabin. Moving up the range, N-Connecta will cost £32,305 while an all new trim called N-Design is set at £34,845. In this trim grade, the Qashqai features body-coloured lower door areas and wheel arches, while new 20” alloy wheels are also thrown in. A smattering of Alcantara is also included in the N-Design package, as it is on the range-topping Tekna+ trim for £38,875. Starting from just over 30 grand, the new Qashqai has a cheaper base price than its rival – the Ford Kuga, but it’s more expensive than some other models in the class. For example, the Skoda Karoq starts from £29,575 while a base-spec Kia Sportage will set you back £29,390. In Acenta Premium spec, the new Qashqai is slightly cheaper than the least expensive of the outgoing model you can buy right now (it’s currently listed at £31,905 for an N-Connecta model) but Tekna+ is getting a bump up from its current price of £37,955 to £38,875. See below for more information on the upcoming 2024 Nissan Qashqai. Though Nissan’s all-electric future may be in sight, it isn’t quite finished with the current crop just yet. Meet the new Qashqai – an evolution of the latest third-generation model, it’s received a few touch-ups for 2024 to strengthen Nissan’s already firm grip on the compact crossover segment before a full transition to the plug. That’s right, a fully electric Qashqai is on the way. It’ll be produced at the Nissan Plant in Sunderland alongside electrified versions of the JUKE and the LEAF, forming part of Nissan’s EV36ZERO future. But back to the here and now. Read on to find out how Nissan’s changed and updated the Qashqai, including which new driver aids, safety systems and other tech will be available on the model. Nissan’s revisited the Qashqai’s front end, updating the front grille with a pattern of myriad high-gloss, comma-like shapes to emulate the patterns of ancient Japanese armour scales. There are now more body-coloured panels, including the flanks of the bumpers and, as part of a new N-Design trim grade, the wheel arches. N-Design also includes 20” alloy wheels to complete a bolder look. The Qashqai’s headlights also have received the update treatment. They now feature an adaptive high beam module to improve visibility in low-light conditions, along with new daytime running lights, shaped to match the commas of the grille. Depending on the trim grade, sequential indicator lights are also now available on the Qashqai for the first time. Around the back, it’s much the same story. The rear lights have been redesigned to include lighting elements shaped in the style of the grille commas, while the bumper has been reshaped to match the more striking aesthetic of the car. It’s available in gloss black or in N-Design grade, you guessed it – body-colour. Along with the revisited shape design, a handful of new paint colours are also now available on the Qashqai. They include a softer, cleaner Pearl White, a more ominous Pearl Black and, supposedly, a more thought-provoking Deep Blue. Customers who select one of the upper levels of the Qashqai trim range will receive a pasting of Alcantara around their cabin. On all models, there are now new materials on show, particularly in the fit and finish around the centre console. There’s a fully customisable TFT screen on offer, plus a head-up display – one that’s projected onto the windscreen. And of course there’s a new 9-inch infotainment system with a list of services as long as your arm, but more on them later. There are refreshed seat trims on offer including a partially quilted design, though Nissan seemed most enthused by the introduction of adaptive ambient lighting around the cabin. ‘Up to 64 colour choices’ we heard, the team beaming. The new Qashqai has received a significant provision of new tech and driving aids, too. They include an upgraded version of Nissan’s Around View Monitor system with a new 3D function. It allows drivers to monitor the car from eight different angles – the front of the car, from the rear, the sides and the corners – as well as from the top down. This newly integrated system can also improve vehicle safety when exiting one road onto another with poor visibility. It’ll even save where the location of the potentially dangerous spot is then reactivate when you get close to it again. In conjunction with the newly uprated AVM system, the new Qashqai can also be spec’d with what Nissan is calling ‘Harry Potter Mode’. No, you did indeed read that correctly. Invisible hood view or ‘Harry Potter Mode’ removes the body of the car from the monitoring feed, leaving only the wheels in view on the display. The idea is that without the body of the car obstructing your view of the wheels, it should be easier to keep track of where they are relative to nearby hazards like high curbs. No more chipping alloys when parallel parking or flying around the corners of multi-storey car parks. The 2024 Qashqai comes with several Google services integrated into the car’s infotainment suite – the first car in Nissan’s European range to do so. Included in the package is an integrated Google Maps app, a voice-activated Google Assistant that can control several functions in the car including the heated seats and ventilation, and access to Google Play. Via the latter, apps can be downloaded onto the car’s infotainment software itself, rather than hooking up a smartphone as would be the case for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. An updated version of Nissan Connected Services will also keep an eye on your car for you, notifying you if you forget to lock your doors or close all your windows, or if your car is being tampered with. You can even now carry out the first two functions from your smartphone for even greater convenience. No, Nissan has left the core setup of the car alone, focussing instead on the Qashqai’s safety, connectivity and the quality of its design. ‘That’s where we know our customers’ priories lie,’ Clíodhna Lyons explained, regional Vice President of Product & Services Planning. ‘That’s where we know the compact crossover segment is extremely competitive and so that’s where we’ve kept our focus – to remain the leader of the pack in that segment.’ So, Nissan is sticking with the same 1.3-litre mild-hybrid and a range extender, 1.5-litre hybrid known as E-power. This drivetrain comes in five flavours, as listed below, the most powerful version also being available with a more ‘intuitive and intelligent’ four-wheel-drive system that has five driving modes. It’s also claimed to shuffle torque split more effectively, redistributing power to the rear wheels up to five times quicker than the previous set-up.

436,A return to elegance? BMW Concept Skytop bows in at Villa d'Este 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/concept-skytop/,Tim Pollard,2024-05-25,Car Magazine UK,"In keeping with longstanding tradition, BMW has revealed a dramatic, swooping concept car at the Villa d’Este concours show at Lake Como this weekend: meet the new 2024 BMW Concept Skytop – an achingly hip, and remarkably production-ready, new large two-seat roadster. Remind you of anything? To these eyes, there are signals this could herald the return to a luxury GT convertible in the mould of the fêted BMW Z8 of the late Nineties and, word is, Munich is working on just such a launch for the middle of the decade. This might help explain why the Skytop looks remarkably production-ready. It’s a targa-top two-seater and can be seen as an olive branch to those who decry how many modern BMWs continue to stretch the aesthetic palate; this is easier to decode, with traditional BMW design cues, a more elegant profile and – glory be – a good old-fashioned V8 powertrain. ‘The BMW Concept Skytop is a truly unique and exotic design, in the tradition of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este,’ said Adrian van Hooydonk, head of BMW Group Design. ‘It offers a combination of driving dynamics and elegance at the highest level, comparable to its historic ancestors, like the BMW Z8 or BMW 503.’ Note the spline that runs the full length of the bonnet, through the cabin and exits at the rear, courtesy of an aluminium trim finisher on the bootlid. It’s a clear reference to the Z8 of yesteryear, according to its designers. There’s also the trad BMW shark-nose front end, angled for a degree of visual menace, while there’s no messing with the familiar twin-kidney grille. The electro brigade had to meddle a little here though; they are illuminated for extra streetside swagger, obvs. Check out the new interpretation of the Hofmeister kink on the side window graphic (no easy feat on an open-top car). Note how the door handles are integrated into ‘winglets’ atop the shoulders of the car, leaving the flanks clear of visual interruption. The very latest slimline LEDs mean the light graphics are super-thin front and rear. If you hear the Skytop in action at Villa d’Este you’ll be left in no doubt of its V8 powertrain. This is technically a design study, in line with BMW’s long history of showing cars at the upmarket event on the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy, so there’s precious little talk of platforms or tech. ‘There are also similarities in engine variants with the BMW Z8,’ says BMW. ‘Like the legendary roadster, the BMW Concept Skytop also comes with the most powerful V8 engine in the BMW drivetrain portfolio.’ Gets our vote of approval. This is a targa top, lined in leather, with a similarly hide-clad rollover bar behind the two front seats. If you want to go , you pull over, remove the roof parts and stow them in a compartment in the boot. The rear window retracts out of sight electrically. The leather seats have been made with a delicate handstitched brogue-style finish and there are crystal accents throughout the snug roadster cabin. The colour scheme is decidedly brown, with coppery red-brown roof and interior hues contrasting with the muted silver paint and brightwork. Thoughts on the 2024 BMW Concept Skytop?

437,Lancia shows first images of new hot Ypsilon HF,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lancia/ypsilon-hf/,Jake Groves,2024-05-28,Car Magazine UK,"Lancia has revealed the first pictures and details for its new hotter Ypsilon HF supermini model. The new hot(ish) electric hatch has been revealed alongside the brand’s announcement that it is officially returning to rallying. Brand boss Luca Napolitano says that, with the launch of the new Ypsilon HF, that Lancia’s ‘sporty heart is starting to beat again.’ Only a few performance specs have been announced, with the Ypsilon HF featuring a single e-motor that develops 237bhp – that’s good for a 0-62mph sprint in 5.8 seconds. Lancia says the HF model also features a widened track and lower suspension than a standard Ypsilon. Design details include sharp-looking and blocky wheels and a smattering of black trimmings around the wheelarches and front end. The oval slots in the grille on the standard car have been removed for something a little more aggressive, too. The new Ypsilon HF will launch in Continental Europe in May 2025 but, like the regular model, there’s no confirmation it will come to the UK. As well as revealing this Ypsilon HF model, Lancia has confirmed that its forthcoming Gamma and Delta models will also benefit from a HF model.

438,Lancia returns to rallying with the Ypsilon HF,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lancia/rally-return/,Graham King,2024-05-28,Car Magazine UK,"Lancia is set to return to the world’s rally stages with this, the Ypsilon Rally4 HF. It’s the first factory-built Lancia rally car in more than 30 years and revives the brand’s iconic Martini livery – at least in these images. Lancia is one of the most legendary names in rallying history and it remains the most successful, winning 15 manufacturers’ titles in the World Rally Championship. That’s despite the Italian marque not fielding a factory team in more than 30 years. Sadly, the Ypsilon Rally4 HF doesn’t mark a return to front-line WRC competition. Instead, it’s aimed at young, up and coming drivers competing in national and regional series, including the European Rally Championship. Unlike the road-going , the Rally4 HF is powered by a heavily tuned 1.2-litre, three-cylinder turbocharged engine producing 209bhp. The power is sent to the front wheels via a five-speed sequential gearbox and a mechanical limited-slip differential. It’s a proven mechanical package that the Ypsilon shares with the Rally4-spec Peugeot 208 and Vauxhall/Opel Corsa – all three cars are built on the Stellantis CMP platform – so any competitors taking a punt on the Lancia will be pretty confident in its reliability. It’s an incredibly successful package, as well, the Peugeot in particular racking up countless class wins and championships. Rally 4 is the second tier on the FIA’s current rally specification ‘pyramid’, which is based on the cars’ power-to-weight ratio. The Rally1 cars competing in the WRC are at the top with a ratio of 3.1 kilos-per-horsepower; Rally4 cars have 5.1 kg/hp. Lancia has yet to set out a timeframe for when the Ypsilon Rally4 HF will reach stages but expect to see it at some point in 2025 when the road car arrives. Prices haven’t been divulged either but, for reference, a Peugeot 208 Rally4 carries a base price of €73000 (£62000) plus local taxes.

439,Petrol Volkswagen Golf GTI will persist from '2028 onwards',https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/petrol-powered-golf-gti-will-survive-beyond-2028/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-05-28,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen’s approach to electrification is a little more conservative than its competitors. Fiat is calling time on its petrol-powered cars in 2030, while . But Volkswagen? It’s planning to cling to combustion power until 2033. That’s a smart move because, even by the time 2030 rolls around, we doubt there’ll have been enough and significant enough improvements in battery technology to make as convenient to own as petrol cars. At least at the price point mainstream brands such as Fiat, Vauxhall and Volkswagen are targeting. This is good news for enthusiasts, because it means Volkswagen has an excuse to keep the petrol-powered alive for longer – and, after speaking with Michael Blaul, Volkswagen’s product marketing manager, at an event in Berlin earlier this month, CAR magazine has learned that’s exactly what the firm intends to do. He told us: ‘If you want to buy a GTI in the future, with the petrol engine, you will be able also 2028 onwards. We know things much better after the European election. But until this point of time, the Golf will survive a few years. So, until 2030-something, we will see a Golf on the street.’ That remains closely guarded secret. However, CAR magazine understands there are two options on Volkswagen’s table – work with what it already has or create something fresh. To us, the most tactical solution would be to extend the current Golf’s life cycle into the 2030s, potentially giving the car a second facelift in 2028 to create a Mk8.75 model that can tide the brand over until it needs to go all electric. When pressed for comment, Blaul said: ‘that could be a possible solution, yes. ‘That’s very strategic and, me as a product marketing manager, I’m fighting for it of course. But the head of the whole company, who are managers, who try to focus differently. So, it’s hard times for us I would say.’ To lend further credence to the theory, we asked Blaul whether the current Golf could be made Euro 7 compliant. He replied with: ‘yes, and we will also achieve the targets with our normal Golf model. But the sporty versions could be – we’d have to decide where to focus on. I would say the GTI will survive as well.’ The second option is that the will be available with both petrol and electric power. However, this seems much less likely considering Volkswagen has already confirmed the car will be based on the Group’s electric-only SSP architecture. The only way Volkswagen could make this second scenario work would be to adopt the same approach . There’s an electric and a petrol-powered version of that car. The electric model is based on all-new, pure-electric underpinnings, while the petrol version is essentially a heavily updated version of the previous car – but you’d struggle to tell them apart if you weren’t in the know. To the untrained eye, the two cars look very similar. The petrol model has the same bang up-to-date infotainment system as the electric car and its body has been cleverly styled to look like the EV. Compare the two cars side-by-side, though, and you’ll see they have completely different windscreen rakes, and they aren’t even the same size. Volkswagen could adopt the same strategy by pinching Audi’s Premium Platform Combustion architecture (which will be used under the next-generation A5 coupe and Q5 SUV) and building the petrol Mk9 Golf on that. However, the only sticking point we see is that the chassis might make the car a little too expensive to be profitable. There will be sacrifices. Euro 7 emissions regulations and legislation such as the UK’s will gradually push the worst-performing cars out to pasture. For example, Volkswagen is much less precious about keeping the around – and the second it starts costing money in fines, the company won’t hesitate to swing the axe. When quizzed on whether we can expect another evolution of the petrol Polo, Blaul said: ‘as far as I know, I guess the ID.2 will be a lot of things customers expect from an electric Polo. The problem is, to bring the Euro 7 to the end of the petrol or gasoline engines, that Euro 7 will be so expensive for the whole cars that it’s impossible to stay with the Polo and all those cars below the Golf. ‘Probably in a few years, the Golf will be the entry in a gasoline engine in the Volkswagen world. That could be a scenario which could be a reality. ‘It’s also difficult to manage so many different types of engines over the years from an investment perspective. So, you cannot do so many different things in parallel. You have to decide which way you want to go – and our strategic position in the past was we go the electric way.’ We’ll keep you updated on how the process plays out. For now, take comfort in the fact that, if you’re a petrolhead fretting about the crushing dominance of EV legislation, you’ll still be able to get your fix from Volkswagen for the next few years.

441,Volkswagen R to launch its first electric car by 2029,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/r-division-to-launch-first-ev-by-2029/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-05-29,Car Magazine UK,"Reinhold Ivenz, boss of Volkswagen’s R division, has confirmed the brand will break into the market within the next five years. We suspect the first electric car to wear R badging will be the , the standard version of which is expected to be unveiled in 2029. During a roundtable interview, Ivenz told CAR magazine: ‘the future for us will be electric. It makes sense for us. In the moment, we look about the concepts – but for us it’s very important that the car is authentic also in the electric world. We will start, and we can say that in the next five years we will launch our first electric car.’ Despite his rather strict deadline, Reinhold also said he wouldn’t rush the R division into the EV market if the car produced by such a scramble wouldn’t be a true R model. He told us: ‘We say we’ll offer an electric car only if everything is okay for us.’ ‘The acceleration, the performance, the is very important – the dynamic of the car and how it feels, how it looks like. It’s very important for us. So, we had always said in interviews that we will come with an [electric] car if everything is okay for us – and we don’t make an R-powered [electric] car which is not okay for us.’ Reinhold wouldn’t confirm the specifics, although he has ruled out a few ideas. For example, it doesn’t sound like Volkswagen will adopt the same combustion-mimicking approach as the for its electric performance cars. Ivenz told us: ‘It’s a new generation. It makes no sense to copy the combustion engine. But you must find new R items which are very important for us.’ At the moment, the new R items Reinhold’s team seem to be focused on are software-driven features such as lap timers and 0–60mph trackers. In fact, Jonas Thielebein, a development engineer for Volkswagen’s R division, took a rather dim view of Hyundai’s approach. He said: ‘You know how hard decisions are to make now on [gimmicks] like shifting an electric car and mimicking a combustion engine like some competitors. ‘But is it necessary to do this in four to five years? Or is it more to carry the customers over the transition from the combustion to the electric vehicles? Is it really necessary to develop it or does our customers wonder [why we bothered] in four or five years? That’s just one small piece of a big puzzle. It’s hard times, but very interesting times.’ Ivenz also told us there’s no chance that the Volkswagen R division will build its own bespoke model and separate from the Volkswagen brand in the same way . He said it was simply too expensive to either engineer his own platform for the project or try to piggyback development of the car off a more technologically advanced platform from another brand within the Volkswagen Group, such as Porsche. Alright, keep your hair on. There’s a lot to unpack here. The first electric R model will probably be based on the upcoming , which will be underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s new SSP architecture. This fresh platform will be crucial in bringing the R EV to market. Volkswagen’s boss, Thomas Schafer, has previously told us that the Group’s existing MEB architecture can’t provide the level of performance the R division deems acceptable for its cars – and if Ivenz isn’t happy, he’ll dig in his heels like a stubborn husky. Ivenz tells us the R division is already setting out its requirements for the new SSP platform now, even though his electric R car is still five years away. This is different to how performance variants were built when petrol power was the primary focus. In the past, when Volkswagen wanted to make a fast Golf, its engineers simply bolted on some stiffer suspension, bigger brakes and racy seats, then shoehorned a more powerful engine under the car’s bonnet. There was a lot more wriggle room in the development process after the car had left the blueprinting stage. But things are different with electric cars. Everything that might be expected of an electric car during its life cycle must be defined while it’s still on the drawing board because the power of its control modules dictate its capability. These computers run everything on cars now so, if a manufacturer wants to launch a hot version of one of its cars, it’s cheaper and more efficient to design one set of control modules that are flexible enough to allow that in the early stages of the development process rather than having to retrofit them to the platform once the car is on sale. Ivenz explained: ‘Now, you must be a part of the car from the beginning. It is very important. The development of cars in the future will change – and we must say what we want in five years.’ Thielebein chimed in, saying: ‘You don’t need to fix every detail. You don’t need to fix exactly the font or colour or everything like that. But, for example, the performance of the control units need to be big enough for our requirements.’ According to Ivenz, they’re incredibly receptive to the idea of an electric R car. He explained: ‘The customers […] are all interested in electric cars.’ Volkswagen has even surveyed its R drivers – and the results showed that 85 percent could see themselves buying an electric car in the future. Reinhold isn’t mad, though. He knows the financial potential that’s left in his current combustion-engine range – and he isn’t prepared to sacrifice that to the electric era just yet. ‘In the moment,’ he said, ‘[our customers] are confident with the Golf or with T-Roc. So, we will not do something that is wrong for us, and we bring the [electric] car when everything is good for us.’ Let’s see what the next few years bring. We’re curious to learn whether Ivenz’s intel remains accurate when the R division finally makes the switch.

442,BMW's M3 refreshed for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m3/,Jake Groves,2024-05-29,Car Magazine UK,"It’s update time for the BMW M3 and, as well as a visual nip and tuck and some tech upgrades, it also gets a power boost for the Competition models. The 2024 update is mostly blink-and-you’ll miss it, with extremely light design tweaks like new headlights and with fresh wheels that include a larger diameter on the rear. BMW is also keen to point out a load of additional personalisation options. As you can see, though, the mole rat nostrils remain. For the UK market, we still only get the Competition models, which benefit from a small power boost over the pre-facelift. The ‘old’ M3 Competition featured a 503bhp/479lb ft straight-six capable of a 0-62mph sprint time of 3.9 seconds and a performance-tuned version of BMW’s eight-speed auto. The new, 523bhp post-facelift model sprints to 62mph in 3.5sec in saloon form, or 3.6sec in Touring form. As before, the M3 is auto-only in the UK market. ‘This new generation [of M3/M4] will reinvent itself by virtue of the widest range of drivetrain layouts we’ve yet offered in an M3, so that you can fully exploit the vehicle’s potential in all circumstances,’ product management man Hagen Franke. ‘This was the plan from the start,’ affirmed engineer Wolf at the original launch. ‘The M5 is in a torque and horsepower range where you can hardly find any advantages for a rear-wheel-drive version. In the case of the M3 and M4 we are not quite in that range. We see some situations where you might be better off with rear-wheel drive. This makes the choice the M3/M4 customer has now as perfect.’ Borrowing heavily from the M5/M8 system, M’s take on xDrive powers the rear axle alone until traction is compromised. At that point an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer box steps in to optimise the front/rear power split, with the Active M Differential juggling the power left/right on the rear axle. The default mode, 4WD, is fast, grippy and more neutral than Audi’s quattro, on the M5 Competition at least. 4WD Sport is more rear-biased and the pick of the bunch for real-world use, combining any-weather traction with a degree of playfulness, while 2WD opens the door to, as Franke puts it, ‘a lot of fun and a lot of smoke’. Inside, the M3 benefits from a redesigned steering wheel, as well as BMW Operating System version 8.5 (up from the previous car’s 8.0) with refreshed graphics and extra capability. BMW’s updated M3 is on sale now, priced from £82,420 for an M3 Competition xDrive saloon, or £84,700 for an M3 Competition Touring xDrive. Deliveries start in the summer of 2024.

443,BMW 3-series updated again as plug-in hybrid 330e electric range is almost doubled,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/3-series/,CJ Hubbard,2024-05-29,Car Magazine UK,"BMW is starting to seem like one of those over-achieving kids who just can’t sit still if they’re not being challenged by something – just two years after the last significant update to the in 2022, here’s another one for 2024. The only changes on the outside are to paint choices (including new Arctic Race Blue and Fire Red metallics) and alloy wheel designs. But under the skin the super-successful has been upgraded with a new, more energy-dense battery pack. This nearly doubles claimed electric-only driving range to as much as 63 miles per charge. At the same time an 11kW onboard AC charger speeds up recharging, and across the new BMW 3-series line-up you’ll find different cabin materials, redesigned steering wheels and an enhanced infotainment system powered by BMW Operating System 8.5. Alterations to the chassis are said to improve comfort without reducing driver enjoyment. The revised 3-series is available to order as both Saloon and car now. Already a company car star, thanks to its combination of low tax rates and punchy performance, the 2024 BMW 330e is only likely to prove more popular thanks to increased zero emissions driving capability. Cementing its position as one of the (PHEVs) you can buy. It varies with exact model, but previously you were looking at a claimed maximum of 38 miles. Now BMW says it will do up to 63 miles (61 miles for the Touring) before the four-cylinder petrol needs to cut in – a change that’s happened without any further loss of boot space or reduction in fuel-tank capacity. Meaning total driving range should be improved as well. The new 19.5kWh (usable) battery pack uses BMW Gen5 eDrive tech – the same as the iX and other current all-electric BMW flagships, but a generation behind the forthcoming – which means its far more energy dense than before. The addition of a three-phase 11kW AC charger means a full charge from zero can be completed in 2 hours and 15 minutes now. This is the first time such tech has been added to a BMW plug-in hybrid, but still looks a little pathetic versus the DC fast charging available on the (for example). The 330e’s power output remains unchanged at 288bhp, and there are no performance bumps for the rest of the range, either. This means UK buyers continue to have a choice of four-cylinder 181bhp 320i at the entry level and six-cylinder 369bhp M340i xDrive at the top of the tree – with an above this (see our separate story). The M340i is a ; all three petrol engines – including the 330e – feature TwinPower turbocharging and an eight-speed automatic gearbox with paddleshifters. There is no diesel 3-series for UK buyers anymore, and you can’t get a manual gearbox. At least one of those is definitely a shame. Focused on improving comfort – though exactly how significant they will be when most UK buyers opt for M-Sport specification with its specific suspension tuning remains to be seen. However, BMW has confirmed to that the M Sport suspension has received a similar re-emphasis on comfort as well. Some modifications will benefit every 3-series regardless. For instance, the rear damper mounting points are now stiffer, helping to improve damping performance. The development work is said to result in ‘even greater overall precision, composure and controllability’, with refinement also getting a boost as part of the package. One of the most tangible changes should be the lighter steering weight in the Comfort driving mode, since ‘the force needed to turn the steering wheel has been reduced.’ The radical alterations took place in 2022, when the 3-series adopted the BMW Curved Display. For 2024, the firm has some new materials and steering wheels. The most notable material upgrade is the optional ‘CraftedClarity’ glass finish for the iDrive controller, starter button and gear selector, though there are some fabric changes and other enhancements as well. The most notable steering wheel difference comes with the two-spoke items with ‘polygonal rim’ now fitted to Luxury models. M Sport versions get a new design of three-spoke wheel. Elsewhere on the inside the ‘cascade lighting’ that illuminates the dashboard comes in nine ‘colour worlds’ (if you didn’t roll your eyes then we’re impressed) and can be enhanced with an extended dynamic ambient lighting package. Driver preferences will be stored in the BMW ID settings. Once you’ve added the car to the My BMW App you can also do things such as view the vehicle’s immediate surroundings at any time via your smartphone, thanks to the option Remote 3D View function. This has a ‘flatter’ menu structure – meaning less changing screens to achieve something – and QuickSelect controls to make accessing important capabilities more straightforward, thanks to a bar of customisable widgets on the side closest to the driver. However, it’s also not the latest variant, and the and (for example) are now rocking BMW Operating System 9. There’s an dedicated to this stuff if you want to know more. Prices start at £39,045 for the Saloon and £40,845 for the Touring. You can order one now, with UK first deliveries expected in summer 2024.

444,"New, 600bhp electric Wagoneer S is the quickest Jeep ever",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jeep/wagoneer-s/,Jake Groves,2024-05-31,Car Magazine UK,"How does such an old-school brand like Jeep convince more people to go electric? By building its quickest-accelerating car ever. This is the new Wagoneer S, a battery-electric SUV that comes with some eye-watering performance figures and, seemingly, one of the most protracted reveal processes we’ve seen in some time. The Wagoneer S is a sort-of-Velar-sized electric SUV that is designed to impress those in North America as well as convince more Europeans to think Jeep, offering something that can provide a long range, loads of space and still fit on our cosier roads. ‘This will be the first Jeep Wagoneer in Europe, says brand CEO Antonio Filosa, ‘but we thought that, for the streets and configuration of the beautiful European cities, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer we have in North America are too big. We’ve ended up with the perfect fit with the Wagoneer S.’ Jeep is aiming big, riding a nice wave of sales growth in Europe that’s mostly been down to the . Three of Jeep’s biggest markets are in Europe, so it’s hoping the Wagoneer S can crack that more premium end of the electric car market. Yes, let’s do that. Naturally, the most noticeable feature is a rather clever interpretation of Jeep’s ‘seven slot’ grille arrangement seen on every vehicle it’s ever made. Vince Gallante, Jeep’s VP for exterior design, says his team used architectural light to incorporate the motif onto the car’s design. But, save for that, would you know it was a Jeep without it? The Wagoneer S has a very clean and relatively crease-free exterior design, with Gallante pointing out that it’s the most aerodynamic model Jeep has ever created. Part of the car’s silhouette is an enormous rear wing that truly sets the Wagoneer S apart from so many other cars of its size. ‘The first thing we thought to ourselves was that there’s no way the engineering team is going to let us get away with this – no way we’re going to be able to have a floating wing like this,’ says Gallante. ‘But we brought it into the tunnel and it worked so well [for aerodynamic efficiency] that they asked us to increase the size of it three times.’ Inside, there are a lot of design cues taken from the as well as the larger Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models sold in North America. One single beltline spans across the dashboard with no fewer than FOUR possible screens incorporated into it: a driver’s instrument display, main infotainment screen, lower climate display and passenger panel. Gallante brags about the whole Jeep exterior and interior design team are ‘100 per cent Millennial or Gen Z,’ talks about how ‘the gamers in the team are the ones that designed all of the graphics you see on those screens’ and notes that special effort has been made to decontent the driver’s instrument cluster of information. Some attention to detail has been applied inside, with Gallante pointing out that the steering wheel is coated in anti-microbial treatment to help keep your hands clean, and every interior material has a satin finish to help curb fingerprints and smudges. ‘All of the soft materials also have some sort of recycled component in them’ he adds. Gallante also claims that those in the second row have more legroom than in the back of a Grand Cherokee, and the boot area is rated to 866 litres with the rear seats up. Well, before we even saw the car in its physical form at a preview event, Jeep’s team showed the media – the bestselling electric car in America, and one that’s known to not be slow – and beating it in a drag race. That on top of drag racing Jeep’s own, mighty and rather loud . Why? Because the Wagoneer S launches with 600bhp, two electric motors and the possibility of a 3.4sec 0-60mph sprint – a figure that’s quicker than both of those cars. The new Jeep is the second car (the first was the ) to launch using Stellantis’ STLA Large architecture, which is designed for premium and high-performance models. The ‘EV native’ platform can run on either 400 or 800-volt electrical architectures, be had with battery packs between 85 and 118kWh, and is capable of up to 500 miles on a charge. Here, with the Wagoneer S Launch Edition, it’s a 400-volt car with a 100.5kWh pack that claims ‘over’ 300 miles on a single charge. As well as that lightning quick sprint time, the Wagoneer tops out at 124mph. Jeep also says it’s capable of a 20-80 per cent charge in 23 minutes via a DC fast charger. And Filosa, hints that more specifications are on the way. ‘This is the Launch Edition, we will have more [versions] – and the attributes of each of these editions will be different in terms of energy density, range and power. We’ll see the next launches in the next six months or so,’ he tells us. ‘We’ve started with this one, then we’ll have a lower version, and then we’ll complete the line-up with other versions – some that may not be that expected, so stay tuned. First, though, we need to be successful with this one.’ So much so that the brand has already teased a more off-road focused Trailhawk model with a concept car. It launches in the States first towards the end of 2024 with a price of $71,995 for the Launch Edition. The model launches in Europe and the UK, as well as other markets around the world in 2025.

445,RIP Geneva International Motor Show: 2025 edition cancelled and future successor unlikely,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/geneva/geneva-motor-show-preview-a-z-of-all-the-new-cars/,Jake Groves,2024-05-31,Car Magazine UK,"The next Geneva International Motor Show in Switzerland, originally planned for the first few months of 2025, has been cancelled. In a statement, the organisers of the show say the Comité Permanent du Salon International de l’Automobile (CPSIA) Foundation has decided not to organise the 2025 show. Organisers have cited that ‘too many uncertainties linked to the automotive industry and the eroded attractiveness of major European shows’ influenced the decision to cancel the 2025 edition, which would have been its 92nd. The statement adds that the organisers were ‘unable to achieve [their] statutory aim,’ and that the board have formally requested authorisation to dissolve the Foundation, ending any chance under the current structure to arrange a future show in Geneva. ‘This extremely regrettable decision should not detract from the efforts and determination with which we have tried to regain our success. However, it has to be said that the lack of interest shown by manufacturers in the Geneva Salon in a difficult industry context, the competition from the and shows which are favoured by their domestic industry, and the investment levels required to maintain such a show, sound the final blow for a future edition,’ stated Alexandre de Senarclens, President of the CPSIA Foundation. At its height, the Geneva International Motor Show had been one of the most prestigious annual car shows on the calendar once pulled in 600,000 visitors and 10,000 of the world’s media at its peak and, for years, was place to unveil a new car. The 2024 show (advertised below) had been its first in four years after a pandemic-influenced shutdown. However, attitudes to motor shows had been shifting for years – even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. Car makers began to see motor shows as vastly expensive and arguably not quite as worth attending as they used to be given all of the noise focused on a few concentrated days. Then the pandemic hit, forcing the 2020 Geneva show to close at the eleventh hour. When it returned in 2024, the show was a lot smaller than it once was, as many manufacturers decided not to attend. The 2024 show’s floor plan illustrated the lack of scale compared before, using just one of the halls at the Palexpo centre in Geneva instead of all seven as per previous years. The full list of confirmed manufacturers mostly comprised of small start-ups and niche European car makers, with the only major players being Renault (pictured above), Dacia, MG, Lucid and BYD. In order to fill space, the Geneva show planners introduced curated areas designed by their own team rather than a manufacturer. These areas included the ‘adrenaline zone’, the ‘design district’ and ‘mobility lab,’ which featured cars and interactive exhibits. Despite the news, organisers of the Geneva show are continuing with their partnership in Doha, Qatar, with the next show there planned for November 2025. ‘It’s satisfying to realise that motor shows continue to appeal to brands in different parts of the world, and that the Geneva International Motor Show has reinforced its appeal in the Middle East,’ says GIMS CEO Sandro Mesquita.

446,Return of the Mack: facelifted Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/golf-gti-clubsport/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-05-31,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen made some significant blunders with the original version of the Mk8 Golf. To the company’s credit, though, it’s been quite forthcoming about its mistakes – and very receptive to criticism from both is customers and opinionated car reviewers (like us). Volkswagen launched the in January 2024, and the updated fixed a lot of the problems we had with the car. Its irritating haptic steering wheel buttons were junked in favour of proper physical switchgear, while its laggy infotainment system was swapped for the same setup found in the . Now, Volkswagen has applied the same tweaks to the fire-breathing – and the changes might be enough to thrust it back near the top of the class. Scroll down to learn everything that’s changed about the car. The styling differences mirror those on the standard Golf – so, they’re quite modest. The Clubsport gets new LED headlights, refreshed LED taillights, a set of lightweight 19-inch forged alloy wheels (which are available as an optional extra) and some very minor styling revisions for the front and rear bumpers. But that’s about it. The new taillights are worth a special mention, though, simply because Volkswagen has given them a gimmick. You can now customise the lighting signature they display from a dedicated menu on the infotainment system. There are three options to choose from. Most of the changes for the facelift are in the cabin, with Volkswagen focusing its energy on improving the Clubsport’s interior technology and build quality. We’ve seen the new car in the studio, and we were pleased by the update. The new car’s cabin feels a little more upmarket than the old one, and Volkswagen’s new 12.9-inch infotainment system is a vast improvement. It has a far quicker processor, a massively simplified menu design and an excellent shortcut hot bar at the top of the screen that allows you to jump straight to the driver assistance menu (so you can disengage lane assist without tearing your hair out). The screen runs on Volkswagen latest MIB4 infotainment software – and it’s optionally available with the company’s new IDA AI voice assistant. The technology is plumbed into ChatGPT, which Volkswagen says allows it to communicate with the driver in natural language. It can operate various cabin function (such as the heater controls and stereo) and answer almost any questions you can throw at it. Another significant change to the cabin is the new steering wheel. Instead of touch-sensitive pads for the stereo and cruise control functions, you now get proper physical buttons – which will make the car far easier to live with when you’re driving quickly. We’ve tried the new switches in the studio, and we reckon there’s very little chance you’ll accidentally push them. Volkswagen’s product marketing manager, Michael Blaul, agreed with us. He supported the switch back to physical controls saying: ‘My personal opinion is, okay, do [touch-sensitive controls] with the electric versions because the customer will oblige and will say okay, we go this way. It’s easier to set the mindset that way with EVs. ‘But in the Golf, changing that way with the Golf 8 was a mistake. It was a mistake because we had those loyal customers and we made a revolution instead of an evolution – and Golf was always evolution.’ Sadly not. If we’re being honest, though, the old version of the Golf GTI Clubsport wasn’t exactly wanting for any more poke. Like the old car, it’s powered by a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine that chucks 296bhp and 295lb ft of torque at the front wheels. That’s plenty enough. Any extra power, and we reckon you’d torque steer into the verge every time you so much as looked at the throttle. The engine is yoked to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, which is part of the reason why the Clubsport can sprint from 0–62mph in 5.6 seconds. That’s 0.3 seconds quicker than the standard GTI with the same gearbox and 0.8 seconds faster than the pre-facelift manual Mk8 Golf GTI. As an aside, you can’t have the GTI with a manual gearbox anymore. You can thank tightening emissions regulations for that. All the mechanical components in the GTI Clubsport’s chassis are identical to the pre-facelift version of the, although Volkswagen has fiddled with the calibration slightly. The biggest change is steering setup. In addition to a cybersecurity update, a chap called Seven Bohnhorst, who used to work as a test pilot for Bugatti, has provided some input on its response and weight. Volkswagen (rather bravely) says he ‘transferred some particularly positive characteristics of the steering setup of the Bugatti Pur Sport’ into the Clubsport. Somehow, we seriously doubt we’ll get that impression when we drive it, but any improvement to the car’s steering feel is welcome. Like the , the GTI Clubsport also has a special ‘Nurburgring’ drive mode. Basically, the engine, gearbox and steering are all set in their most hardcore settings, but the suspension is softened right off to allow the car to better cope with the track’s undulating surface. It sounds like the ideal mode for Britain’s B-roads, too. The facelifted Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport is already on sale in Europe so, if you have your heart set on one, keep hounding your local dealer to get your car secured. Volkswagen hasn’t yet confirmed how much the car will cost, but we’re only expecting a modest increase over the old car’s £37,000-ish starting price. More importantly for petrolheads, Volkswagen has secured the short-term future of the Golf GTI which is no small feat given the relentless march of EV legislation. While we were in Germany viewing the new Clubsport in the studio, Blaul told us the . You can learn more about Volkswagen’s plans by following that link to read our detailed news story.

447,VW's rebooted MIB4 driver interface tested: does it work?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/volkswagen-mib4-infotainment-does-it-work-/,Jake Groves,2024-06-03,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen is awfully sorry. No, really, it’s genuinely apologetic after the tirade of criticism of its MIB3 infotainment system, which launched with the and . VW’s product manager for the Golf, Michael Blaul, called it ‘a painful experience’ to endure. While VW cranked out a series of over-the-air updates for cars that ran MIB3 to help speed it up and remove bugs, software engineers quickly got going on an entirely new system – one that would address as many of the old one’s criticisms as possible. Enter MIB4, the latest software from the wider VW Group that Volkswagen and Skoda are already putting to use. The updated , , and new from Volkswagen, as well as Skoda’s latest and , are already up and running with the tech. Our first taste of it has been on the impressive ID. 7. The climate controls are now backlit – a frankly baffling oversight on the previous user interface – and there’s now a fixed point at the base of the screen for frequently used climate controls. VW has also massively upgraded the processing power, reducing lag. As well as having a customisable ‘home’ screen that shows you the information and settings most important to you, there’s also now a quick-access menu on the top that allows you to keep frequently used settings or menus within easy reach. You can customise that, too, allowing single-tap access to full-screen navigation, the car’s safety system settings, and toggle switches for things like start/stop activation or battery information. The ID. 7’s specific version also includes huge customisation of the climate-control system’s airflow via its ‘smart’ vents, and features a Wellness application (pictured above), arriving first in the estate version, that links ventilation with lighting, sound and the seat’s massage function. How many drivers will try that more than once? Not many, we suspect. In theory, much of this all sounds like progress. In practice, it’s a little murkier. What is commendable is the system’s speed – it really is much faster than even the latest version of MIB3, and the graphics are super crisp. Including those fixed areas at the top and bottom of the screen certainly reduces the number of menus. But, on the downside, it can still be fiddly trying to tap those functions while driving. While the addition of fixed climate controls is useful, the usability unravels if you want to direct the airflow from the ‘smart’ air vents (pictured above) – again, it’s screen-based and massively fiddly and, therefore, best done when stationary. What was wrong with a little plastic adjuster? The ID. 7 Tourer has a Wellness app to freshen you up, calm you down or let you nap while you’re charging. Climate-controlled seats can dry rain-drenched clothes. We’ve not tested this bit yet, but VW plans to include ChatGPT in its voice assistant (pictured in a Mk8.5 Golf) via a future over-the-air update. It has the potential to improve usability but, , we’re not massively convinced. Sort of. It’s certainly more responsive than the old system, and some of the key criticisms have been addressed.

448,Dacia Spring: Britain's cheapest EV on sale from £169 per month – and it only costs £2 to charge off-peak!,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/dacia/spring/,Jake Groves,2024-06-04,Car Magazine UK,"Thought electric cars were expensive? Think again, as the new 2024 Dacia Spring goes on UK sale priced from £14,995, with tempting finance deals from as little as £169 a month. With pricing like this, the Spring goes straight to the top of our rankings. The finance deals were announced in early June 2024 and the headline starter price of £169 a month is for a PCP lease deal over a four-year period and comes with a £2325 deposit. The interest rate for borrowing stands at 3.9% APR and there’s assumed mileage cap of 6000 a year. Fancy buying the car outright at the end of the PCP? That’ll cost you £6033. That’s the entry price of the newly refreshed Dacia Spring – a heavy update to the back-to-basics EV that’s been doing the rounds on the Continent for some years in left-hand drive form. It made its first public debut at and will wend its way to UK dealerships in October 2024. The baby EV has had a proper design and interior rethink, introducing some extra technology and features over the pre-facelift model. We already rate the Spring, having on UK roads and in its home country of Romania. Now, as it launches in right-hand drive, UK buyers are officially able to order one – and UK prices have been confirmed. As it should – it’s only a dinky thing. The new 2024 Spring features Dacia’s latest design language, with lots of blocky and boxy motifs moulded onto the car’s front and rear ends. You have to remember that this is a heavy update, not a whole new generation, so the basic car’s structure remains the same as before. Bolder details are seen everywhere, with chunky wheelarches and funky wheel designs. The brand’s name is emblazoned across the rear and lights that ape the design of the can be seen front and rear. The version pictured also features a neat vinyl motif on the front and rear bumper of a map of city streets, implying that the Spring is much more at home in the urban jungle than the real one. In fact, that (optional) map graphic is deliberate. ‘We’re keeping the same trim levels as the rest of the Dacia range [i.e. Essential, Expression and Extreme],’ Dacia design director, David Durand tells CAR magazine. ‘With the Extreme version, we thought it would be best not to put topography lines in the details of this car [unlike Duster or Jogger Extreme models] because this car will never go off road! It wouldn’t be coherent. ‘But with these stickers front and rear, the idea was also to protect the bumpers front and rear – it’s much easier to change than changing a full bumper – and we’ll propose some future collections,’ adds Durand. ‘It’s also useful for car sharers, for example, giving them the space to put their logo.’ Arguably the Spring’s biggest improvement over the pre-update model is the city car’s cabin. Naturally, the Spring has been designed to be a cheap car – as cheap as it can be – but the original car’s interior materials and layout felt one step away from sitting inside a wheelie bin. Now, though, the Spring takes a lot of design and material inspiration from the new Duster, including a very blocky dashboard featuring Dacia’s design motifs in various places. White as well as black plastic panels help to lift the interior ambience and higher-up trims can be customised with matte orange or khaki green vent surrounds. Physical climate controls feature, as does (a small amount of) steering height adjustment – the pre-facelift car didn’t have an inch of movement, making it hard to get comfortable. Every Spring benefits from a seven-inch digital instrument display as standard (above). As for infotainment, Dacia says low-end Essential and Expression models have a phone clip for you to use, while higher Extreme trim features a customisable 10-inch infotainment display also seen on the new Duster. Go for that and you’ll also benefit from wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, making it a cinch to connect your phone. Given the facelift came about in order for the Spring to meet Europe’s new General Safety Regulation 2 standards, every Spring model also benefits from a raft of safety technologies as standard, with even basic Essential models coming with a speed limiter and cruise control, rear parking sensors, AEB, traffic sign recognition, lane-keep assist and emergency call functions (among other bits). The Spring also benefits from Dacia’s new YouClip accessories system that was first launched with the new Duster, with the Spring featuring three YouClip hook points in the interior. Launch accessories include a three-in-one cupholder (it’s called a ‘three-in-one’ as it includes two more YouClip hooks on the accessory itself), a bag, a hook, a battery-operated light and a smartphone holder. You can also spec a plastic tray to cover the mechanical parts under the bonnet, giving you a small frunk area. This is the part where not much has changed from before. Every Spring benefits from a 28.6kWh battery pack that sits below the rear seats and a single e-motor driving the front wheels. The Spring is also still a light car, with its heaviest version clocking in at 984kg – just six kilograms more than the pre-facelift model. Two power variants will be available: 44bhp (known as the 45) and 64bhp (known as the 65, both named after their metric horsepower output). Both are capable of a 137-mile e-range, while the latter will sprint to 62mph in a lethargic-but-actually-fine-in-city-driving 14 seconds. The Spring can charge at 7kW AC or up to 30kW via a DC charger. Dacia says that means a 20-100 per cent charge in 11 hours on a domestic socket, four hours on a 7kW wallbox or 45 mins from 20-80 per cent via a DC charger. Dacia says you can charge its Spring up at home using smart off-peak tariffs for less than £2! On top of that, the Spring can be had with vehicle-to-load functionality – similar to what Hyundai and Kia provide as an option. V2L is only available on Extreme trim, and works via an adapter plugged into the car’s charge port, allowing you to power devices. You can have a Dacia Spring from £14,995 in the UK, making it the cheapest electric car on the market here right now. The full price list looks like this: Deliveries begin to arrive in October 2024.

449,The war on cost: the economics of making cheap electric cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/the-war-on-cost-the-economics-of-making-cheap-electric-cars/,Tim Pollard,2024-06-04,Car Magazine UK,"Is the tide turning against the EV start-ups aiming to topple established car makers? A few years ago, it seemed that Tesla, Rivian and other arch innovators had the world in their grasp; unencumbered by legacy businesses, industrial footprints and the pesky need to switch from fossil fuels to volts, they had the inspiration and clean-sheet plan to dominate in a carbon-crunched world. A few short years later, conditions are much tougher. The appetite for electric cars has stalled in many western countries, economies are tough post-Covid and there’s a new threat from a quarter that was once unimaginable: China. No wonder Elon Musk’s dithering over plans for a smaller EV, after announcing a drop in production and transaction prices (the average Tesla sale value has fallen from $50k in 2022 to $39k this spring). It’s not alone: Rivian earlier this year posted a $5.4bn annual loss and cut 10% of its staff. It’s tough being a disruptor. Are they sleepwalking into something that business schools label ‘the innovator’s dilemma’? First identified by academic Clayton Christensen, it’s the process where an arch disruptor innovates so successfully that it wins plaudits, market share and profits by identifying a new market – only to then stagnate as the new kid on the block becomes the norm and is itself targeted by the next wave of entrepreneurs. Many successful companies fall prey to the dilemma as they mature, lose focus and forget agility: think Nokia or Kodak. Could the same thing happen to Tesla and other EV wannabes? Probably not any time soon, if plans for the Model 2 (above) come good. But there’s one business opponent that’s hellbent on exploiting Tesla’s maturation – and it’s . Research giant Gartner forecasts that half of the world’s EVs will hail from China by the end of next year, up from a quarter in the first half of 2022. ‘This will imply a significant reduction in sales by incumbent leaders, particularly in China, as people will shift from petrol- and diesel-fuelled vehicles built by the incumbents to Chinese-made EVs,’ its analysts note. Thanks to a long-term industrial strategy funded by the communist government, China has cornered the supply of raw materials and production of the batteries required for electrification: 70 per cent of global battery cell manufacturing takes place in China, and BloombergNEF’s annual lithium-ion battery price survey suggests that the country’s production cost of $126 per kWh undercuts production costs in the US by 11 per cent and Europe by 20 per cent. It’s a stark reminder that geopolitics, trade deals and imperial strategy have been deliberately aligned to secure China’s competitive advantage. It’s an endless game of cat and mouse, as manufacturers from east and west seek an edge. Automotive consultancy Bernstein observes that Chinese newcomers are watching technical innovations, especially around injection moulding, battery integration and integrated stamping, to mimic the very latest production practices from the likes of Tesla and the German premium brands: ‘Chinese competitors have adopted a “fast follower” strategy and are looking to quickly replicate Tesla’s best practices, including both production and design.’ What does all this mean? At the time of writing, four of the 10 cheapest electric cars on sale in the UK today are from Chinese producers. Sobering when you realise that these first cars are merely the warm-up act.

450,Refreshed BMW 1-series drops the i and gains a new OS,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/1-series/,Jake Groves,2024-06-04,Car Magazine UK,"BMW’s family hatchback, the 1-series, has been given a thorough going over for 2024. Part of that refresh is, naturally, some exterior design tweaks, with the 1 benefitting from a new, tidier nose and grille design (which reminds us of the headlights on the grey model). Inside, some tech from higher up BMW’s ladder has trickled down to its smallest car. The engine range has also seen a bit of a rationalisation, as the new 1-series launches with just 120 and M135 versions. Nope – not anymore. BMW has dropped the ‘i’ tag at the end of its nomenclature (which used to stand for ‘injection’ and was code for petrol engine cars) for this new facelifted model. Part of the reason is likely due to the fact the new 1-series only offers petrol engine models anyway, and another part will be because ‘i’ has been repurposed for BMW’s EVs. Only took the brand about 10 years to tidy this up, given how old the i3 and i8 are nowadays, but there you go. Anyway, yes, your choices of engine at launch for the new 1-series comprise a conventional 120 and a potent M135 xDrive. The 120 (pictured in grey) uses a three-cylinder mild hybrid engine that develops 168bhp and 206lb ft and is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. BMW says the 120 is capable of a 7.8 second sprint time, a top speed of 140mph, fuel economy between 47-53.2mpg and emissions between 121-135g/km. As for the sporty M135 xDrive (seen in white) version, that features a 297bhp/295lb ft four-cylinder engine, a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive. BMW says this model is capable of a 4.9sec 0-62mph sprint time, a limited top speed of 155mph, fuel economy between 34.8-37.1mpg and emissions between 174-184g/km. The M135 xDrive benefits from BMW’s ‘Adaptive M Chassis’ and a sportier steering ratio included, and can be specified with an M Technology Package (available from autumn 2024) that includes more suspension upgrades and lightweighting measures, performance ‘M Compound’ brakes and 19-inch alloys. As well as the new exterior design, which aims to de-crease the 1-series’ earlier look, the interior has had a significant overhaul. It’s been simplified, with all leather removed and BMW’s latest OS9 infotainment system thrown in. Every 1-series has the dinkier version of BMW’s curved display with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto included, as well as heated seats, LED headlights and automatic air con. M Spot versions throw in sport seats and adaptive suspension. Tech options include a wireless phone charger, adaptive LED headlights, two-zone climate control, a panoramic glass roof and a Harman Kardon audio upgrade. BMW UK says the new 1-series is available to order now. The 120 version is priced at £29,950, while the M135 xDrive starts from £41,000.

451,Alfa Romeo Junior EV priced from under £34k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alfa-romeo/milano/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-06-05,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Alfa Romeo Junior, a new fully-electric crossover that promises to be ‘electric according to Alfa Romeo.’ The new SUV was revealed in Milan on 11 April but, just four days later, Alfa had to change its new model’s name to Junior, after objections from government officials infuriated that a car assembled in Poland was named after Italy’s second city. It’s a bizarre u-turn on the EV’s name, which was chosen by public vote. Alfa CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato said: ‘We decided to change the name, even though we are not required to do so, because we want to preserve the positive emotion that our products have always generated and to avoid any controversy.’ The revised name is one from the Alfa back catalogue, originating on the 1966 GT 1300 Junior version of the Giulia. Two electric Junior models are confirmed for the UK: a 154bhp EV badged Elettrica and a more powerful 278bhp Elettrica Veloce range-topper. Buyers elsewhere will be able to pick from four models, as buyers in Europe will also be offered a 2wd 134bhp hybrid and a 134bhp four-wheel-drive Q4 hybrid. Whether or not they’ll make it to our shores eventually remains to be seen. That’s par for the course when it comes to Stellantis: we had a similar degree of uncertainty when it came to the , which arrived as an EV first, but later added hybrid and petrol power. After the name change, Alfa Romeo has announced UK pricing for the new model, with the ‘Elettrica’ EV version starting from £33,895, with upper Speciale and more powerful Veloce versions costing £35,695 and £42,295 respectively. Back in 2022, Alfa Romeo CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato announced a ‘zero-to-zero’ mission, which stated the brand’s target to go from no EVs to 100% zero-emission sales by 2027. The Junior (né Milano) is the first car in that ambitious plan. Alfa Romeo’s range has an extraordinary stretch: from the heights of the 33 Stradale supercar to the new Junior . Based on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger, and well, most Stellantis EVs, it’s a bold step into the most populated – and importantly profitable – sector yet. Alfa used to cover the small car market in the past, with mixed results (at the global launch CEO Imparato described the EV as a spiritual return for the Giulietta and Mito), but this is very different. At 4.17m long, 1.5m high and 1.78m wide, the car-tist formerly known as Milano is of similar size to the Jeep Avenger – which isn’t a huge coincidence, as the base Elettrica shares the same powertrain as Jeep’s adventure-but-in-the-city EV. That means the Junior shares Stellantis’s 54kWh battery pack and makes 154bhp. Range clocks in at 255 miles for the base Elettrica, with no figure given for the sportier 278bhp Elettrica Veloce – but we’d expect it to be a little less long-legged. The faster Ellectrica Veloce uses the same powertrain as that found in the Fiat 600e Abarth. The promise of 100kW DC fast-charging is available on both EVs, so you’ll be able to go from 10-80% in fewer than 30 minutes if the charger is potent enough, the company claims. Alfa is also releasing two hybrids: the first is a mild one with a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbo, mounted to a 48v battery,  21kW motor and six-speed auto ‘box. Like the Jeep eHybrid, it’ll be able to use EV-only propulsion at low speeds in the city – with common scenarios including parking, and slow traffic. The word here is ‘efficiency,’ not performance. The Junior sets itself apart from the Avenger, Fiat 600e, and other Stellantis EVs by doubling-down on classic Alfa styling. Like so many new EVs nowadays, it looks to the past to regain some character that might be lost to its EV powertrain. There’s certainly a lot going on at the front end… With that in mind, the Junior is an interesting blend of sporting detail and classic looks: as you’d expect, there’s minimal overhangs at either end, strong wheelarches and a cut-off tail that harks back to the legendarily stubby Giulia TZ. It looks mild in pictures, but is far more dramatic in person. The Milano gets instantly recognisable ‘3+3’ headlights that you’ll find on other contemporary Alfas, though here they form more of a C-shape than before. The EV version gets a bold, remixed grille with an enlarged Alfa logo, while the hybrid gets something more traditional and retro. Pictures here are of the electric model. There are six colours available at launch: Arese silver, Sempione white, Navigli blue teal, Brera red, Galleria ivory and Tortona black. The final touch comes with gaping 20-inch wheels which give the EV far more aggression than its expected £26k price tag would have you expect. It is essentially the same mechanical package as the small Jeep EV and other related family members – no matter how much the design team have gussied it up in Italian finery. This points to a capable and effective drivetrain and chassis, if perhaps missing that Alfa fizz we’ve come to know and love over the years. Still it’s been toned up at least: the new 2024 Alfa Romeo Junior (né Milano) has been honed by the same team that developed the . Put through its paces and refined at the brand’s Balocco testing centre, the Junior promises to be one of the sportiest crossovers on the road, if you believe the PR spin. The Veloce edition offers the most direct steering in its segment for that classic Alfa feel, while its sports suspension is 25mm lower than standard for better cornering poise. Front and rear anti-roll bars have been stiffened and the Veloce also gets chunky 380mm front discs with 38mm four-piston monobloc calipers to wipe off speed with nonchalant ease. Like other Alfas, the EV is configurable with the DNA system, standing for Dynamic, Natural and an Advanced Efficiency mode. The Alfa also has a wider track than other cars on the same platform. The Junior’s interior gives Alfa designers another chance to differentiate its smallest car from anything inside or outside of Stellantis. To that end, the is designed to be as driver-focused as possible, with a ‘telescopic’ instrument panel that adds a bit of retro charm. Sabelt sports seats grip the front passengers, and add a little more of a dynamic feel in more dynamic trim levels. After some time in the car you’ll find a generally higher level or quality and premium feel than in many mainstream rivals – whether it’s in the speed of the infotainment system or the Alcantara on some of the surfaces. That aforementioned cockpit contains a 10.25-inch TFT screen that shows you everything you need to know, and there’s also a centre-mounted 10.25-inch touchscreen for all the other stuff. Because this is designed to be a funky car – it’s very much a style-obsessed Alfa – the air-con vents mimic the quadrifoglio cloverleaf pattern long associated with the Milanese brand. Of course. Like the Tonale, the baby Alfa has to go out and claim an entirely new customer compared to before and that means stats like bootspace actually count. As well as paying attention to the lines of and chassis dynamics of the Junior, Alfa engineers have made room for a 400-litre boot, giving it the largest capacity in the sector. Other sensible features include standard-fit parking sensors, level 2 autonomous technology (aka radar cruise control) and a neat space under the bonnet for storing your charging cable and EV paraphernalia. Order books for the Milano opened in Italy in April 2024, and order books for the Junior opened a few days later. There’s no UK price confirmed for the new crossover yet (let alone a line-up) but expect the electric Alfas we’ll get to start suspiciously near the Jeep Avenger’s £34k asking price.

452,Toyota investigated in Japan over safety certification irregularities,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/toyota/safety-certification/,CAR magazine,2024-06-06,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has admitted to providing incorrect or manipulated safety certification data in its home country of Japan. The news originally came to light on 26 January 2024, when Toyota received instructions from Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) to conduct investigations into its model certification application. On 3 June 2024, Toyota Motor Corporation reported six instances involving seven models produced since 2014, including some discontinued ones, where testing methods deviated from national standards. On 4 June 2024, Japan’s transport ministry raided Toyota’s headquarters, which had already resulted in the suspension of three of the firm’s car models from production. The company has subsequently halted the production of three car models only available in Japan: the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio, and the Yaris Cross manufactured in Kanegasaki. Toyota has also faced further allegations of using modified vehicles in safety collision tests for models that are no longer being manufactured. Toyota chairman, Akio Toyoda, apologised to customers a day before the raid took place. ‘We neglected the certification process and mass-produced our cars without first taking the proper precautionary steps,’ Mr Toyoda said. ‘As the person responsible for the Toyota Group, I would like to extend my sincere apologies to our customers, car enthusiasts, and all stakeholders for this issue, following Hino, Daihatsu, and Toyota Industries Corporation. I am truly sorry.’ Toyota sold over 11 million passenger vehicles in 2023, however, the recent findings are said to not affect cars currently on the roads. Toyota spokesperson told in a statement: ‘This relates to a certification issue that is only applicable to vehicles sold in Japan. As such, any vehicle bought in the UK or Europe is not affected.’ Meanwhile, other Japanese car makers have responded, with Honda confirming past instances of improper testing regarding noise and engine power. However, Honda assures that its vehicles are safe to drive and cars sold in Europe are also not affected."
453,Piëch GT: start-up supercar launches in 2028 with 1000bhp,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/piech/gt/,Georg Kacher,2024-06-07,Car Magazine UK,"Remember the Piëch GT concept from a few years ago? No? The original concept was revealed at the 2019 Geneva motor show and was pitched as a battery-electric grand tourer led by son of the . The start-up mothballed the original concept from back then to work on it further, and this is the new generation. So here it is, the definitive Piëch GT. Still only a full-size clay model, the fetching 2+2-seater is the work of David Seesing, the man behind Forge Design in London whose most recent claim to fame is the stillborn TVR Griffith. The 1800kg sports car named after one of the European car industry giants (Toni is Ferdinand’s son and one of the master’s thirteen children) is 4780mm long, 2000mm wide and 1350mm tall. It sits on a 2780mm wheelbase, and its carbon fibre belly is filled with 16 battery modules each of which contains 312 individual cylindrical cells. The total capacity adds up to 90kWh which feeds two electric motors each rated at 375kW/550Nm for a combined output of over 1000bhp and 811lb ft of torque. Although the first running prototype won’t be complete before late next year, Piëch is already advertising key performance figures like a top speed of 187mph, a 2.6sec acceleration time from 0-62mph and a WLTP range of 312 miles – solid stuff, but nothing the new Porsche Taycan turbo could not match for similar money. The newcomer will thus also have to score with soft assets like rarity value, the ability to generate a made to measure product and, most significantly, the allegedly truly emotional driving experience. The design, a radical departure from the homespun initial effort, confirms the restart. It combines a subtle British touch – think Aston or Jaguar – with generic GT proportions, chunky German solidity signalling exceptional torsional rigidity and a distinct premium appeal emphasised by thin cutlines, jewel head- and taillights and machined full-frame 22-inch wheels. Although the windscreen, the rear window and the black roof form one contrasting whole, we may still see detail changes like a frunk, a lift reducing aero kit or enlarged air intakes on a TBD high-performance spin-off. We don’t know yet what the interior looks like, but Tobias Moers is adamant that the Piëch GT will offer the widest possible choice of colour and trim options and that no two cars will be same because personalisation extends to the software by inviting the user to compose an individual soundtrack, to dial in the preferred individual dynamic DNA and to even generate artificial vibrations – think movers and shakers – for an unrivalled tour de force at the wheel which makes the mind boggle. The underpinnings of the Piëch GT are quite straightforward. The multilink suspension is steel sprung front and rear, braking is by extra-cost carbon-fibre rotors, the rack-and-pinion steering is of the variable-rate and variable-effort kind. A steer-by-wire option may be added at a later stage. There are no fancy air springs, no active anti-roll bars, no rear-wheel steering, no all-wheel drive alternative at this point. The most striking single feature is perhaps the Piëch Dual2 Drive layout which splits the propulsion duties in two, allocating an independently operating high-tech motor to each rear wheel. Motor and wheel are connected by a two-speed gearbox which can, again, do its own thing irrespective of the counterpart’s set-up and response. Both power units entertain their own separate torque vectoring, traction control and variable locking ratio properties masterminded by the Piëch Torque Controller in combination with POSA, short for Performance Oriented Software Architecture. The first gear ratio is 1:9, second is a longer-legged 1:5. Ralph Illenberger, formerly with Mercedes-AMG and Aston Martin, details the principle: ‘The Dual2 Drive system transfers the typical sports car feeling we know from high-performance combustion-engine models to the quieter on-off realm of EVs. The key strength of the e-motor is its ability to unleash instant maximum torque at low rpm. Its main weakness is the declining torque- power curve at high rpm which kind of cushions the full-throttle high-speed acceleration. We compensate this downside by emphasising power over torque: shifting from first into second, either manually or as part of the selected drive mode, provides that familiar kick in the butt which feels like the high-speed, high-rev boost effect typical of a proper sports car.’ According to the senior power broker and his equally committed co-CEO, the power delivery is punchy and progressive rather than linear and synthetic, allegedly bringing back fond memories of an old-fashioned V8-engined crackerjack. The other innovation Piëch claims will make a big difference are the batteries and the elaborate cooling system which ensures the drivetrain’s thermal well being even on the track and when hooked up to a 500kW fast charger. In essence, the GT uses the same industry standard 21700 cells as a wide variety of hand-held power tools. Among the available suppliers are household brands like Samsung and Panasonic as well as dedicated specialists like EVE (China), Molycell (Taiwan) and Universell (Germany). Cost is not the main issue here. With cell tariffs ranging from 2.80 to 4.00 Euro for a 4.5amp item, the price for the complete power pack varies between 16,000 and 20,000 Euro – that’s less than a tenth of the complete vehicle’s asking price. More decisive are factors like energy density, heat resistance, degradation and safety. Since cooling is key, Piëch has embarked on a multi-redundant sealed total immersion layout which entertains two oil circuits, two water circuits and two just-in-case chillers to ensure maximum stability even under extreme operating conditions. Quips Tobias Moers: ‘We can feed energy at a constant maximum 500 kW from beginning to end, boosting the state of charge from 10 to 80percent in under ten minutes which is not bad at all in view of the current infrastructure limitations.’ The modular vehicle architecture fuses a carbon fibre monocoque with an aluminium front end subassembly and a steel rear axle module. Although the wheelbase is defined by the size of the battery, there is virtually no limit to the number of potential body styles. While Tobias Moers rules out a four-door coupé (‘everybody has one, but the market doesn’t seem to like them’), a CAV crossover, a proper SUV, a extended-wheelbase saloon fit to accommodate 19 battery modules, a high-performance coupé and any type of bespoke few-offs are all on the shortlist. ‘We won’t do a facelift,’ says Moers. ‘Instead, the plan is to use the Mk1 platform over two relatively short five- year cycles with either a complete redesign or a broadening of the range at the halfway point.’ While some start-ups embark on a strict online sales and marketing strategy, Piëch will do things the traditional way and appoint a bunch of high-end luxury dealers with an initial focus on the Middle East and Europe, to be followed by North America and the Far East. Having worked with Multimatic before when he ran the show at AMG (AMG one) and Aston (Valkyrie), Tobias Moers saw no reason to look for a new R&D partner when he signed the dotted line at Piëch. This time, however, the focus is not on the small manufacturing facility in the UK but on a bigger and more streamlined factory near Toronto, Canada. The idea is to build an initial batch of 2000 cars in 2028 and 2029, to increase the output to 4500 or even 5000 units with the addition of a second four-door model (think GT-4), and to reach an initial ceiling of 7000 to 8000 vehicles per annum at the beginning of the second life cycle in 2033 when a Purosangue type CAV is likely to join the fray. Toni Piëch expects the company to break even in 2029 and to be profitable the year after, with a solid EBIT of 14percent earmarked for the series one products. Right now, the company has 70 mainly small investors and 30 full-time employees, but these numbers are bound to soar as the second round of financing is due to generate around 100m Euro, more than double the initial investment. Middle East funding is pivotal with Arab family offices and local wealth management funds among the most prominent backers. ‘The magic is in the brand,’ claims Toni Piëch (picture above, left) who arrived at the Stuttgart makeshift launch location in a white Ferrari F12 on Swiss plates, not in his Urus or the Huracan, and certainly not in the unique Bugatti voiture noire that was his late father’slast special commission. ‘The brand depends of course on the product which is 80percent Tobias. My role is to be the entrepreneur who must hold this enterprise together by convincing our backers that we are here to stay.’ On the R&D side, Piëch’s number one ally is perhaps the Bosch Engineering Group (BEG) who agreed to mastermind the complex integration of hard- and software by means of a highly flexible central control unit and an ultrafast CAN bus connection. Not dissimilar to the Hand of God black box under development at the BMW M GmbH for the next all-electric four-motor 1000bhp M3/M4, the BEG brain power must integrate the individual talents of the Piëch GT into a pace-setting new entity which has total driving pleasure written all over its sleek body. ‘We could never afford to develop our own cells,’ acknowledges Tobias Moers, ‘but we can buy the best batteries that are out there on the market. ‘We could not fund that byte-powered megabrain either, but we can buy the top-notch know-how others – like the Chinese manufacturers – have helped to establish. At the end of the day, it’s the mix that makes the difference. And as a team, we are confident that this very special mix is spot-on in more ways than one.’ One of the world's leading motoring journalists, Georg has been a staple on CAR magazine for six decades. Incredible, but true. This extraordinary experience means that Georg has probably scooped it, driven it and rated it before anybody else!"
454,New Hyundai Bayon: UK pricing revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/bayon/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-06-07,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has revealed UK pricing for its new Bayon, with the SUV set to start at £22,480. Three trims are available  – Advance, Premium and Ultimate – but all come with the same 1.0-litre turbocharged T-GDi engine good for 99bhp. A six-speed manual or seven-speed DCT is available, pushing out 127ft lbs or 147ft lbs of torque respectively. The entry-level Advance gets, among other things, 16-inch alloys, auto headlights and two 10.25-inch screens. Premium starts at £23,880, and adds automatic climate control, 17-alloys, and other modcons such as privacy glass as well as a heated steering wheel and heated front seats. Ultimate starts at £25,280 with the six-speed manual and lays on the luxury; there’s a Bose sound system, wireless phone charger, electric sunroof and other bits like Blind Spot Collision Warning. Read more about the Hyundai Bayon below. Hyundai’s new Bayon crossover is an official replacement to the ix20 – remember that? No worries if you can’t, this is designed to be a more – ahem – youthful offering, taking on everything from Ford’s Puma to the Peugeot 2008, Nissan Juke and new Vauxhall Mokka. Hyundai says the name comes from the city of Bayonne in France; the brand points out that all of its SUVs have destination-based names to split them apart from the conventional car range. Yes, but stay with us. The Bayon certainly doesn’t look anonymous – that’s for sure – something that’s almost a requirement in order to stick out in one of the most crowded classes of car these days. There are some familiar Hyundai cues here: split headlights at the front like the Kona, Tucson and Santa Fe, and a glass-heavy rear end with very interesting kinks in the surfacing. We’re getting strong Pontiac Aztek vibes from the rear, but in a good way for once. In order to inject at least a little bit of pizazz, Hyundai has listed several new colours (including the new Mangrove Green, pictured) that can be accented by an optional black roof. Inside, a lot of the design has been taken from the i20 hatchback: big screen in the centre, digital dials, straked vents that stretch across the width of the dashboard. Bluelink connected services include information like cloud-based navigation for more switched-on route planning and, where applicable, live parking info including where there are spaces and how much they’ll set you back. As for safety tech, every Bayon has lane-keeping, high-beam and speed-limit assistance as standard, as well as an alert when it notices the car in front pull away in traffic. As for space, it’s about average in terms of space available in the Bayon, with a 411-litre boot – a smidge smaller than you’d get on a Nissan Juke or Ford Puma. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
455,New Mini Cooper: five-door version revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mini/cooper/,Jake Groves,2024-06-12,Car Magazine UK,"Mini has introduced a new five-door, family-friendly Cooper to the range. It joins the lineup as a stretched-out, 4,036mm variant of the new three-door Cooper – that’s 172mm longer, to be exact, and 72mm longer than the previous-generation five-door. Only standard-issue Mini petrol engines are on offer here. There’s a Cooper C model with 153bhp or a Cooper S with 201bhp. They’re the same as you’ll find in the new three-door Coopers, but acceleration takes a hit with the extra weight of the longer chassis – 8.0 seconds for the five-door C (7.7 in the three-door) and 6.8 seconds for the five-door S (6.6). With easier access to the rear bench and a little more room when you get there, the five-door Cooper should appeal to small family car buyers, but they come at a slightly higher price. The same three trims are available – Classic, Exclusive and Sport – but the five-door Mini starts from £24,050 – just under £2000 more than the three-door Mini Cooper – while the S starts from £28,450. It really does look the same as the EV edition, so much so that even the sporty Cooper S model doesn’t have a visible exhaust tailpipe. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, as the new-shape Mini has really pared back some of the wilder design choices from older design choices and we’re left with a mostly clean design that’s still familiar. Details include those multi-LED rear lights with customisable light signatures, sporty wheel designs and the options for bright and dual-tone colours. Inside, the Mini Cooper C and S also features the same circular central infotainment screen as the electric model. The dashboard has a fabric surfacing that uses recycled materials and the screen itself is heavily customisable. Mini says there are two versions of its combustion-powered Mini hatchback, the C and the S. See here for performance specs, which seem to be broadly similar to the Cooper E and SE EV models: Mini also says there are three trim levels: Classic, Exclusive and Sport. Every Mini features the brand’s ‘Experience Modes’, has a seven-speed dual-clutch auto (RIP manual Minis), cruise control, rear parking camera and navigation. Exclusive adds some more decorative details, while Sport throws in some JCW-flavoured bits including a sport-tuned transmission for more aggressive shifts. The brand says the three-door Cooper C will be priced from £22,300, while the Cooper S will start from £26,700. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

456,Easy does it: revised BMW 2 Series Coupe unveiled,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/2-series-coupe/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-06-12,Car Magazine UK,"… Look, it’s another updated BMW! Munich has had a busy couple of months, launching revised versions of the , and since April 2024. Now, though, it’s the turn of the – and it looks like BMW decided to play it safe. On the surface, at least, not much has altered over the previous version of the car. The updated 2 Series Coupe (and it’s tyre-shredding counterpart, the )  looks largely the same as before. The biggest differences are a new chrome grille, body-coloured side skirts and a revised colour palette that now includes the Fire Red metallic finish you see on the car in these images. It’s the same story on the inside, with the biggest change being some new infotainment software. It adds a redesigned hot bar at the bottom of the central screen and new voice command support for items like the heated seats and heated steering wheel. Other changes include new control knobs for the dashboard air vents, a redesigned flat-bottomed steering wheel and a tweaked ambient lighting system with a waterfall effect for the central air outlets. You can also now have the car’s seats trimmed in velour, cognac faux leather or black real leather as an optional extra. There are still three options on the table, all of which feature petrol engines and eight-speed automatic gearboxes. The cheapest option in the range is the 220i. It’s priced from £36,865 – and it’s powered by a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit that produces 181bhp and 221lb ft of torque. BMW says it can sprint from 0–62mph in 7.5 seconds and hit a top speed of 146mph. More importantly, it returns between 41.5 and 44.1mpg on the WLTP combined cycle. Above that, there’s the 230i. It has a more potent version of the 220i’s four-cylinder engine, with 242bhp and 295lb ft of torque. The extra grunt trims the car’s 0–62mph time down to 5.9 seconds and increases its top speed to an electronically limited 155mph. Prices for the 230i start from £40,320. At the top of the standard 2 Series Coupe range (i.e. before you reach the ), there’s the M240i xDrive. It’s powered by a turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine that produces 368bhp and 369lb ft of torque. As its badge suggest, this version of the 2 Series comes with all-wheel drive as standard. The extra poke and added grip help to slash the car’s 0–62mph down to 4.3 seconds, although top speed remains the same as the 230i at 155mph (thanks to the electronic nanny). Prices start from £46,045. A few odds and sods. The M240i is fitted as standard with passive M Sport suspension as standard, but you can pay extra to have the chassis upgraded with BMW’s adaptive dampers. They have three different damping profiles to suit each driving mode. BMW has also added a new augmented reality function for the 2 Series Coupe’s sat-nav, which uses the car’s front camera to overlay navigation instructions onto a live feed of the road ahead. It can be displayed on either the infotainment screen or the digital gauge cluster and is designed to make it easier to steer through tricky intersections. Finally, BMW has improved the level of standard equipment on the 2 Series Coupe. Now, every version of the car comes with Parking Assistant as standard, which can automatically steer the car into end-on and parallel spaces. Front and rear parking sensors are also now standard.

457,Brute force: updated 2024 BMW M2 Coupe launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m2/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-06-12,Car Magazine UK,"BMW is on a roll with its model updates at the minute. In the past two months, we’ve seen refreshed versions of the , and . Now, though, BMW has followed those launches up with a revised version of one of our favourite cars in its range – the M2 Coupe. It’s important BMW gets this update right, too, because it hasn’t exactly bathed adulation for its most recent work. The facelifted 1 Series, for example, was mocked by enthusiasts for dropping its manual gearbox and aping the styling of a Kia Ceed. The company’s designers should at least get an easier ride with the M2, though, mostly because they haven’t done very much. The biggest changes to the car’s exterior are some new black badges, a few new paint options and a fresh set of lightweight alloy wheels, measuring 19 inches on the front axle and 20 inches at the rear. That’s it. Instead of fiddling about with cosmetics, BMW played to the M2’s strengths. So, rather than choking down its engine (like it did with the revised version ), BMW boosted its output by 20bhp. Plus, unlike the 1 Series, BMW will still offer the M2 with a manual ‘box. Praise be. Scroll down to learn everything we know about the car. The M2’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine now produces 473bhp and 406lb ft of torque. That torque figure is the same as the previous version of the car, but the slight power increase is enough to shave 0.1 seconds off the manual model’s 0–62mph time, and 0.6 seconds off its 0–124mph time. Now, the sprints take 4.2 seconds and 13.7 seconds respectively. If you go for the automatic gearbox (which we strongly advise you don’t), the M2’s peak torque figure climbs to 442lb ft. That trims the car’s 0–62mph time down to 4.0 seconds flat. You can also opt for the brand’s M Driver’s Package on both versions of the car, which raises the top speed limiter from 155mph to 177mph. In addition to the extra poke, BMW also says it’s fiddled with the M2’s throttle map to try and improve response. Nothing else has changed about the car’s chassis or running gear but, given how sweet the old car was to drive, that’s fine by us. Yes. BMW has fitted the revised M2 with a new flat-bottomed steering wheel. It’s trimmed in leather as standard, but you can have it finished in Alcantara as an optional extra. Both versions of the steering wheel are heated as standard. The car’s infotainment system has also been loaded with BMW’s latest software. The biggest change is a new hot bar on the bottom of the central screen which BMW says makes it easier to adjust the cabin temperature and seat heating controls. Plus, you can also now adjust the settings using voice commands. Lastly, the M2’s cabin trims are now finished in Dark Graphite matte as standard, although you can optionally swap the pieces out for carbon fibre or new brushed aluminium replacements. If you’re a particularly keen driver, you can also still specify BMW’s carbon-backed sports sears and carbon fibre roof as further options. Right now – and we’re very pleased to report that, despite the upgrades, the new BMW M2 Coupe is cheaper than the old one. Prices for the previous version of the car started from £65,915, but this updated version is just £63,360. We’re not questioning it. Unfortunately, that’s the price for the automatic M2. In a break from convention, the car’s manual gearbox is now offered as an optional extra – but ticking that box will only set you back an extra £545. First deliveries will arrive in autumn 2024.

458,"The CAR Inquisition: Bob Pauley, Pixar Production Designer",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/porsche/bob-pauley-pixar/,Ben Barry,2024-06-14,Car Magazine UK,"‘They’re characters that happen to be cars, not the other way around,’ says Pixar production designer Bob Pauley, sketching out lead character Lightning McQueen on a piece of paper. Nearby sits long-time collaborator Jay Ward, these days Pixar’s creative director, chipping in a few anecdotes as we go. Both are car guys – Pauley owns a 1967 Volvo P1800, Ward’s collection includes an Austin-Healey and an air-cooled Porsche 911– so while both knew Cars had to appeal beyond the car niche, their knowledge ensured an almost unbelievable level of accuracy for the 2006 film. It’s not just them; Pixar hosts an annual ‘Motorama’ for employees. Similar attention to detail was invested in researching the landscape, with a road trip that informed backdrops and key characters too. ‘We had three Cadillacs, 10 people and we headed out on Route 66 for nine days to understand that world and the world of cars,’ Pauley recalls. ‘I was taking soil samples in Arizona – some dirt is purple, some is red – then going through Galena, Kansas, we turn the corner and there’s this old pick-up truck with a tow hook – that became Mater. We met Dawn Welch who runs the Rock Cafe in Oklahoma – she inspired the character Sally.’ Now 55, Pauley grew up in California, studied graphic design and illustration at San Jose State University and started out doing character merchandise at a theme park before moving into film animation. He worked on Tim Burton’s , joining Pixar aged 31, with his first credit. When Cars development began in the late 1990s, matching characters to cars and understanding how those cars would anthropomorphically express themselves was essential groundwork. The big breakthrough came as Bobby Podesta (now Pixar supervising animator) experimented with rudimentary animation models to find ways of making cars interact with one another like humans do. Throughout, it was always important to stay true to the spirit of the cars. ‘Luigi is quick and sporty, he has narrower tyres. Sheriff is like two doughnuts away from a heart attack, so he’s a larger ’49 Mercury, he’s got soft springs, a nice kind of soft roll.’ Perhaps most intriguing is the balance Pixar’s animators had to strike between faithfully recreating the dynamic language of cars, while judging when to break free of reality. ‘We actually set the suspension up for the cars the way they would be,’ chips in Ward (pictured above, right). ‘So when McQueen and Mater are scared of Frank the combine and they’re running through a field, Mater is just drifting along because his suspension is so soggy and McQueen’s like a racecar if you drove a racecar through a field – so hard he bounces. A Fiat 500 has transverse leaf suspension – we dialled all that in. ‘But the cars don’t respect the materials, and for instance with Sally we cheated the mouth forward a little bit to get light on it, we made the windscreen much more upright and shortened the dimensions.’ Along with stock car Lightning Queen, Sally, originally conceived as a Ford Mustang (after the song) soon became a 996-generation 911. ‘A Porsche is fast enough to keep up with McQueen, the engine’s in the back so there’s no big grille that looks like a moustache and the headlights on that generation weren’t round, so they didn’t look like eyes [Pixar chose to place eyes on windscreens, not headlights],’ explains Pauley. Given period technology, getting the cars to look natural and literally reflect the world around them was a hugely time-consuming task. ‘You had to kind of fight the symmetry to get a natural asymmetrical view of the cars, and then if you look at the reflections in Doc Hudson’s chrome as he talks, that’s literally hours and hours to render a single frame. These days things are much faster, but that just means we spend more time on other aspects.’ Ward also notes that now ‘there’s much more blending between disciplines, so the digital folks have become much more artistic and the art folks are much more technical.’ Pauley and Ward artfully dodge questions about a follow-up to 2017’s . Almost 20 years since the first instalment, though, one thing’s certain: if does return, it’ll still all start with a sketch. ‘A brown ’72 Ford Capri with a crank sunroof bought from auction in San Jose. I couldn’t drive stick so the night before I learned in a buddy’s pick-up but I still stalled the Capri in the middle of an enormous intersection on the way home.’ ‘Personally it has to be my wife and two wonderful kids. In the film world I think .’ ‘I banged up the family Pinto station wagon when I connected with a concrete post in a parking lot.’ ‘The nine days I spent on Route 66 with the team. You can look at that stuff in a book but you don’t get the feel of it.’ ‘Classic. Mid to late ’60s is a sweet spot. The GT40 is a favourite and I own a 1967 Volvo P1800. Supercars now, the forms don’t excite me as much and they seem more like financial investments.’ ‘She’s a facelift, when Porsche re-did the lights [correct]. There was something neat and specific about that one.’ Former staffer Ben is now freelance and remains one of the go-to writers for whenever the editor needs a supercar thrashed or a judicious comparison test written. An expert on all things four-wheeled, Ben's particular skillsets include feature writing, impartial news reporting and driving around corners sideways."
496,Cadillac’s Sollei concept is for the glam sun-seekers of the future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/cadillac/sollei/,Jake Groves,2024-07-23,Car Magazine UK,"Cadillac’s confidence is growing, with its new Sollei conceot showing how it could build future one-off cars. The brand says the car’s name is derived from ‘sol’ (meaning sun) and ‘leisure.’ The Sollei is an all-electric, four-seat convertible that looks heavily based off its grand Celestiq luxury car. The brand’s design cues are everywhere, including a bold grille arrangement with glowing badge and vertical lights and utterly enormous chrome wheels. Fine details are everywhere, including the milled aluminium frame for the windscreen and graphics of sunbursts perforated into the seats. In a nod to Cadillacs of the late 50s, the Sollei is finished in a colour called Manila Cream (Bird’s Custard probably doesn’t have the same ring to it), and the interior features etchings of classic Cadillac convertibles on the centre console. Inside, it’s also a sea of wood veneers and yet more creamy yellow hues in the Nappa leather upholstery. Cadillac has also used a material called Fine Mycelium from MycoWorks – something derived from the fibres of mushrooms – in some of the panelling. And, given this is all about wafting from beach house to marina, the Sollei features a drinks chiller in the second row for keeping a bottle of fizz with you at all times. While unconfirmed, Cadillac will very likely show off the Sollei at 2024’s Pebble Beach concourse event during this year’s Monterey Car Week.

459,Vauxhall’s EV price-matching offer spreads to vans,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/vauxhall-s-ev-price-matching-offer-spreads-to-vans/,Tom Webster,2024-06-17,Car Magazine UK,"The point where reach the same purchase cost as their petrol and diesel counterparts has come a big step closer as Vauxhall has effectively price matched its Combo Electric small van. The brand has announced some offers that mean you will pay the same amount for the EV version as you would for the diesel equivalent. Vauxhall has already been price matching some of its petrol passenger cars with their electric equivalents, but this is the first time that it has been done for a commercial vehicle. This should represent a big boost for smaller businesses and sole traders that are put off the idea of buying an electric van because of the initial purchase cost. It’s worth noting that, as with the passenger cars, the matching is based on a monthly cost rather than an outright cash purchase. Vauxhall gives two examples, based on the two trims in the Combo range, Prime and Pro. The Prime is available for £329 a month with a £1,974 deposit, while the Pro is £365 a month with £2,190 up front. Both are with a 6,000-mile annual limit over a 60-month term. Vauxhall reckons that the Combo Electric will then be able to save buyers £91 a month, with the £0 rating VED resulting in a £26 saving. The remaining cost saving is courtesy of fuel savings, assuming you make the most of those 500 miles a month. The offer is not yet available on any of Vauxhall’s bigger vans, but is something it has provided on the likes of the , and . However, those are comparing a five-year term for the electric and a four-year term for the petrol vehicles. Vauxhall is also throwing in another slightly left-field offer – 50,000 Tesco Clubcard Points when you buy one of its cars through an official retailer. This equates to £500 of credit to use at Tesco. Both offers are available now.

460,"Faster, leggier and (slightly) lighter: revised Audi e-tron GT launched with up to 912bhp",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/e-tron-gt/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-06-18,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has given the a comprehensive update. The firm has fiddled with almost every part of the , tweaking its chassis, motors, battery pack and charging system to keep it competitive with newer rivals such as the and . Audi also seized the opportunity to launch a new RS performance version of the e-tron GT. It’s the most powerful car the company has ever built, with a colossal output of 912bhp and a stomach-churning 0–62mph time of 2.5 seconds. The updated Audi e-tron GT will hit UK showrooms in August 2024. Audi hasn’t yet confirmed prices for the car but, considering how much has changed over the old car, we’re expecting a significant increase. Scroll down to learn everything we know so far. Audi has addressed our biggest complaint. The e-tron GT has always been pitched as a continent-crossing super-tourer – but you couldn’t drive it much further than 200 miles without stopping to charge it. But the new e-tron GT has a lighter, more energy-dense battery pack that promises to fix that. Its gross capacity has climbed from 93kWh to 105kWh, boosting maximum range to 375 miles. Despite this, the new battery is nine kilogrammes lighter than before. Audi found this extra power by adjusting the chemistry of the battery’s cells and improving its cooling system. Plus, Audi has increased the power of the e-tron’s regenerative braking system, so less energy is wasted when decelerating. And when you do eventually need to stop for some electricity, you won’t be waiting around as long. Now, the e-tron GT can charge at speed of up to 320kW. That means, if you can find a charger capable of supplying that much power, you’ll be able to drive for 174 miles after just 10 minutes of charging. There are now three versions of the car – the S e-tron GT, the RS e-tron GT and the – and performance has improved across the board. The S e-tron GT is the entry-point to the range, but it still has two electric motors delivering a healthy output of 671bhp. Audi says that’s enough for a 0–62mph time of 3.5 seconds. The RS e-tron GT used to be the flagship of the range. It’s now the middle option, which gives you an idea of just how much harder Audi is pushing the car’s platform. It churns out 844bhp and can sprint from 0–62 mph in 2.8 seconds. The new flagship model, the RS e-tron GT performance (above), has supercar-rivalling levels of performance. It has roughly the same amount of power as a and can sprint from 0–62mph as quickly as a . Audi has made some changes to the RS models’ powertrains to improve their drivability. Changes include stronger driveshafts and optimised mapping, which it says has smoothed out the power delivery. There’s also a new ‘boost’ function that gives the driver an extra 94bhp at the push of a button. To help support all this extra power, Audi developped a new two-chamber active air suspension system for the e-tron GT. The tech is fitted as standard on Vorsprung versions of the car – and Audi says it has improved the car’s driving dynamics without compromising on comfort. The firm’s engineers claim it can keep the GT’s body almost horizontal during hard cornering, braking and accelerating by jacking up the corner of the car on which the G-forces are acting. It also has a comfort entry feature which can raise the car’s ride height to 77mm when parked (which is 55mm higher than normal). Lots of little things. Audi has fitted it with a new flat-bottomed steering wheel, fresh wooden trims for the dashboard and centre console and new treadplates. The cheapest S e-tron GT variant also now comes as standard with 14-way electrically adjustable seats, while Vorsprung variants can be optionally equipped with a massage function. Buyers get a few technology upgrades, too. Audi has reskinned the RS e-tron’s digital gauge cluster with a white power gauge, as a tribute to the white analogue dials fitted to the 1994 RS 2 Avant. Plus, you can specify a new polymer-dispersed liquid crystal panoramic sunroof as an optional extra. The tech means the glass panel can be switched from completely transparent to entirely opaque at the touch of a button. Audi has one eye on the environment, too. The e-tron GT’s cabin uses loads of sustainable materials – namely a sustainable microfibre called Dinamica and a recycled fabric called Cascade. The car’s carpets and floor mats are also made from Econyl, which is made entirely from recycled nylon fibres from reclaimed production scraps and discarded fishing nets.

461,X-rated: new BMW X3 revealed with 392bhp engine option,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/x3/,Seth Walton,2024-06-18,Car Magazine UK,"Just when you thought BMW’s wrap-lifting season might’ve bowed out, it goes and launches a new . You’re looking at the all-new, fourth-generation BMW X3 – a remaster of one of the segments heaviest hitters. As a former Bavarian best-seller – over 3.5 million of them have been sold over the previous three generations – this is an especially important reveal, even among the most esteemed of its recently updated siblings. Looking to continue the success of the X3 badge, BMW has given its SUV a full refresh, with striking new looks – much in line with the rest of the current BMW lineup – a revamped interior with the latest iDrive systems and a bigger boot. Oh, plus an enhanced engine lineup that now includes a six-cylinder power unit producing just shy of 400bhp. Want to learn more? Read on for everything you need to know about the new BMW X3 from CAR. If you want to know how it drives, we put a prototype model through its paces earlier this year. You’ve seen it now, so the new face is probably worth discussing first. With its sharp lines, blocky build and L-shaped headlight elements, the new X3 features some of BMW’s latest design language, as found on a few other members of the current crop. That could prove divisive as it already has on a raft of other models, but where the electrified five series and combustion five series models are nearly identical, the new X3 is a stark removal from the concept – its spiritual all-electric twin. Juxtapose the two together and the new X3 looks positively vanilla. That being said, all model except the range topping M50s feature out-of-sight exhaust pipes integrated into the rear bumper, so there a few subtle nods to an electrified avant-garde. But while the upcoming Neue Klasse X will sit on a bespoke chassis, the fresh X3 remains on the CLAR WE architecture line. The new model is 34mm longer than the outgoing generation, while 29mm wider. It’s also a touch lower (25mm) to crank up the sportiness, according to BMW (not verbatim). The new X3 will be available with four different engines, all with BMW’s xDrive AWD technology, an eight-speed transmission and a 48-volt mild hybrid system. The engine lineup includes a diesel, a hybrid and a six-cylinder M-line unit at the top of the range. Bottom-spec 20 xDrive models produce 205bhp and 243ft lbs of torque. The diesel 20 can’t quite match that power output with 194bhp, but it’s made up for with 295ftlbs of torque. The plug in hybrid spec on offer, the X3 30e, utilises a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine alongside an electric motor for a total system output of 296bhp through an eight-speed transmission. According to BMW’s WLTP figures, the PHEV X3 will be able to cover between 50 and 56 miles on electric power only. The plug-in hybrid system does, however, come at a cost of boot space. The new ICE X3s have a slightly more commodious boot compared to the last generation with 570 litres on offer (extends to 1,700) but the PHEV can only carry up to 460 litres (1,600). At the top of the engine range is a twin-turbo six-cylinder unit that produces 392bhp and 398ftlbs of torque – the most powerful in-line six pot ever fitted to an M model. It’ll knock off 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds and go on to an electronically limited 155mph top speed. M50 models also benefit from a plethora of M trimmings, including up-rated M Sport brakes, an M Sport diff, 20-inch M wheels and an optional adaptive suspension system. BMW says that all models will benefit from the new X3’s lower body weight and wider track in terms of cornering stability and comfort value on the road. Trick new set ups on the front and rear axles will assist turn in, the marque adds, while tweaks to the steering axle develop straight-line ability. From our drive of the , the developments work well to enhance the X3’s dynamic side. Yep, that’s been updated, too. The new X3 cabin sports the same single curved display and infotainment screen, as is now commonplace across the rest of the range. From our experience, the displays are supremely crisp, clear and doddle to use, so it’s unlikely any previous-generation X3 owners will have any qualms. BMW’s interior lighting stitches are also present and correct, extending around the front section of the transmission tunnel, under the infotainment display and in the passenger doors. The gear selector has also been updated – now a clear crystal switch to match the rotary knob which will look familiar to any drivers of the latest BMW generation. To complete what looks like a well-refined and elegantly revamped interior, the steering wheel now has a flat bottom edge for a touch for modernism. The new X3 will come with electronically adjustable front seats as standard, while a host of upholstery materials are on offer. Prices for the new X3 start from £46,800. That’s for the petrol 20 engine model, producing 205bhp for a 0-62mph for 7.8 seconds and a top speed of 134mph. The 20d will set you back £48,210 for 194bhp and 7.7 seconds to 62mph while the hybrid starts from £56,340, producing 296bhp for a 0-62mph of 6.2 seconds. The diesel and the hybrid both share the same 134mph as the petrol 20 X3. If you want a top of the range M50 to chase some lingering performance dreams then that one costs £64,990, but it does produces 395bhp and can get from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds. Not that these are all recommended retail prices as on the road prices haven’t yet been announced.

462,Back from the dead: Volvo V60 and V90 estates return to the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/estates-return/,Graham King,2024-06-19,Car Magazine UK,"Antique dealers and other big boot lovers of the world rejoice: Volvo estates are making a return to the UK. The and were – along with their S60 and S90 saloon counterparts – but will be available once again from July (the saloons won’t). At the time, it made sense for Volvo to axe all it’s non-SUV models from UK price lists because they accounted for less than 10% of the Swedish brand’s sales here. Despite the fact they remained available elsewhere in the world, and UK emergency services could still get hold of the V60 and V90. But never underestimate the power of the consumer to get a decision reversed. In a statement released to CAR Magazine, Volvo said: ‘We removed the V60 and V90 from sale in the UK last August amid falling appetite for estate cars. While this remains a long-term trend, we have seen a resurgence for our estate products in recent months and have decided to reintroduce the V60 and V90 to our UK portfolio in response to this. We will begin taking orders next month. ‘When operating in a fast-moving industry, we continually re-evaluate our product portfolio to ensure we have the right mix to serve all our customers. As part of this process, it is not uncommon for us to remove certain models or derivatives from sale and reintroduce them later. ‘We were thrilled by the many comments from customers and media last year, with many stories and memories of how our estate cars have been a huge part of their lives. We look forward to helping create more!’ We don’t know at this stage which powertrains will be available in the V60 and V90. But reports suggest the V60 will be offered with the 197bhp B4 mild-hybrid petrol engine, and the 350bhp T6 and 455bhp T8 plug-in hybrids. The V90 gets both the plug-in powertrains, as well. It’s not clear how long the V60 and V90 will be back on sale for. Both cars are getting on in years – the V60 was launched in 2018 and the V90 in 2016, so they are nearing the end of their product cycles. It’s worth noting that production of the S60 saloon has just ended in the USA, though the S90 is still being churned out in China. We also don’t know what the future holds for the Volvo estate in general as the brand switches to an all-electric line-up. There is an ES90 electric saloon in the product plan and it surely wouldn’t be too much bother to spin an estate off it. If there’s the demand for such a thing, of course… Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"
463,Retro revival! Ford’s RS200 and Mk1 Escort to be remastered,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/boreham-motorworks/,Jake Groves,2024-06-24,Car Magazine UK,"The wild will be given a new lease of life as Boreham Motorworks announces ‘a series of continuation and remastered’ versions of some of Ford’s most memorable models. , a division of the DRVN Automotive Group, is an official licence partner of Ford, working to create road cars and motorsport models. The first model being remastered for the 21st century is the RS200 – Ford’s infamous that turns 40 years old in 2024. The new RS200 model will be built from the ground up, with the aim to include many facets of the original’s engineering as possible – namely a mid-engine, all-wheel drive configuration and lightweight construction. Next up will be a version of the Mk1 Escort. Boreham Motorworks is calling this one a continuation, taking heavy motorsport inspiration from the Group 5 racing model driven by Alan Mann. The team say it will create a ‘blueprint-accurate, period-sympathetic’ car with continuation VIN. And both of these projects have Ford’s blessing. ‘We are thrilled to embark on this journey with Ford Motor Company and kickstart a series that will redefine and remaster these icons of the past,’ says DRVN group executive chairman, Darren McDermott. These two will be just the start, with Boreham Motorworks intending on creating five more ‘iconic Ford vehicles’ over the years to come. Exactly the question we put to Boreham Motorworks – after all the Mk1 Escort and RS200 are two of Ford’s most iconic models. Surely you don’t just hand the keys to recreating them to the first people that ask. The answer is apparently legwork – the DRVN team are said to have spent plenty of time in Detroit, getting to know the right people. Indeed, the relationship with Ford managing director Jim Farley is said to be ‘great’, and there are some key hires at Boreham Motorworks behind the scenes as well. We’re expecting to learn more about this in the coming weeks. It also helps to understand a little more about the . Boreham Motorworks is the newest offshoot of a collection of companies that also includes DRVN Advanced Engineering – a consultancy established in 2005 that works with automotive OEMs doing hush-hush development work and high-performance vehicle engineering – air intake and filtration specialists ITG, Evolution E-Types and JE Motorworks. The former is fairly obviously a concourse-grade E-Type specialist and moderniser, the latter a Land Rover specialist with storied and historic ties to the brand. This includes building and developing Paris-Dakar cars for the company and becoming renown for its experience with the Rover V8. It now largely concentrates on restomods. Then there’s Alan Mann Racing, which has ties to Ford dating back to the 1960s when it worked directly with the blue oval to develop competition cars with a roster of drivers including Jacky Ickx, Graham Hill, Frank Gardner, Sir Jackie Stewart and Bruce McLaren. Suddenly it all starts to make sense… We understand that Boreham Motorworks will be at 2024, in the capacity of hosts for clients, potential customers and some VIPs. Hopefully this should mean a little more info will be forthcoming around the middle of July. Finally, the word ‘remastered’ probably puts you in mind of (though that’s actually Reimagined) and . But unlike those vehicles, we’re told that all of the Boreham Motorworks machines will be new from the ground up, rather than based on donor vehicles.

464,King of the hill: Ford wins Pikes Peak hill climb with F-150 EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/ford/supertruck/,Seth Walton,2024-06-24,Car Magazine UK,"Ford has claimed an overall victory at this year’s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb event, besting 60 other competitors with a juiced up, . The circa 1,600bhp monster– known as the SuperTruck – was piloted by seasoned Ford EV specialist and former 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Romain Dumas. He made it up the hill in eight minutes and 53 seconds to top the day’s time sheet, beating silver medallist Christian Merli and his Wolf Aurobay GB08 by 10 seconds. The win marks a second successive Pikes Peak class victory for Ford Performance, the team having taken last year’s Pikes Peak Open class top spot (second overall) with a massively overpowered all-electric van in the style (ish) of a Transit, known as . On race day, this year’s SuperTruck couldn’t beat the SuperVan’s time of eight minutes and 47 seconds, but it was able to eclipse the latter’s qualifying result by over seven seconds with a record time of 3:32.8. Both were set by Dumas. Dumas could’ve potentially set a faster final result time this year had he not experienced a technical issue within the first few corners of his run. Instead of retiring, the French veteran was able to perform a reset on the car while stationary,  then continue his climb up to an incredible victory. ‘I’m honoured to achieve this victory with Ford Performance at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb,’ he said after the win. ‘Everything about this event is a challenge because it is unlike any other form of racing, you only have one shot. We faced a challenge early on but that only gave me more determination to make up the lost time in the rest of the run.’ Though it may lack the polished genteel of other racing events, the Pikes Peak Hill Climb is still, unequivocally, a member of the motorsport event royal family. First held in 1916, race day tasks competitors with ascending a 12.42 mile track to the summit of the Pikes Peak mountain as fast they can – a course that includes over 156 turns and 2,862m of elevation change between the starting line and the chequered flag. Needless to say, making it up the mountain in rapid time is an incredibly dangerous feat, and several people have lost their lives at the event since its inception. The most recent fatality was in 2019 when motorcyclist Carline Dunne lost control of his Ducati Streetfighter V4 at the final corner, a tragedy that swiftly prompted organisers to ban the motorcycle class altogether from then on. With such great risk, the event has garnered a uniquely unhinged pool of followers and competitors over the years. You’ll find the most eclectic mix of battle-worn machinery in the paddock, but for the bigger manufacturers like Ford Performance, it presents an opportunity to indulge in some engineering appetite. The fastest time ever recorded up the track was set by none other than Romain Dumas in 2018, driving a one-off Volkswagen I.D. R prototype specifically designed for the course. He was able to set a hugely impressive 7:57.1 – faster than the next best ever time by over 16 seconds.

465,New BMW M5 revealed: meet M’s heavyweight plug-in hybrid,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m5/,Ben Miller,2024-06-25,Car Magazine UK,"It had to happen. No, really: M division felt it had no other option. The new G90 M5 simply had to be a hybrid. When work began on the car a full six years ago, as soon as the then-controversial all-wheel-drive F90 was unveiled (the wailing lasted only as long as it took us to drive the thing), M’s senior team surveyed the uncertain global outlook and decided it simply couldn’t risk another engine-only M5. ‘Electrification remains an issue,’ says CEO Frank van Meel. ‘Maybe it slows down a little but it will not go away, and the countries are all different. They’re not consistent, and they’re not consistent in their direction. You have to be flexible, and with the M5 now we are flexible in every direction. We don’t lose where we came from and, at the same time, we can be ready for changes. Without electrification we ran the risk that we would not be allowed to sell the car in certain markets.’ The result is an all-new, bigger, heavier, faster and more powerful M5 of significant complexity. It sits on the same platform as the new-gen 5-series and i5, obviously (and gains rear-wheel steering, among other things, by doing so) – a platform in which M had a good deal of input at the gestation phase, bracing it for the additional power it’d end up putting through it. There’s a V8 up front, again, though it’s a different engine to the F90’s, being the S58 unit that arrived with the X5 M/X6 M. The gearbox houses an electric motor (drawing from an 18.6kWh battery, weighing around 220kg, under the floor), and the V8 and e-motor can work independently, driving through the transmission and xDrive all-wheel drive (in electric-only mode this is a 195bhp EV with 206lb ft, an 87mph top end and an official range of 43 miles) for a bombastic turn of straight-line speed: 0-62mph in 3.5sec and 189.5mph from a system capable of 717bhp and 738lb ft (it could cook up more torque but that’d break the gearbox). You’ll notice that, visually, this M5 is more exuberant than its predecessors, with bulging arches over beefier track widths (increased 75mm at the front over the 5-series; 48mm at the rear). They’re testament to M’s work in mitigating the extra weight the hybrid powertrain has thrown its way. And there is, sadly, quite a bit of additional weight. This is a 2435kg M5 (2375kg if you spend big on the right lightweight options, including the carbon roof and ceramic brakes). Dirk Hacker, M’s head of development and van Meel’s right-hand man, breaks the circa 465kg increase (the F90 M5 Comp weighed in at 1979kg) down as 220kg for the battery and 50kg for the motor, noting that the rest can be blamed on more metal (this M5 is a larger car in every dimension) and a higher level of standard equipment. ‘The biggest challenge was the grip on the front axle – we didn’t want to lose that precision and agility,’ explains van Meel. ‘So, we have a wider track, and not just for optical reasons. This is what we needed to get back into the sweet spot, and we managed it quite well I think.’ The interior, familiar yet enhanced here with some M-specific flourishes, not to mention its trademark steering wheel, is roomy and suitably well-appointed. M’s carbon buckets aren’t an option, understandably, though they’d be handy to help counter the nagging sense that you sit a little high (in terms of hip height there’s a small but real difference: 523mm in the F90 versus 564mm here). The 5’s vast touchscreen houses the myriad set-up options, including those of the hybrid system, but you need only brave their granular detail once before grouping them and assigning them to the M1 or M2 button. UK M5s will get the M Drive Professional pack as standard, including a neat M division answer to digital distraction: M Track Mode. It turns off the multimedia screen, the driving assists and, should you have Radio 4 on at the time, the shipping forecast, so you can focus on the job at hand. The bundle also includes the M Lap timer, Boost mode and Dynamic Plus (two additional hybrid modes: Dynamic, for sustained fast road running or 20-minute track slots, and hot-lap-ready Dynamic Plus). Prompt Boost mode with a long pull on the left gearshift paddle, ideally at lower speeds for optimum fireworks. The e-motor will briefly work against the V8, allowing it to build boost pressure for no increase in speed, before letting fly with everything both motors can give. Can anyone recall asking for a bigger, heavier, more powerful M5? No, us neither. But at least we have another M5, and its electric-only range – not to mention its monstrous turn of speed and impressive dynamics – will likely make it a compelling, road-focused all-rounder, particularly in big-booted Touring guise. The saloon is on sale now, priced from £110,500, with first deliveries in November. As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy.

466,Aston Martin Valiant: Fernando Alonso’s track-focused take on the British muscle car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/valiant/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-06-26,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Aston Martin Valiant, a track-focused version of the Valour commissioned by the unofficial king of Spain himself: Fernando Alonso. A collaboration between Aston Martin’s bespoke Q department and the double-world champion, the Valiant takes the muscle car vibes of the and adds performance in every area. And yes, it still uses the same V12 as the Valiant, though with a power hike. Just 38 units will be made globally, with deliveries to begin in the final part of this year. They’re almost certainly all accounted for, but you’ll be able to close to an example of the Valiant at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it’ll be driven by Alonso. ‘Valour was a spectacular celebration of Aston Martin’s 110th anniversary, and stirred me to create a more extreme, race car inspired version that was track focussed, while also delivering a thrilling drive on-road,’ he said. ‘Valiant is born from my passion for driving at the limit and I have enjoyed working closely with the Q by Aston Martin team on both the design and technical specification and believe we have created a masterpiece.’ The Victor and Valour are brutes, but the Valiant goes even further in the name of lap times. The most obvious change, then, comes in the form of new carbonfibre bodywork that taps into Aston’s muscle car roots. Gaydon says its designers have also used the marque’s ‘Muncher’ Le Mans racer as inspiration too. There’s a deep front splitter at the front, while a new carbonfibre grille increasing cooling to all-new brakes and an upgraded front-mounted V12. Aero discs inspired by the Muncher, with each reducing turbulence and drag whilst improving cooling. At the rear a new fixed wing sits above the same sharp Kamm tail as the Valour. Gaydon’s engineers have stuffed a huge, carbonfibre diffuser the bottom of the Valiant along with four exhaust pipes. One can only imagine the CFD numbers its generating. It looks like a classic 70s or 80s racer, but everything underneath is cutting-edge, designed to increase performance and save weight. To that end the Valiant uses a 3D printed subframe to save 3kg without a reduction in stiffness, along with a magnesium torque tube for a saving of 8kg. The largest savings come room the introduction of a lithium-ion spec battery which saves a huge 11.5kg, and the new lightweight 21-inch magnesium wheels which reduce unsprung mass by 14kg while increasing agility. The brakes are upgraded too; now ceramic and measuring 410mm x 38mm at the front and 360mm x 32mm at the rear axle. New Adaptive Spool Valve (ASV) dampers finish off the handling improvements. Capable of switching to one of 32 damping curves in less than six milliseconds, Gaydon says they bring the most noticeable change over the softer, less taut Valiant. Don’t worry, the 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 of the Valour is still here, now with an increase in power to 735bhp and 555ft lb of torque. That’s around 30bhp more than before. It’s still fitted to a six-speed transmission too, with power fed to the rear wheels. In order to make use of the extra power, Gaydon’s engineers have tweaked the driving modes: Sport, Sport+ and Track to makes things a little easier on the driver. The inside of the Valiant is ‘Aston Martin does motorsport,’ so expect a mixture of premium materials and lightweight trinkets and a steel half cage that allows four-point harnesses. It starts with an old-school steering wheel to minimise driver distraction, and the seats are also Recaro Podium units – but trimmed with Alcantara. The manual gearbox is celebrated inside too: Gaydon’s interior designers have exposed the H-pattern gear knob’s linkage, creating a nice blend between motorsport and intricate luxury. Quiet you! And yes, sort of. A few years ago, Alpine released an Alonso version of its lightweight, hardcore – only Fernando had already announced he was leaving the team when it was unveiled. Whoops. In contrast, the Valiant isn’t an Alonso signature model, but rather a limited run tribute to a car already commissioned by the F1 veteran. Plus, he’s still driving for Aston Martin’s F1 team, at time of writing. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
467,Fault finding: facelifted Volkswagen Golf R launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/golf-r/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-06-26,Car Magazine UK,"We’ve always liked the , but it’s always been plagued with irritating problems that made it downright infuriating to live with. Volkswagen has looked upon our frustrations with pity, though, and launched an updated version of the car which it says is sharper, faster and – crucially – more user-friendly. Don’t adjust your screens. This is the facelifted version of the car – but the styling changes are so subtle that we reckon Volkswagen’s own design team would struggle to tell it apart from the old Golf R at 20 feet. The tweaks stretch as far as a lightly massaged front bumper, some new alloys and a shrewd head- and taillight redesign. The revised Golf R will hit UK showrooms in autumn 2024, rejoining a rapidly shrinking pool of super hatchbacks that includes the , and the fire-breathing . Scroll down to learn everything about the car or, if you want to know what the new car’s like to drive, check out our . We’ll start with the interior, because that’s where you can see the changes most plainly. The most obvious difference over the old car is the new 12.9-inch touchscreen – and were happy to report it’s a huge improvement over the outgoing model’s disobedient, dawdling, dim-witted Casio calculator of an infotainment system. Not only does it have far superior graphics, but it also has lightning-fast processors. That means it can now keep pace with your commands. Plus, it shares its menu design with the latest Passat, which we think should be hailed as the textbook example of sensible Germanic thinking. The icons are massive (which makes them easy to hit on bumpy roads), there’s loads of contrast (which means it’s a doddle to quickly scan the screen and spot the widget you want) and you now get a fixed climate hot bar that allows you to quickly adjust things like the air conditioning and heated seats. Look carefully at the top of the screen, too. There’s a little car icon that takes you directly to the driver assistance menu, where you can disengage lane assist with a single poke. That’s blissful. You had to cycle through half a dozen menus to switch it off in the previous version of the car. Volkswagen has fettled the R’s steering wheel, too – just not in the way you might expect. The revised Golf GTI received an all-new wheel with physical buttons in place of the old car’s touch-sensitive sliders. However, Volkswagen tells us it was too expensive to fit the same wheel to the R, simply because it doesn’t have space for an ‘R’ button. But the placement of the R button was one of our biggest issues with the previous Golf R. It falls right under your palms when you’re driving with your hands at 9 and 3 (which is where they should be when you’re pushing on), meaning we’d always unintentionally change drive modes on a twisty stretch of road. To fix the issue. Volkswagen adjusted the amount of pressure required to operate the button. Now, the ‘R’ mode switch acts more like a physical button rather than a haptic one – you need to hammer your thumb into the switch with the force of a hydraulic press rather than tickle it like you’re petting a new-born pup. Again, Volkswagen’s updates are quite subtle. You get the same turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine as before, although it does have ever-so slightly more poke. Power has crept up from 316bhp to 328bhp which, being honest, isn’t really enough for you to notice the difference. What’s more interesting is Volkswagen’s new wastegate map. The company’s software wizards have fiddled with the R’s throttle management and boost controller to force the turbo to hold more pressure when you lift off the throttle. The aim is to reduce lag and improve throttle response, allowing you to use more of the engine’s performance more of the time. And, hells bells, does it work well. You can learn more about how it feels to drive by reading our , but we’ll give you a brief rundown of the sensation here. With the tech engaged, the Golf R’s resting boost pressure jumps from 4psi to 11psi (which is a massive increase) and the throttle is far more fervent in the lower half of the rev-counter. If you switch the car into R mode on the move, you can also feel the engine race forward as the new map rams extra boost pressure down the engine’s gullet. It’s like anti-lag lite. The Golf R’s chassis hasn’t changed much save for a dash of recalibration, but Volkswagen has given it a fresh set of lightweight forged 19-inch alloy wheels. They’re available as an optional extra, and they shave around 8kg off the car’s kerb weight. To celebrate the launch of the facelifted car, Volkswagen has introduced a new Black Edition trim level. No prizes for guessing what that entails. It has black paint, black wheels, black brake calipers, black badges and privacy glass. Oh, and it’s also had its speed limiter raised from 155mph to 167mph. The Black Edition will be a limited run special, which will be available from when the revised car is launched in autumn until the end of 2025. Prices haven’t been officially released, but Volkswagen’s top brass tells us it’ll cost around €4,000 (around £3,400) more than the standard car.

468,Volkswagen Group to make up to $5bn investment in Rivian for software help,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volkswagen/rivian-investment/,Jake Groves,2024-06-26,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen and Rivian have announced a joint venture to develop software for next-generation vehicles. VW Group will first invest $1bn in Rivian, ‘with up to $4bn in planned additional investment,’ and the joint venture is designed to ‘create next-generation electrical architectures and best-in-class software technology. The move consists of a lot of money for Volkswagen but makes sense for both brands. Rivian is currently under some financial pressure; the US-based electric car brand announced it would have to lay off 10 per cent of its salaried workforce in 2024, with that it projected no production growth this year. For Volkswagen, enlisting the help of an super switched-on start-up outsider like Rivian (known by many in the industry to have created much of its own slick software) could help it out of its own CARIAD-shaped software hole. The Group has been hampered by software and UX issues for some years now, including and the much-delayed PPE platform that dented the rollout of its ID cars and wider group models like the respectively. So much so that, in a statement from Rivian, the announcement includes a line about the joint venture allowing ‘Volkswagen Group to utilise Rivian’s existing electrical architecture and software platform’ in the short term. Funny, that. In the mid-to-long term, the fruits of the joint venture mean that both brands can accelerate their software development, and ‘it is expected to allow both companies to combine their complementary strengths and lower costs per vehicle by increasing scale and speeding up innovation.’ Both companies ‘aim to launch vehicles benefitting from the technology created in the second half of the decade.’ RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian said in the statement: ‘Since the earliest days of Rivian, we have been focused on developing highly differentiated technology, and it’s exciting that one of the world’s largest and most respected automotive companies has recognized this.’ ‘The partnership fits seamlessly with our existing software strategy, our products, and partnerships,’ says VW Group CEO, Oliver Blume. ‘We are strengthening our technology profile and our competitiveness.’ It’s not the first time Volkswagen Group has looked to external help in furthering its development goals. In February 2024, it announced that it would enter into an agreement with Chinese car maker Xpeng, , to develop two ‘smart e-cars’ (pictured above) for the Chinese market.

470,Nyobolt EV: electric Lotus demonstrates sub five-minute charging time,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/callum/nyobolt-ev/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-01,Car Magazine UK,"British battery-tech firm Nyobolt is now able to demonstrate 10-80 per cent charging that takes less than five minutes in its fully functional Nyobolt EV prototype. The Cambridge-based firm says its patented next-generation ‘carbon and metal oxide anode’ materials and low impedance battery cell design can therefore deliver twice the charging speed of most of the currently on sale. What’s more, Nyobolt says its new batteries will maintain performance for up to 600,000 miles – and can prove this thanks to successful completion of over 4000 full DoD (Depth of Discharge) fast charging cycles. That too is a considerably greater than present technology claims. The low impedance cell design also helps to keep temperature under control, meaning that even in or during high-speed driving, the battery pack never exceeds 60 degrees. With integrated control systems and cooling solutions, Nyobolt suggests its new tech could easily be retrofitted into existing EV platforms. We had the same thought – and it’s true that the Lotus Elise-based Nyobolt EV demonstrator has a tiny (by modern standard) 35kWh battery pack. But this and the associated 155-mile perhaps matters less if you can consistently charge it that quickly, as this tech claims. And keeping the battery small does mean controlling the kilos, as well as the cost. The demonstrator is said to weight just 1250kg. A lot for a Series 1 Elise (which came in at under 800kg), but not much for an EV. Nyobolt’s point, however, is that its battery tech can maintain its maximum charging capability for longer. Using a 350kW 800v DC fast charger, that 10-80 per cent run has been clocked at just four minutes 37 seconds – with the first four minutes maintaining a constant 500A current, and equating to 120 miles of extra driving range on their own. For context, the battery and charging tech can achieve 10-80 per cent in 18 minutes in optimum conditions – which Porsche has put quite a bit of effort into helping owners understand, including adding a predictive charging time display into the instrument cluster options. This is on a 97kWh battery pack, using 320kW 800v DC. As a result, Porsche says it can add 186 miles of range in 10 minutes to a car weighing over 2200kg. The Taycan’s previous battery technology has a less than flawless reliability record, though. Nyobolt is already ‘in conversation’ with multiple OEM vehicle manufacturers about the adoption of its novel solution, with robotics and heavy goods applications also being explored. A decade and a half after some upstart firm out of California used the Lotus Elise as a starting point for an electric car, Norfolk’s finest is getting another lease of life. The Nyobolt EV is the product of battery firm Nyobolt and design agency CALLUM, and utilises the talents of the Elise’s original designer, Julian Thomson. The Nyobolt EV was conceptualised by Thompson before he joined GM and finished off by , the eponymous design house founded by ex-Jaguar designer Ian Callum. Design talent meets groundbreaking tech, too – Nyobolt claims to have solved several of the existing problems with lithium-ion batteries. You know when sci-fi movies use existing cars but put them on dished wheels and fit funkier lights to them? That’s the sort of universe the Nyobolt’s come from. Thomson’s reimagined the Lotus Elise but with ‘exaggerated proportions’ – this EV is 100mm wider and 150mm longer than its inspiration. It sits on 19-inch wheels and the body panels (none of which are shared with the Elise) are a lightweight composite. A raised waistline makes the silhouette even more dramatic, while LED lights front and rear help modernise it. On the concept (the silver car in the pictures), the Rover Metro door mirrors of the original were swapped out for cameras. But the functional prototype has returned to the use of old-school reflective surfaces – a decision we commend. The charging port’s discreetly located just behind the door on the B-pillar, and most importantly the roof panel lifts out for open-topped motoring. ‘The aim was to evolve the design and bring it up to date while keeping that iconic sports car character that was so well received in the Elise,’ explained Aleck Jones, creative lead at CALLUM. ‘Typically, you run into feasibility issues with initial sketches and a design loses impact as it moves from concept into reality, but incredibly – and thanks to the close working relationship between CALLUM’s design and engineering teams – we have been able to realise our early images and unique vision in the real world.’ Tesla famously used an Elise as the basis for its back in the noughties – something that CEO Elon Musk admitted was a ‘super dumb strategy’, as accommodating a motor and batteries required the platform to be almost totally redesigned. Nyobolt achieves a claimed range of 155 miles from 35kWh of battery capacity – that’d mean efficiency of 4.4mi/kWh or thereabouts, which is definitely impressive but more a byproduct of the car’s light weight and slippery shape, we suspect. The Tesla Roadster claimed 244 miles from its 53kWh unit back in 2008. But Nyobolt claims the batteries themselves are smaller and lighter than those used today, and by simplifying the charging process says that their 35kWh unit can be charged in just six minutes using existing charging infrastructure. We suspect ‘can’ rather than ‘will’ to be the case here. The maths checks out with the most powerful 350kW chargers currently in deployment at a few dozen sites across the UK, but even under ideal conditions these chargers rarely deploy their full power. Even if that turns out to be more like ten minutes per charge in the real world, though, it’s highly impressive. Nyobolt says it’s subjected the battery to over 4,000 fast charging cycles ‘without significant performance loss’, and that it can be safely fast-charged to over 80 per cent without damage, something that’s typically not recommended for existing lithium-ion batteries as the heat involved causes the battery to degrade. Unlocking faster, more stable charging and getting the maximum range out of reasonably-sized batteries is key to improving EVs from the driver’s perspective. The typically stuff in more than 100kWh of cells, which makes the cars immensely heavy, has implications on packaging, and takes eons to charge, especially from home chargepoints. Unlocking petrol-style (the average stop at a UK petrol station is claimed to be seven minutes) would solve this problem, even if overall range is reduced. And smaller, lighter batteries would make the cars better to drive, improve packaging, and consume fewer materials (such as dubiously-ethical rare earth metals) in their manufacture. Plus, small and light batteries mean you can develop small and light cars – like the Nyobolt EV. The Nyobolt EV may just be a show car at present but the firm isn’t just some upstart making bold claims. Nyobolt received £50m of funding in 2022 to build a battery manufacturing plant in the UK and says low volume production could start in 2024 – ‘ramping up to 1000 packs in 2025.’ Sai Shivareddy, CEO at Nyobolt, said: ‘Unlocking the challenges faced by electric vehicle designers has been key to the development of our breakthrough fast-charging batteries. Previously, enabling a light weight fast-charging vehicle was not possible without compromising its lifetime and so people have been relying on costly and large battery packs in the vehicle. With our unique technology we have achieved a six-minute charge car, and developed smaller battery packs that can deliver more power and charge in less time. ‘Our partnership with CALLUM shows how adoption of system-level technology innovations can transform the future of electric vehicles and increase accessibility of EVs, including to the 40 per cent  of UK households who can’t charge their vehicle at home overnight.’ CJ is a former Associate Editor of CAR, and now runs parent company Bauer Media’s Digital Automotive Hub – the in-house team that provides much of the online content for CAR and sister site Parkers.co.uk as well as helping out with CAR magazine.

471,Special forces MAN van: Torsus Terrastorm gets even tougher,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/torsus/terrastorm-special-forces/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-02,Car Magazine UK,"Hardcore off-road van converter Torsus has revealed an updated version of its product line optimised for use by ‘special operations forces’. So if the A-Team – or the SAS – should need a new set of wheels, we’ve got just the people they should call… Based on the / MAN TGE large van platform, this latest variant of the Torsus Terrastorm has been developed in cooperation with Rheinmetall Military Vehicles (RMMV). It’s all a bit hush-hush, but the USP is adaptability, meaning it’s easy to equip the vehicle for specific missions, and even change priority on the fly. The demonstration example in the pictures isn’t super exciting in principle – the highlighted modification beyond all the usual Terrastorm off-road kit is a quick-change ‘Tarpaulin’ on the back of a flatbed body. This can convert from a covered vehicle protecting whatever specialist kit is being transported in the back to an open-bed pickup for ‘ultra-rapid access’ (to cargo and people) in ‘minutes’. The advantages to this are fairly obvious, but not exactly scenario altering. The pitch is the combination of this kind of adaptability with the existing Terrastorm off-road capability, while the partnership with RMMV means further specialist applications can be developed according to client demand. Torsus says its vehicle has ‘unmatched ability to operate with maximum effectiveness in any corner of the world, no matter how hostile the terrain, weather or geopolitical conditions.’ A selection of exploded diagrams demonstrate the chassis modifications made for this variant, which include a number of under-body protection panels as well as the upgraded JRZ suspension. As the self-styled creator of ‘world’s toughest off-road buses’ (especially the ), Slovakia-based Torsus takes agility and capability very seriously. So if it says the Crafter / TGE platform is a good choice for this while also underlining its reliability, we’re inclined to believe. There’s a certain logic to developing an OEM commercial vehicle product like this, too, as the base manufacturer has already done a huge amount of testing for fundamental durability and proven ergonomics. For similar examples, check out the we drove in 2023. The Terrastorm uses the vans’ 4×4 drivetrain, powered by a choice of twin-turbo 2.0-litre TDI engines. Which is to say you could have a puny 138bhp variant with 251lb ft of torque – but no self-respecting special operations force is going to want anything less than the 174bhp model with 303lb ft. Especially if opting for the 5-tonne gross vehicle weight variant instead of the regular 3.5t version; probably a wise choice if you’re going to be carrying a lot of heavy… kit. Both transmissions are offered, too, meaning you can have a six-speed manual or the smooth, efficient eight-speed auto also offered in these vans. And before anyone asks, Torsus does also sell the Terrastrom as a – as well as a minibus, a cargo van and even an ambulance. So if you want the ultimate in compact , you might soon be able to ask for the military package.

497,Stickin' to the master plan: why Jaguar’s standing by its bold EV trilogy,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/jaguar/formula-e-ev-strategy/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-07-24,Car Magazine UK,"The road to an all-electric future has become less of a motorway and more of a scenic B-road. Alongside government U-turns at home and away, huge players are all dusting down test benches and returning to ICE R&D – while simultaneously saying they never really left. It’s difficult enough for brands like Nissan and Toyota that have vast, multiple powertrain technologies at their disposal – but where does it leave a brand that just seemingly committed to an all-electric future? To find out we spoke to Rawdon Glover, the man leading Jaguar into its new, premium all-electric chapter. In many ways, Jaguar has no choice but to continue; simply because of the time scales involved with such a mammoth task. Its new three-car strategy and the JEA (Jaguar Electric Architecture) platform it’ll sit on has been years in the making – and it’ll be years in the doing too. Any platform decision is probably a 12–15-year decision, because you’ve got five, six years in the gestation and then you’ve got probably a maximum of eight, nine years to leverage the platform once you launch it.’ says Glover, over the din of thumping techno. We’re not talking in a nightclub, but in the quietest possible corner of the Formula E 2024 season finale. As it turns out that’s just next to Jaguar’s hospitality centre on the last corner of the circuit. ‘So, it’s not a short-term decision that you can flex mid midstream,’ he continues. The cat is mid-pounce, with its road car plan headed towards three EVs in the next three to four years – but, on track, things are already full EV. Jaguar has been there or thereabouts in Formula E for the last few years, winning the constructors’ championship this year, and only just missing out on the drivers’ championship. Both Mitch Evans and Nick Cassidy went into the last race with a chance to win, with both in position at certain parts. Before this, Jaguar’s last constructors’ championship came in the 1991 FIA sports car championship – winning with the Ross Brawn-penned, V12-powered, XJR-14. Put those stats together, and Jaguar’s racing transformation has already begun. But, back on the road, Jaguar is looking well past the here and now. ‘This platform has got to be the right thing for us well into the next decade. So, what we got to think about [is] not what is happening in 2024, [but] what is happening in the early part of 2030 – 2032. It’s going to basically last that time period,’ he adds. What’s more, the return to ICE is happening more amongst volume players (such as Volkswagen and Audi) side and bespoke supercar products (such as the or the seen below) – not where Jaguar’s new car will play: ‘We’re not going to be in the volume part of the market, which is probably most affected by what’s going on at the moment,’ Glover confirms. ‘The term I use this is discretionary spend; you don’t have to spend £110,000 pounds on a vehicle –  you do because you want to. ‘You do it because there’s that sort of that inherent demand for it. We’ve got to create that demand. To a certain extent, that’s agnostic to the platform and that’s the job that Jaguar needs to do. ‘It’s never about the powertrain first, it’s got to be about the design of the brand first, and then those good things come second.’ So how do you create a new vision and a new demand? First, you retire everything else – after all, you can’t create an all-new vision with last year’s work in the same gallery. Jaguar has already begun to sunset the rest of its range, but the rate of its deceleration can be managed to an extent. Think gentle EV regen rather than a devastating EV pile-up: ‘I think at an enterprise level, we’ll look at how we optimize that blend of full electrification, combustion engine and hybrid,’ said Glover, adding that it’ll only be a short to medium term solution with sales continuing to 2025 in certain markets. Glover was also keen to point out the support infrastructure for the current models would remain for years to come, with customers able to buy new Jaguars in 2024 with confidence. They’ll be supported, but they’ll look rather dated compared to Jaguar’s new trilogy. ‘It’s not about running them to side by side, we really need to close one chapter,’ Glover told us. ‘Then we have a period to prepare and generate demand for the next chapter. Then we’ll go live with the next chapter.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."

It’s a substantial revision of the first standalone Cupra model and can be seen as the mid-life facelift. Cupra is going all in on a new brand vision that centres around the value of design, signing sporting partnerships and devising clothing ranges to maximise its reach. The new Formentor is going to play a big part in the company’s development for the remainder of this decade, not least to achieve its goal of having a presence in the US by 2030. The 2024 Formentor facelift includes a new exterior design, an updated interior and fresh engine choices with engineering borrowed from elsewhere in the Volkswagen Group family. Don’t miss our review. Cupra’s kept to its home colours of dark greys and that distinctive copper, but there have been some major changes made in the way the Formentor looks. Let’s start with the front end – the Formentor has received a shark-nose-like redesign, along with new triangular LED headlights and revised intake slots. The end result is all angles and sharp edges – it’s quite an aggressive front end, with a bigger, heavily slatted grille that rounds off the pugnacious face. Around the back, the Formentor now presents ‘coast-to-coast’ headlights – connected by a single light bar that now includes an illuminated Cupra badge. In keeping with the design language of the headlights at the front, the taillights also feature three triangular elements, along with an illumination of the car’s name within the lights themselves. Yes, though perhaps not quite as evidently as the exterior. Much of the Formentor’s dashboard has been amended, including the centre console which has been streamlined in much the same style as in the latest compact and hatchback offerings from Audi and Volkswagen. Pushing an agenda of sustainability for the brand, the Formentor’s cabin now features fresh interior materials including 73% microfibre cloths around the doors and dashboard along with cow-friendly leathers. To round off the updated cockpit, a new and pretty enormous 12.9-inch infotainment screen is also available along with a 12-speaker Sennheiser sound system. The updated Formentor is sticking with at least some form of internal combustion across the board, though it will be available with a new generation of mild and plug-in hybrid engines. The petrols kick off with a 147bhp TSI from VW’s arsenal, paired with a six-speed manual. A mid-range 2.0-litre option is also available that produces 201bhp while the top-end models get 328bhp along with torque-splitting technology for the benefit of agility and cornering. There’s even a drift mode in sportier models… The mild-hybrid engines mate a 48-volt lithium-ion battery with the 1.5-litre TSI – DSG gearbox only – while the plug-in hybrid options offer two power outputs – 201bhp or 268bhp. According to Cupra, these plug-in hybrids, which are also mated to the 1.5-litre TSI, can run for up to 62 miles on electric power only. But don’t forget the chassis. It’s been enhanced to match the uprated powertrain performance and sportier looks, with freshly tuned spring and damper rates for a relaxed feel when needs be but also the dynamics when you turn things up. They’re complemented by MacPherson struts and a rear multilink system, while all-wheel drive variants are also available. These models feature technology that can straighten the car out by sending additional power to the appropriate wheel if you get out of shape – clever stuff.

472,Stealthy Jenoptik smart cameras that can spot drivers on their phone roll out across UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/jenoptik-safety-cameras/,Paula Cullington,2024-07-02,Car Magazine UK,"The latest generation of smart cameras is being rolled out across the UK, harnessing the latest AI tech to see what drivers are doing behind the wheel. Jenoptik VECTOR-SR safety camera surveillance technology can detect distracted drivers using their phones or not wearing a seatbelt. A government study analysed by Road Angel has revealed that a whopping 40,000 UK drivers could be caught and punished as authorities adopt the new technology. The National Highways trial began in 2021 and police forces have been using the technology to identify distracted drivers. Those caught received warning letters about the risks of their behaviour. Drivers will see the new camera technology rolled out on 25 routes in the north of England, following successful trials in Greater Manchester, Devon, Cornwall, and Wales. Transport Scotland has already signed a deal worth almost half a million pounds for installation across the road network around Glasgow and Edinburgh, with the rest of the UK set to follow. The cameras have been highly effective in catching speeding motorists across multiple lanes in both directions. Additionally, the VECTOR-SR doubles as a red-light camera and is capable of snapping motorists who aren’t wearing a seatbelt. Trials in Devon in 2023 saw four of the new cameras catch 3280 drivers for speeding in just two weeks. Unlike older models with their box-like structures, the new smart cameras are smaller, less noticeable and operate without needing road markings or a flash to catch unsuspecting drivers breaking the law. They’re remarkably stealthy. The advanced cameras capture footage of passing cars, snapping a selection of digital photos of the drivers. Images of motorists breaking the law are then passed on to the police for consideration and further action if necessary. If caught, drivers holding a handheld device behind the wheel could face six penalty points and a £200 fine, increasing to £1000 and a driving ban if taken to court.

473,Land Rover Defender OCTA: all the details on JLR's second 626bhp super SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/land-rover/defender-octa/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2024-07-03,Car Magazine UK,"We all know the score with Defenders, right? Virtually unstoppable off-road but not particularly fast if you’re traversing the countryside on a B road. Things have got much better with the current model, but it’s not something you’d drift around the Nurburgring at speed. But that’s exactly what the £145k OCTA has been caught doing during testing. It all starts with a very healthy boost in power, although not from Land Rover’s supercharged 5.0-litre found in the . Instead, it shares its BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo mild-hybrid V8 with the . It matches its maximum power of 626bhp and 553Ib ft – with 590Ib ft available in launch mode – to give 0-62mph in a blistering 3.8 seconds. That’s significantly quicker than the , and less than half a second slower than the . But the SV doesn’t just donate its engine, you also gain its ‘6D’ hydraulically interlinked adaptive dampers. These remove the need for conventional anti-roll bars by controlling pitch and roll, giving a far greater breadth of ability, as Jamal Hameedi, Director of SVO at JLR explains. Without the anti-roll bar you gain 119mm of suspension articulation off-road and the dampers provide far flatter cornering on it. New suspension arms increase width by 68mm and mean much wider arches, while ground clearance increases 29mm. Front and rear bumpers are redesigned to improve approach and departure angles, and there’s beefed-up underbody protection for extreme off-road situations. Tyre height grows to 33-inches (the same as a Ranger Raptor) with a choice of a road-focused 22-inch wheel with all season tyres, or optional forged 20-inch items. Tick the box for these and you’ve a choice of more hardcore off-road tyres. All-terrains drop the top speed from 155mph to 130mph, with the seriously knobbly advanced all-terrains lowering it further to 99mph. Regardless of tyre, 0-62mph takes 3.8-seconds. Having poked around a road-biased OCTA on 22s and one with the forged 20s, both have a more menacing presence than the regular Defender. The standard 110 – you can’t have a 90 or 130 OCTA – is wide, but this is even more mirror-filling. As for the wheels, the 22s don’t look bad, but the motorsport-inspired 20s just suit the OCTA perfectly. I’ll take mine in white, please. Unlike the G-Class that uses hardy coil springs, air springs are used in the Defender OCTA. To make sure these and the rest of the 4×4 are tough enough, time has been spent at locations popular with Dakar racers testing ensuring their durability. And why OCTA and not SV? Although it has the SV tech, Land Rover are keen to differentiate its ‘House of Brands’ despite the inevitable overlap. If you’re still wondering what OCTA actually means, it references a diamond’s octahedron shape – nature’s hardest material and also one of its most valuable luxury items. That explains the interior makeover with new seats and added plushness. It’s certainly a car that’s very different in purpose to the SV. While you can off road that, you’ll forever be worrying about giving it rock-turned wheel faces and reprofiled carbon fibre unless you’re very gentle. It’s best left to the road and the muddy pony club carparks. The OCTA? It’s the off-road hero that’s far better on road than it has any right to be. It takes the Defender away from slow and steady mud plugging and towards the high-speed stuff that the Raptors and TRXs of this world have made so appealing. With the OCTA badge, according to Land Rover, adorning ‘all future flagship Defender models,’ things just got very interesting.

Like most political parties, Labour’s manifesto was more concerned about fixing important national issues such as bolstering our struggling NHS, dealing with a rapidly accelerating climate crisis and organising a recovery plan for the highest rate of inflation the nation has seen for around 40 years. However, we thought it would be useful to compile a no-nonsense guide that outlined each party’s plans for UK drivers. Motoring policies are important because they affect such a massive portion of the electorate. According to the Office for National Statistics, 75% of people aged 17 and over held a full driving licence in 2022. That’s a huge swathe of the public. Now that Labour has won the election, we’ll open our guide on its policies. However, we’ve also included the other parties’ plans to give you an idea of what Labour’s rivals be shouting from the other side of the Commons. Below, we’ve summarised what each party’s plans were for drivers. Plus, because pictures of politicians are boring, we’ve headed each section with an image of a car, (painted in the corresponding party colour, naturally), doing a huge skid. We thought they’d add a splash of excitement to what’s quite a dry topic. Scroll down for some political journalism, CAR magazine style. Then, if you’re feeling particularly brave, let us know which party’s motoring policies resonate with you most in the comments below. Labour’s election campaign focused on five things: kickstarting economic growth, improving our clean energy industry, clamping down on crime, rebuilding the NHS and revising the country’s childcare and education systems to allow all young people to reach their potential irrespective of their class or economic status. That’s a lot for the party to worry about, but Labour still reckons it has time to implement some interesting motoring policies. The party’s biggest proposed change is to reinstate the , thus reversing the Tories’ decision to push it back to 2035. Labour also aims to introduce a fresh piece of legislation for second-hand . It’ll launch a new, standardised method of recording the health of used EV battery packs which the party says will help drivers make more informed buying decisions. Labour’s also considering how it can balance the country’s finances with its list of priorities. So, in its fiscal plan, the party states it’ll delay construction of the A27 bypass and reallocate that £65 million budget to repair up to 1 million potholes each year. The final issues the party hopes to address are the soaring cost of car insurance and the country’s as-yet unfinished EV charging infrastructure. However, the party is yet to provide a budget (or even an estimate) for either of these plans. The Tories proposed a rather thorough plan for Britain’s motorists – and their policies were quite tactically aimed. We reckon the party was trying to box clever by targeting the most controversial pieces of motoring legislation and offering to ‘fix’ the complaints they caused amongst drivers in an effort to drum up some support. The party kicked off with a pledge to spend a ‘record’ £8.3 billion on mending potholes and resurfacing roads – money it said would be spent before the end of the 2025 financial year. The Conservatives also said they’d cancel and reverse the . That latter policy helped the party win its by-election in Harrow, and it obviously thought the same trick would work on a national level. Evidently not. Other changes promised by the Tories included scrapping the and introducing a local referendum scheme to give residents the chance to contest all future 20mph zones. The lower speed limit was fiercely opposed in Wales and the Tories state that, although it can improve road safety in school zones and residential areas, it doesn’t suit every road to which it’s been applied. Another change the party proposed is a new Pumpwatch scheme that would have forced petrol retailers to share live pricing information, allowing drivers to easily find the best deal. Plus, the Tories hoped to make fly tipping an offence punishable with penalty points on the offender’s driving licence. The Conservatives also took the campaign trail as an opportunity to remind us of their new , which became law in May 2024. The new legislation will allow self-driving cars to hit our roads as soon as 2026. Additionally, the party said it would have remained committed to its promise to halt the construction of all new , had it stayed in power. Finally, like Labour, the Conservatives assured us they’ll bolster the UK’s . However, they never confirmed exactly how they planned to improve the network and how much the project would have cost under their control. The Liberal Democrats had a slightly different set of priorities. In addition to reforming our economy and repairing our public services, the party said it would  fix our relationship with the EU and tackle climate change. Cars were, obviously, a part of this latter plan – and the Lib Dems said they would have made some changes to our motoring habits. Electric cars played a big role in this plan. The party promised to ‘make it cheaper and easier for drivers to switch to electric vehicles’ – and to achieve this, it proposed a three-pronged policy assault. First, the party hoped to concentrate on infrastructure. It said it would have built more public charging points, including low-speed on-street residential chargers and high-speed rapid chargers at motorways service stations. Much like the Conservatives, though, it didn’t given an estimate for the cost of the project. The Lib Dems also pledged to cut VAT on public charging down to 5% and upgrade the National Grid to allow it to cope with the extra strain. In addition, the party said it would have reintroduced the and reverted the deadline for the ban on combustion engine cars from 2035 to 2030 (matching Labour). The party rounded off its motoring policies with a rather sweeping promise to ‘protect motorists from rip-offs,’ claiming it would have worked to control ‘unfair insurance and petrol prices.’ One of the ways the party aimed to achieve this was by expanding its Rural Fuel Duty Relief scheme, which would have seen drivers in areas such as Cornwall, Cumbria and Devon save 5p per litre at the pump. The Green Party proposed some bolder changes to Britain’s motoring landscape. First, the party was adamant that it would stop the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2027. That’s three years sooner than the date fixed by Labour and the Lib Dems. What’s more, the Greens announced they wanted to remove combustion engine cars from our roads by 2035. To hit this target, the Green Party mapped out a new scrappage scheme (for which almost every car on the road will be eligible for) and launch a fresh bout of financial support to help drivers afford a new electric car. Other proposed changes included a reformed road tax system that was proportional to the weight of the vehicle and a default 20mph speed limit in all built-up areas. Plus, the Greens pledged to spend an additional £19 billion over five years on upgrading the nation’s bus and rail services and ‘supporting electrification.’ The Greens stand firm on their policies about pollution, too. So, to trim our travel emissions, the party planned to oppose all new road-building plans and spend £2.5 billion per year on fresh cycleways and footpaths. The idea was to encourage people to step out of their cars and either walk or cycle for their local journeys. This policy also includes a scheme that would ‘reimagine’ how our residential streets are used. The Greens hoped to ‘reduce traffic’ and open the roads up for ‘community use.’ However, the party is yet to announce how the changes will be made and whether the people they affect will be polled for their opinion before they’re enacted. Reform UK gained a lot of support, claiming a 14.3% share of the vote. For context, the Lib Dems attracted a 12.2%. Reform’s campaign led on policies such as leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, freezing all non-essential UK immigration, rejecting any asylum claims that arrive through ‘safe countries’ and introducing a tougher, zero-tolerance policing strategy. The party’s aims for the transport sector were similarly daring. Within its first 100 days in office, Reform UK said it would scrap HS2 (which it claimed would save the country a chunky £25 billion). It also planned to cancel every low-emission zone and low-traffic neighbourhood in the nation, abandon the petrol and diesel car ban entirely and remove all legal requirements for car manufacturers to switch to making electric cars. Reform UK also hoped to immediately issue extraction licences to plum the North Sea’s gas and oil supplies, as well as reverse the UK’s Net Zero targets and bin its related subsidies.

475,What do you get if you cross a car with a helicopter? This unique Caterham Seven 360R,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/caterham/360r-raf-helicopter/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-05,Car Magazine UK,"y One-of-a-kind have become so common now they’re almost passe – but a one-of-a-kind Caterham Seven built using bits from an RAF helicopter? That we can get behind. Especially as the result is being auctioned to raise money for injured servicemen and women. Based on a , this unique project is equipped with components from – and very much inspired by – a Puma HC2 helicopter. Jointly created by Caterham and the Royal Air Force Force, it means the now retired XW232, which entered service in 1972, is heading for a second life as a fundraising initiative for and the . Not entirely. The aluminium skin from the Puma’s tail boom and doors has been repurposed to form several of this Caterham’s panels – with the finish remaining exactly as it was when it was removed from the aircraft. In fact, if you look at the internal rear bulkhead, you’ll find the door jettison handle has also been left in place. The rest of the 360R was then painted to match, including the underlying chassis – which is finished in ‘Desert Sand’ just as the aircraft is beneath the surface. On the inside, the Caterham’s doors are lined with quilted soundproofing taken from the Puma, as are the centre tunnel and the carbon fibre seats. The evacuation instructions stitched into the lining have also been preserved. The dashboard has received a unique satin black finish to match the repurposed military switchgear that replaces the usual interior controls. The chopper’s navigation clock is the centrepiece, while a special three-stage start-up sequence has been added to give this 360R an even greater sense of occasion. Not content with all that, the joint team of Caterham staff and serving personnel at RAF Benson (where XW232 was stationed) have even managed to use the Puma’s ammunition box as a battery holder under the bonnet. First of all it’s going on display in the Military Village at the at Silverstone. Then it’s going to be auctioned by – with the aim of raising more than £100,000 for charity. Bidding opens on 15 August 2024 – and ends on 15 September. The car is scheduled to appear at several more events over the summer.

476,Watch: we hitch a wild ride in the new Dacia Sandrider Dakar rally raider,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/dacia/sandrider/,Jake Groves,2024-07-06,Car Magazine UK,"Dacia is doubling down on its rugged, outdoorsy image – a strategy underlined by this, the new 2024 Dacia Sandrider race car. It’s a rough ‘n’ tough Dakar rally raider and we’ve hitched a lift during testing to experience the wild design and engineering first hand. Watch our exclusive film above, as head of video James Dennison meets its makers and holds on for dear life as the Sandrider shows off its extraordinary flight skills and trick suspension. Dacia revealed its 2025-and-beyond World Rally Raid and Dakar Rally contender at the . The brand, , says the new, tough off-roader is ‘a prototype designed to win’ and will run in the Ultimate T1+ FIA class. The new Sandrider’s design is heavily inspired by . In fact, Dacia’s chief designer of its Advanced Design division, Romain Gauvin, tells us the two cars were designed in parallel. ‘We absolutely did not want to take an existing production car like a or a or something and deform it on top of a Dakar chassis – it doesn’t make sense in terms of functionality,’ he says. ‘The Dakar project was under the radar for a bit of time, but when we started working on it we were also working on the Manifesto,’ adds Gauvin, ‘so they stem from the same movement – it was a good starting point.’ So much so that, like the Manifesto, Dacia says the only body panels fitted to the Sandrider are ones that are absolutely necessary. A lot of the car’s design development was aided by intel and guidance gathered by the upcoming Dacia team’s drivers. ‘We were directly in contact,’ Gauvin tells us. ‘The drivers and co-drivers have a very deep knowledge of their car, so they were great people to talk to in order to collect info on what it is they really need.’ Design details like a raked bonnet in order not to obstruct the driver’s field of view, as well as a magnetic plate for ensuring fixing bolts don’t get lost in the sand feature – influenced by the drivers and co-drivers. ‘Take the visibility for instance; having a few more degrees of visibility means they can anticipate more and feel safer, meaning you can take more risks to squeeze out a few seconds,’ says Gauvin. Dacia’s approach to keeping things simple has extended to aerodynamics and weight, too. Dacia claims that its focus on simplicity means the Sandrider is 15kg lighter as well as benefitting from reduced drag by 10 per cent and lift by 40 per cent ‘in relation to comparable prototypes.’ Anti-infrared pigments in the paint and special fabrics used inside are designed to reduce heat in the cabin. The Sandrider relies on a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 powertrain developing 355bhp and 398lb ft, with power sent to all four wheels via a six-speed sequential. Crucially, though, the Sandrider will run exclusively on synthetic fuel by Aramco. Three crews will drive the Sandrider in its first Dakar entry in 2025. The Dacia team will headlined by Sébastien Loeb and co-driver Fabian Lurquin, and will include Cristina Gutierrez Herrero and her co-driver Pablo Moreno Huete as well as Nasser Al-Attiyah and co-driver Mathieu Baumel. Development kickstarts as of now, including tests in several countries around the world. Dacia says the Sandrider’s motorsport debut will be at the Rallye du Maroc in 2024.

477,Rimac Nevera 15th Anniversary Edition celebrates firm's meteoric rise at Goodwood 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rimac/nevera/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-09,Car Magazine UK,"‘To celebrate 15 years of achieving the impossible’ – that’s how Rimac explains the purpose of the Nevera 15th Anniversary Edition. The latest version of this astonishing is heavy on the copper and congratulatory graphics (and why not, all things considered), just nine examples will be built. Each priced from 2,350,000 Euros. That’s just shy of £2m at current exchange rates. But while it’s sometime hard to care about these mega-money machines that may never even see a public road, the Rimac Nevera does feel like something worth celebrating. The anniversary in question is not the car. It’s not even the car . Rather it references the point in time when decided to rebuild his E30 BMW 3-series with electric power. In 15 short years since that moment, the resulting Rimac Group has risen to the point where it’s , and will be assisting BMW with the creation of its next-generation EV batteries. The continuing development of Rimac’s electric drivetrain technology has made it one of the most influential automotive brands in the world. ‘Honestly, when I started to tinker with my first car in a garage, I couldn’t have even dreamt of being where we are 15 years later,’ says CEO Rimac. ‘There were so many times in the early years that we really thought the company wouldn’t make it, so reaching the 15-year milestone felt like it was worthy of a celebration.’ He continues: ‘The 15th Anniversary Edition Nevera is the car that marks our progress, revelling [sic] just how far we’ve come. From garage to global; from worrying about keeping the lights on to a 2bn EUR valuation; from converted BMW 3-series to the world’s fastest accelerating production car and from hypercar maker to Tier 1 EV tech supplier and energy storage pioneers. All achieved in a country where all of this would have sounded like science fiction at the time of founding the company.’ Well, aside from being a variant of ‘the most powerful production car in the world’ – developed from the , the four-motor four-wheel drive system beneath that slinky body produces 1888bhp and 1725lb ft – it’s got a lot of copper going on. From the special paint on the outside to the anodised copper switch gear on the inside, this is all a deliberate reference to the importance of this metal in electric connections. The outside also gets a new visible carbonfibre splitter, two-tone wheels, Rimac circuit-board patterning and 15 Years Anniversary badging. On the inside, buyers can choose between black or white finishing, depending on how they prefer to set-off the copper accenting, plus 2009-2024 script on the centre armrest and 15 embossed into the headrests. The £2m price includes ‘all options’ and a set of matched luggage. The first customer car will be at the , where it will take to the hill – presumably not in too much anger… All that power would be useless without control, and the Nevera has what the company describes as a ‘supercomputer’ managing all its in-house designed control units and the 1MegaWatt inverter that makes the huge power distribution to each wheel possible. Rimac labels the whole thing Rimac All-Wheel Torque Vectoring 2. The Nevera has set 27 performance records – including the – and does 0-62mph in 1.81sec, 0-186mph in 9.22sec, and a top speed of 256mph. That makes it the . It also holds the Goodwood Festival of Speed production car record, completing the hillclimb in 49.32 seconds. The battery pack is 120kWh capacity, and the is a claimed 300 miles per charge. Though presumably not if you’re in a hurry. of up to 500kW are possible – which means 10-80 per cent in 19 minutes – but the fastest routinely available chargers are 350kW, which means you’ll need about 25 minutes for the same. Or just get the butler to pick it up in the truck when you’re juiced out. What a thing.

478,"New Renault Symbioz SUV: prices revealed, starts from under £30k",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/symbioz/,Seth Walton,2024-07-09,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has opened up its order books for the all-new Symbioz hybrid , a fresh combatant in its C-segment lineup, with prices starting from £29,295. The Symbioz is available in three trim levels, Techno being the most basic of the available options for the aforementioned figure. For that price, you get wireless phone charging, 18-inch wheels and a 10.4-inch OpenR Link touchscreen display as standard in your Techno car, but these are just a few highlights from an altogether generous standard equipment list. Techno Esprit Alpine cars are up next in the range. They feature 19-inch alloy wheels, a smattering of Alpine interior styling details and heated/electrically adjustable front seats over base-spec models, among other add-ons. A Techno Esprit Alpine Symbioz will set you back £31,295, while range-topping Iconic Esprit Alpine grade cars are priced at £33,295. These latter models come with a nine-speaker premium Harman Kardon sound system and Renault’s Solarbay: an opacifying glass sunroof that can be activated via voice control through baked-in Google software. It’s worth noting that Renault will not allow you to option up your Symbioz based on personal preferences. Features are locked in to their trim grade unless available on the next level up, so you can’t spec your Techno model with a Solarbay roof, for example. We’ll publish a full review of the Renault Symbioz next month. For now, though, read on for everything we know so far about the new Symbioz family SUV. Falling between the Captur and the Austral, the Symbioz represents the latest in a long lineage of spacious and practical Renault family vehicles, according to the manufacturer, that kicked off with the Renault 16 back in 1965. With a big, sun-lit cabin and class-leading boot space, the Symbioz has been primed to make waves in the C-Segment market, forming part of the smaller end of Renault’s five-strong offensive. We haven’t driven it yet, but our first impressions include that it appears well-built, has a plush interior and boasts an impressive amount of space in the back for bags and dogs. It’s also rumoured to be very competitively priced, so it could be a world-beater. Read on to find out everything we know about the new Renault Symbioz. At 4.41m long, it’s the second shortest in the Renault C-Segment family car lineup after the Megane (4.2m), sitting behind the Scenic (4.47m) in the middle of the range. Inside it feels as spacious as some of the bigger Renaults, a sense that’s no doubt enhanced by the Solarbay panoramic sunroof that can turn from transparent to translucent to opaque at the touch of a button. Eagle-eyed readers may spot a few styling cues shared with the facelifted Captur. In fact, the two models were developed in tandem with each other, the Symbioz having been conceived during Renault’s return to the drawing board for the Captur after the team identified a gap in the Renault range. ‘We have a hole in the middle (of the range). We wanted to introduce a new car that’s bigger than the Captur but cheaper than the Austral,’ design director Paula Fabregat told us. So, the blueprints for the Captur and the Symbioz were outlined together. They would share a similarly stocky rear-end already familiar to the Captur, while both would receive a thickset and straight-bonneted front end with thin sleek headlights to establish a new design language for Renault. The Symbioz is longer than the other car, but at 1.6m tall, it still retains an air of C-Segment compactness from the rest of its siblings, sharing a largely similar rear end with the Scenic, only a bit lower. The Symbioz will be launched with just one power unit on offer: the four-cylinder, 141bhp hybrid E-tech engine and 36 kw electric motor familiar to the Austral and the Arkana. This power unit gets going in all-electric when setting off  – a mode Renault says can be prolonged for up to 80% of the time when driving in urban environments – while during motorway driving, the combustion engine drives the wheels directly. Renault claim it should be capable of an mpg figure in the low sixties, aided by the Symbioz’s E-Save button also found in the New Clio and Captur. This button ensures the battery has a constant charge of at least 40% so the car may be able to traverse steeper rises without losing speed. Anyone who’s daily-d a Renault over the last few years will likely feel at home in the Symbioz right away. It feature’s the brand’s typical large, portrait style 10.4-inch infotainment display in the middle of the dashboard, alongside the car’s larger-than-most steering wheel. As for the infotainment itself, the Symbioz includes an OpenR Link multimedia system with Google built-in – including Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play – as standard across the range. There’s an air of restraint and composure to the way the cabin has been designed, but that’s expected for a car of this sort. Renault has offered three trim levels for us Brits: techno, techno esprit Alpine, and iconic esprit Alpine. The top two of them feature their own upholstery layouts, along with accents from the racier sub-brand now common among top-end Renaults. The cabin has clearly been designed with practicality as a high priority. The rear bench can slide by 16cm to maximise either rear passenger leg room or boot space depending on what owners need more of at any given time. With the bench positioned all the way back, rear passengers will be able to enjoy 221mm more knee room while the boot has a capacity of 492 litres. With the bench all the way forward (sorry rear-bench riders) the boot capacity extends to 624 litres. With the rear seats folded, the capacity grows to 1582 litres. The Symbioz has an electric rear tailgate with a hands-free opening system, but the real star of the show – as already mentioned – is undoubtedly the Solarbay opacifying glass sunroof, first found on the Rafale and Scenic E-Tech electric. The system uses Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal that reacts to an electric current when passed through. The results are four sunroof opacity options: fully transparent, fully opaque, transparent front and opaque rear or vice versa. It’s a bit of a spectacle, and certainly helps to give the Symbioz a contemporary feel. We haven’t been given an exact figure yet, but CAR understands it could start from under £30,000. Though we haven’t spent very long in the car, our first impressions suggest that would make it very good value for money. We’ll report back here once we know exactly how much the Symbioz will be. Don’t confuse the 2024 model with the large, grand-touring from 2017 (below). That car was fully electric and designed to plug into the home grid (hence being pictured inside a swanky modern house). Over to Renault to explain the semantics of its new model name: ‘Symbioz borrows from the French word “symbiose”, derived from the ancient Greek “symbiosis”, meaning “living together”. This is a value deeply rooted in the DNA of Renault, with the brand committed to producing vehicles that completely fulfil the mantra of “cars for living”. ‘It is a word that is similar in many languages: “symbiosis” in English, “simbiose” in Spanish and “simbiosi” in Italian, making the name Symbioz easy to understand for a wide audience.’ Seth is a former staff writer across all our modern motoring titles, including CAR magazine and Parkers.

479,Ariel Nomad 2: second-gen on-road / off-road hilarity machine breaks cover,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ariel/nomad-2/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-09,Car Magazine UK,"So, you’ve got a – that’s cute; Ariel has developed a second-generation Nomad, and it would appear to take the whole lifestyle all-roader thing to an entirely different level. Officially labelled the Ariel Nomad 2, the extent to which this has been re-engineered compared with the original is rather extraordinary. In fact, we found ourselves chuckling the whole way through the official literature as yet another juicy detail was revealed. They’ve done ? Of course it’s got that now. And, why wouldn’t you want one of options? Looking somewhat like a Tonka Toy version of the , the Nomad 2 shows every sign of being one of those brilliantly British blends of madness and genius. Let’s go for the chassis – which is now formed from larger tubes, powder-coated in the colour of your choice, and 60 per cent more torsionally rigid than the original. The wheelbase is longer, the openings to get in and out are larger, and the whole thing functions as a roll cage to which various accessories can be bolted. These include mountings for a couple of bikes, a spare wheel or waterproof luggage; the inevitable light bar; and a pair of removeable illuminated whips for more serious off-road adventures. The scoop on the roof feeds air to the engine and the intercooler – separately – and has been optimised using computational fluid dynamics. Filtration is similarly dialled to the max avoid engine contamination; there’s even a ‘vacuation’ system to remove moisture and dirt, and the option of WRC-spec filtration material. The panels you can see are – like the original – made from the same material as traffic cones. Which is the equivalent of saying they’re basically indestructible. Option the Warn Axon winch and you get a special bumper and matching rear bar, plus additional underbody protection. It might not look like it, but the whole car has been aerodynamically considered as well. The Nomad 2 uses an Ariel-tuned version of the 2.3-litre turbo engine that’s more familiarly found in the . This comes with a choice of three maps that can be adjusted on the fly. Stage one is 260bhp / 284lb ft, stage two is 302bhp with 333lb ft, while stage 3 releases the full 305bhp and 382lb ft – the last doesn’t sound like much of a upgrade over the middle setting, but Ariel says torque is ‘considerably’ increased right across the rev range. With a kerbweight of just 715kg, the result is 0-60mph in 3.4sec and 134mph – though Ariel doesn’t say if those figures are with the standard six-speed manual or the optional paddle-actuated six-speed Quaife sequential. Amusingly, you can also option the Nomad 2 with a hydraulic handbrake; Ariel wryly says this is for off-road use only. Speaking of going off-road, the Nomad 2 runs unequal length double wishbone suspension and outboard coilovers. It has more travel than before, and a set of approach and departure angles many dedicated off-roaders can only dream of: 48 and 64 degrees, respectively. The longer wheelbase (+48mm) and wider track (+50mm), together with revised geometry that includes anti-squat and anti-dive considerations, promises an even more rounded driving experience than before – though perhaps also less of the lurid angles that looked so good in the previous photography. Grip, especially off-road, is said to be enhanced, and the steering, just two turns lock-to-lock, claims improved precision and communication thanks in part to castor adjustments. Because of course it does, Ariel offers three different choices of spring and damper. Standard are specially made K-Tech aluminium dampers with Eibach dual-rate springs. Three-way adjustable Ohlins TTX with remote reservoirs are next-up, with two-stage full-race Bilsteins offered for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. Similarly, there are three wheel options: standard 16s, forged 18s and beadlock 16s for the really rough stuff. Tyre choice ranges from everyday to extreme off-road to trackday specials – ‘covering the broad spectrum of Nomad 2 use scenarios’ says Ariel. The brakes are 40 per cent bigger, offer the option of front-rear bias adjustment from inside the cockpit and have ABS calibrated for off-road use, as is the cockpit-controlled launch and traction control system. Ariel uses stainless steel braided lines for the brakes and the clutch as standard. Well, the price – which starts at £67,992 including VAT. But there are over 100 options, so no two of these are likely to be identical. Each is built from the ground-up by a single technician, and Ariels typically hold their value incredibly well, so think of it not as expensive but an investment. The interior is a hose-out affair with no material trimming at all, and the Nomad 2 comes with a full data-logging system as well as a specially built TFT instrument cluster by AIM Technologies. There’s also a reversing camera; don’t laugh – if you’ve done the harnesses up properly, as you really should in one of these, you won’t be able to turn around to look over your shoulder. Besides, the engine intake and other gubbins are immediately behind you. Final word goes to Ariel director, Simon Saunders: ‘Making lightweight cars handle compliantly and comfortably on the road is an artform as suspension loads and forces are so low. Making the same car capable of reliably and repeatedly jumping the crest of an off-road hill at more than 100mph takes this to another level. If you then add in loose surfaces, mud, water, and perhaps some ice, you’ll appreciate the extremes that we have dealt with. ‘The Nomad 2 is, even to us, a truly remarkable car.’ Having spent several month living with a first-generation , you know what? We believe him… The all-new Ariel Nomad 2 makes its public debut at the on Thursday 11 July.

480,Audi ponders Brussels plant closure; threatens future of Q8 e-Tron,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/brussels-plant/,Jake Groves,2024-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has announced it is formulating a plan for the future of its electric car manufacturing plant in Brussels, which could result in its closure ‘if no alternative is found.’ The brand says it is ‘witnessing a global decline in customer orders in the electric luxury class segment,’ which is drastically affecting its production of the SUV and Sportback models that are manufactured at the Belgian plant. Audi’s operations in Brussels have seen significant changes and investment over the years as it had been ramping up its EV manufacturing to help its transition to making more electric vehicles. However, demand for electric cars has slumped in recent months, resulting in a vast drop in the plant’s productivity. Given the plant’s tight confines and location to the city centre of Brussels, Audi is also citing inflexibility in terms of how to alter how the factory operates as another reason for thinking the unthinkable. ‘The announcement of the intention does not mean that a decision has been made. Nevertheless, this news has been felt very profoundly by the employees in Brussels and by me too. A transparent and constructive dialog is important in the process that will follow. We will take all perspectives into account,’ says Volker Germann, CEO of Audi Brussels. ‘The employee representatives of AUDI AG are calling for long-term prospects for the plant and our colleagues in Brussels. Audi management must take responsibility for the site. We hope that a viable and sustainable solution will be reached in the course of the consultation process that has now been initiated,’ adds Rita Beck, spokesperson for the Audi Committee in the European VW Group Works Council. The news feeds into a wider trend we’re seeing in the car industry. After dramatic investment into electrification, some brands are stepping back as demand slumps. Volkswagen Group has announced Premium Platform Combustion to sit alongside its Premium Platform Electric (which underpins cars like the and ), and rivals like Mercedes-Benz are drastically altering their powertrain plans. Audi is in the middle of deciding how to proceed with its Brussels plant. As well as the potential of stopping production of the Q8 e-Tron early, the plant’s closure could result in serious consequences for the circa-3000 skilled employees at the facility.

481,Islands in the sun: meet the new Ford Capri,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/capri/,Seth Walton,2024-07-10,Car Magazine UK,"Yep, it’s back. Meet the new Ford Capri, a fresh market entrant with a name plate steeped in history… and expectation. If you’re wondering whether the real 2024 Capri is in fact hiding behind the coupé SUV you see before you, it’s not. The last Ford model to bear the name was a fastback European muscle car – slow slung, and hell-bent on injecting a tonic of working class heroism to the rivieras of southern Europe, but this one takes the moniker somewhere else. Ford has revived the name for a family SUV, and not only that, but it’s also fully electric, too. Nostalgia by name, zeitgeist by nature. ‘Bringing back a legend as revered as the Ford Capri is a big deal,’ Ford Blue and Model E boss Jon Williams said. ‘We’re excited that the new all-electric Capri is ready to bring some swagger to the world of EVs and introduce a whole new generation of drivers to the spirit of a cult classic.’ So, it’s a family SUV, and one that’ll likely feel more at home between supermarket carparks than on its island namesake, but what else do we know about the new Ford Capri? Read on for everything you need to know from CAR. That’s right, the new Capri is fully electric and will only ever be fully electric. It’ll be offered in two trim levels (more on that later) and with a choice of two electric motors: a 282bhp version with a range of 389 miles and a souped-up 335bhp power train with a range of 367 miles, according to WLTP. The two can clear 0-62mph in 6.4 seconds and 5.3 seconds respectively, while both have a torque rating of 545 Nm and a top speed of 111mph. The quoted WLTP electric ranges depend on spec, but still, they bode well for the car as pretty impressive figures. The Capri will also be available in rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive depending on which box you tick. With a kerb weight of between 2098kg and 2190kg depending on which model you go for, the new Capri is heavy by the standards of most ICE cars. Relative to its class, however, it’s about where we’d expect it to be. The Skoda Enyaq Coupe varies in weight from just under 2100kg to nearly 2200kg based on spec, so the Capri is within the right ballpark. I’ve had a sit in the new Capri, and I can report that its interior blends a slightly unconventional mix of sleek modernism and cheap practicality. The dashboard is dominated by a large, 14.6-inch display down the centre console, flanked by gloss plastic or a carbon fibre-look thread stitch either side and below. The rest of the dash is then made up of hard/semi hard scratchy plastics, creating an altogether upmarket utilitarian feel about the cabin’s front. The scratchy materials also extend into the door frames and the rear. Ford Capri unveiled. I’ve had a go at sliding its screen around. There’s plenty of headroom all the way to the rear and the seats are – from my albeit limited experience of sitting in them – very comfortable. The Capri Ford had at the mercy of my poking around was finished with quilted leather seats both front and rear, supplementing a bit more of a premium feel to counter-act the plastics of the dash. So far, we know that the new Capri will be available in two trim levels: Capri and Capri premium. Capri, the cheapest and most basic of the two, includes a massaging driver’s seat, an adjustable 14.6-inch centre screen and 19-inch alloys to name a few features. Capri Premium adds ambient lighting, a hands-free tailgate and an uprated sound system into the mix. A panorama sunroof will be standard on the latter. A host of driver assistance features will also be fitted as standard on all cars. These include reverse brake assist, intelligent adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning to name a few. A heads up display and a 360-degree camera are also available as part of Ford’s Driver Assist Pack. We don’t know how much the new Capri will cost yet – we expect something in the region of £40,000 to £50,000, mind – nor exactly when it’s going on sale, but we’ll update this page with the relevant information as soon as we find out.

482,Polestar Concept BST: beast-mode Polestar 6 revealed at Goodwood 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/polestar/concept-bst/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"If someone from the Polestar PR team hadn’t already predicted that headline we’ll be very surprised – and although we hate to be predictable, it’s also hard to get away from that fundamental truth. In Polestar-world, BST is short for ‘beast’, and the Polestar Concept BST imagines how future high-performance variants from this upstart might look. Making its global debut at the , the Concept BST certainly isn’t short of eye-catching details. Steady on, there’s a lot to unpack in that statement. But essentially, yes. The Concept BST is based on the , which had ambitions to be the first-ever electric convertible but isn’t due to reach showrooms until 2026 – and as such has been beaten to that particular punch by the . The initial run of 500 Polestar 6 models did also sell out within a week of being announced. However, the 6 is destined to be a regular production model rather than a limited edition (like the ), so you still have some chance of getting your hands on one. Though if the rumoured six-figure price is anything to go by, you’ll need to be very keen anyway. Since MG won the electric drop-top race, the Concept BST is at least an opportunity to grab some additional attention for the new production model. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath has this to say on that subject: ‘This car is a demonstration of how far we can push our performance brand – Polestar turned up to 11 if you will – and a demonstration of how we could apply the BST formula to our line-up in the future.’ At a dinner on the eve of Goodwood 2024 he further explained that Polestar was already recognised for its typically ‘cool and sophisticated’ Scandinavian design. With the Concept BST ‘we wanted to show that Swedes can actually be quite loud!’ There have already been a couple of , so it seems very likely we will be seeing more of this. Don’t get us wrong – the Polestar Concept BST is a great-looking machine. But the performance formula isn’t anything especially unusual here. Under the circumstances, you can understand Polestar not wanting to be too radical, however. And the whole thing is very cohesively done. The design team has taken the Polestar 6 and added bigger wheel arches to accommodate 22-inch forged alloy wheels and a wider track. There’s an aggressive front splitter and a whacking great rear-wing on the back, complete with the now de rigueur swan-neck mounting. The bonnet is vented for aerodynamic purposes, too. Even the silver paint is pretty basic race car, with only very subtle amounts of detailing in Swedish Gold, while Polestar describes the stickers as ‘racing-livery inspired’. It’s part , part hardcore , but we do like the rakish roadster side graphic created by that angled window line. The crease over the rear wheel arches that intersects with the corner at the top of the rear lights is rather lovely, too. It is a fine piece of automotive sculpture to set eyes on. Which visitors to the main Polestar stand at the Festival of Speed will be able to do.

483,"The 2024 MG HS - still cheap, now more cheerful",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/hs/,Tom Webster,2024-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"The all-new version of the MG HS SUV has been revealed, offering more space and an increased electric-range from its . This is the second generation of the brand’s , and this version is following a similar approach to that taken by the first model. While the main concept remains the same, there are some notable changes. This version has grown in most directions, being wider and longer, courtesy of a stretched wheelbase that has grown by 45mm. It’s fractionally lower than before, but provides more space inside. Other tweaks on the outside include the adoption of the latest MG design language – the one first used on the MG 3 hatchback – that sees slimmer headlights, a totally redesigned grille and a repositioned MG badge. There are big changes at the rear, too, with a completely new light structure and lighting feature that runs right across the back of the car. Up front in the cabin there are now two high-definition displays, both measuring 12.3-inches. The central one is dedicated to infotainment. There’s the now expected Apple Carplay and Android Auto, but MG also promises built-in connectivity with live navigation services such as traffic updates, weather information, and Amazon Music. The range-topping Trophy model also has a 360-degree around-view camera, and all versions come with wireless phone charging. The second screen gives you a choice of three modes – Map, Digital or ADAS – and they cycle through the sort of information you might want up in front of you. Think navigation or a really basic display of the driving info. Other changes up front include a new steering wheel, a changed gear shifter and what MG calls new quality materials. MG promises there is more space for people and luggage in the HS, but it only puts a figure on the increase in boot space. The capacity has increased by 44 litres which takes it up to a maximum of 507 litres, presumably for the petrol version. In the rear it says that the wider exterior allows for greater comfort, while there are more storage spaces throught the cabin, too. The MG HS takes the same approach in its engine offering as the first generation, with a choice between petrol and a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It is the latter that has the biggest upgrade, though, with a much larger battery than before. It is a 24.7kWh unit, which provides an electric-only range of up to 75 miles – a big step up from the official 32 miles of the first generation. This is paired with a 140bhp 1.5-litre petrol engine and a 207bhp electric motor that results in a 0-62mph time of 6.8 seconds. There will also be a 167bhp 1.5-litre petrol engine that comes with a choice of 6-speed manual of 7-speed automatic gearboxes. This manages 0-62mph in 9.6 seconds. Of course. There are two versions, SE and Trophy and it is the Trophy that gets most of the new stuff. Highlights of the additions are a 360-degree surround view camera, powered tailgate, that infotainment connectivity and wireless smartphone charging. There is a new set of 19-inchalloys too. The whole range gets a load more driver aids, too, including adaptive cruise, rear-cross-traffic alert and traffic jam assist. One thing that has continued is MG’s competitive approach to pricing. The petrol SE model starts at £24,995 while the PHEV kicks off at £31,495. Upgrading to Trophy adds £2500 in both cases. Both are available to order now but the petrol will head out first, arriving from the end of July. The PHEV follows on in September.

484,Maserati celebrates 20 years of racing with Icona and Leggenda editions at Goodwood,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/maserati/mc20/,Jake Groves,2024-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"Maserati’s Icona and Leggenda editions of its rather sweet MC20 supercar have been unveiled at Goodwood as the brand celebrates 20 years since it returned to motorsport. The MC20 Icona is designed to look much like the livery seen on the MC12 Stradale – the Ferrari Enzo-based supercar that propelled Maserati back into supercar-dom in the mid-2000s. The MC20 Icona model features an Bianco Audace Matte and Blu Stradale livery with chromed wheels and blue brake calipers. With the Leggenda edition, this particular model of MC20 is finished in the same colours as the Vitaphone Racing MC12 GT1 – the race car that won multiple 24 Hours of Spa events. Both models feature monocoque racing seats upholstered in colours that match their exterior, and they both come with a plaque to note that they’re just one of 20 of each build. Other bits of equipment on these models include an electronic limited-slip diff, carbonfibre interior trimmings and more. These editions come after Maserati launched its first MC20 edition: the Notte. That means ‘night’ in Italian – so it’s rather unsurprising that the car’s completely murdered out with matte black paint, black 20-inch alloys, black brakes and black interior upholstery. Production is limited to just 50 units worldwide. Apart from the stealth fighter paint job, though, the Notte is identical to the standard MC20. That means it’s powered by the company’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 engine, which churns out 621bhp and 538lb ft of torque. That’s enough for a 0–62mph time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 202mph. If Batman had need for a supercar, we reckon this would be high on his list. The Notte follows on from the MC20 Cielo. It’s a convertible version of the supercar that was unveiled in the middle of 2022 – and for all those that haven’t been keeping on top of their Duolingo lessons, its name means ‘sky’ in Italian. And it isn’t just pretty. It’s clever, too. Its glass roof can be retracted in just 12 seconds at speeds of up to 25mph and it features fancy ‘polymer-dispersed liquid crystal’ technology that allows the panel to turn opaque at the touch of a button, much like available on the Taycan. You pay a 65kg weight penalty for the convertible roof but, crucially, Maserati says interior storage remains unchanged. Maserati has been quite busy of late, building up a portfolio of sensible saloons and SUVs to entice the masses into PCP deals. But if it wants to flog its finance deals successfully, it needs a good advertising strategy. So, what’s the best course of action? That’s right – a bonkers, beautiful and completely bitchin’ flagship supercar designed specifically to get up Ferrari’s nose. As flagships go, the MC20 ticks all the boxes and then some. When Maserati launched the car, it said it was its time to be audacious and that sounds about right to us. After all, a return to the supercar market after a 16-year break with a carbon fibre-tubbed, £180,000+ coupe/convertible and a Maserati-derived V6 or electric powertrain and diagonal doors does smack of audacity. The truth is Maserati needs to be audacious to step out of Ferrari’s shadow. Behind the amazing figures and surprise powertrains, the MC20 is more than a halo car. It’s a rebirth for the brand. It spells a surprise return to motorsport for Maserati. The MC in the supercar’s stands for Maserati Corse (or ‘Maserati Racing’ in English) – and the brand unveiled a race-prepped version of the car in the final round of the 2023 Fanatec GT2 European Racing Series, where it fought through the pack to claim a spot on the podium. Maserati is now preparing the car to compete in the entire 2024 series. Maserati hasn’t confirmed much about it yet, probably because it isn’t due to go on sale until 2024. We know it’ll be called the MC20 Folgore (which means ‘lightning’ in Italian) and we suspect it use similar electric technology found in the . That car features a 92.5kWh battery pack and three electric motors pumping out a whopping 751bhp. If the motors find their way into the MC20’s super lightweight carbon fibre chassis, that’ll be a recipe for some serious speed. The battery might be a little too large for the MC20’s dainty frame, but we’re still expecting a maximum range of between 230 and 250 miles. Maserati has told us that the switch to electric power won’t dramatically affect the MC20’s styling, either. Back in 2020, the company teased us with some images of the supercar’s naked tub with some electrical gubbins in the rear – and it doesn’t look like the company’s engineers had to make merry with the angle grinder and the gaffer tape to make it fit. Plus, because Maserati is so desperately Italian, it even managed to make the EV bits look quite pretty. Well, the most astute readers will notice the MC20 doesn’t have a huge wing jutting out of its rear end, which might seem like a brave decision considering the driver has 621bhp under foot. Maserati ditched a massive rear wing for a much smaller spoiler that apparently enhances the up-washing generated by the floor, while increasing the downforce. The firm’s boffins spent over two-thousand hours in Dallara’s wind tunnel to arrive at that point. So, just trust that it works, okay? All those man-hours have paid off, though – the lack of a massive chav wing has kept the MC20’s styling pure. It looks stunning in the metal, partly because it isn’t entirely obvious how Maserati has tried to prevent it from killing its occupants the first time the car approaches a corner. It’s obvious once you wrap your head around the car’s colour scheme, though. It’s split into two sections – a painted section on the top and a naked carbon fibre bit at the bottom. The top of the car’s all about form, while everything below the wheel nuts is pure function. There’s a plethora of air intakes and ducts hiding in the panelling, all of which are designed to channel air under the car and suck it into the tarmac. And just look at the state of that rear diffuser. It looks like it could create enough downforce to keep a Typhon fighter jet fixed to the tarmac. It’s almost practical too. Behind the seats, there’s enough room for two aircraft cabin bags – and you get two boots! There are 47 litres of space hiding under the bonnet and further 101 litres lurking in the luggage compartment behind the engine. The MC20’s cabin is as thoroughly modern as the rest of the car. Maserati describes it as essential, functional and rational, which we think is fair enough. It looks purposeful, but it doesn’t feel stingy. You get carbon fibre seats and a thick steering wheel developed by Maserati test driver and former MC 12 racer, Andrea Bertolini. The wheel only has the essentials (for a supercar, at least). That means only basic volume and phone controls, along with a start and launch control button. The rear-view mirror is rather odd, too. It works and looks like a normal rear-view mirror but, because the view out of the back is so restricted, it’s connected to a camera mounted at the rear of the car and can also display a digital image of the traffic behind you. On the centre console, there’s a rotary drive mode switch that’s styled like a watch, which we assume this was designed to appeal to influencers’ magpie-like attraction towards to shiny things. Through this, drivers can toggle traction control, throttle, gearshift, and turbo boost maps in four different driving modes. We’ve outlined them below. Engine boost: normal Pedal sensitivity: normal Active exhaust valve: open above 5,000rpm Gear shift: slow and smooth Suspension: soft T/C: normal Engine boost: limited Pedal sensitivity: normal Active exhaust valve: open above 5,000rpm Gear shift: slow and smooth Suspension: soft T/C: all controls on Engine boost: normal Pedal sensitivity: low resistance, high sensitivity Active exhaust valve: open above 3,500rpm Gear shift: fast and direct Suspension: stiff T/C: some controls deactivated Engine boost: maximum Pedal sensitivity: low resistance, extremely sensitivity Active exhaust valve: always open Gear shift: racing Suspension: racing T/C: racing, with launch control available to use via steering wheel Everything off. Basically Corsa but with traction control completely deactivated. Sadly, we can’t even write about a supercar in 2023 without mentioning its infotainment system. Despite its minimalist interior, the MC20 features a 10.25-inch infotainment screen with a Wi-Fi hotspot. Maserati’s phone app can also keep you updated on the car’s fuel and oil levels, as well as tyre pressures and the usual array of tracking features. It works with Google and Alexa smart speakers, too, making it perfect for the sort of adenoidal supercar driver who likes to bark facts about their car to anyone they’re entertaining. But what’ll really excite the anally retentive types is that Maserati will send owners a monthly email report detailing information about the condition of the car’s engine, brakes and suspension. Lastly, Maserati has hit another first with the MC 20. It was the first car equipped with a premium-sound system from Italian firm Sonus. We’re struggling to see the point, though. Call us crazy, but we’d much rather listen the to the engine’s pistons battering squashed dinosaurs. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

485,Goodwood Festival of Speed 2024: the cars to look out for,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/goodwood/festival-of-speed/2024/,Ted Welford,2024-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"The Goodwood Festival of Speed has become the go-to event on the UK’s motoring calendar. From watching F1 drivers tackle Goodwood’s infamous hillclimb to seeing pre-war cars spitting flames and the greatest rally cars taking on a dedicated stage, the Festival of Speed (FOS) is quite a spectacle. Goodwood is also increasingly used by manufacturers to show off and reveal their newest metal, and 2024 is no different, with a range of important world debuts or cars being seen in public for the first time. Here’s a full preview as well as key information about how to get there and how you can still get your hands on tickets. Alfa Romeo is returning to supercar territory and it’s doing this with the . Limited to just 33 units, the lucky few choosing it have the option of 3.0-litre twin-turbo petrol power or having it as an EV. While revealed in August 2023, the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed is the first time the 33 Stradale will have been seen outside of Italy. Alfa Romeo’s new will also be on show at the the West Sussex festival. Aston Martin is really embracing the limited-run specials at the minute and the latest is the Valiant – a more track-focused variant of the What gives it further prominence is that it was originally commissioned by Fernando Alonso as a collaboration between the double-world champion and Aston Martin’s Q Division. The is the real deal, with a 735bhp 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12, manual gearbox and rear-wheel-drive. It makes its global debut at the FOS and will even be driven by Alonso up the 1.16-mile hillclimb on the Friday. BMW tends to chuck everything it’s got at Goodwood and this year is no different, with a host of new metal set to be at the FOS, including its , M135 and facelifted M2. But the most important car there will be the just a couple of weeks after its first reveal. Now using a plug-in hybrid set-up, it’s proven controversial with its sheer heft – it now weighs 2.4 tonnes, 500kg more than its predecessor – and with slightly worse performance on paper. Regardless of your thoughts, it will be your first chance to catch it in person at the Festival of Speed. Ford’s latest skunkworks project is the , devised after-hours by engineers that had the idea of conquering European sports car makers with its typical muscle car. Inspired by the Blue Oval’s GT3 cars, it’s designed for the track but can be homologated for the road. Ford really is going for territory with its new Mustang, and it will make its UK debut at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed. Set to be priced from £315,000, the GTD will be very limited in numbers with Ford currently taking applications via a dedicated website. tends to go all in at Goodwood and this year’s event is no exception as it expand its range of sporty models as part of a new ‘Magma’ program. There’s expected to be a sporty version of every model it sells in the future, with the firm kicking things off with a hotter version of the , as well as a G80 Magma and a G70 Nurburgring ‘ring taxi’. All of these will be heading up the Goodwood hill over the weekend, all painted in an unmissable fluorescent orange colour. One of the biggest surprises at this year’s Festival of Speed comes Honda’s confirmation that the . The Japanese firm has increasingly been focusing on SUVs in recent years, so its announcement that it will produce a new sports car, albeit a hybrid one, is welcome. Previewed by this concept version, it’s expected to arrive in production looking almost unchanged, and will likely use the same hybrid setup as found in the excellent , albeit hopefully with an extra helping of power. One of the latest restomods to hit the scene is the – a modern take on the Mercedes 190 E 2.5-16 Evo II, a homologation car produced out of its period DTM racer. Based on a standard 190 E chassis, it is pretty much stripped back entirely and everything you see here is new. Just 100 will be produced, each priced from an eye-watering €714,000 (£602,000). It’s made quite a commotion already and the HWA EVO will make its UK debut at the Festival of Speed followed by a range of other European events across the summer. Classis 000 is also being auctioned later this month by RM Sotheby’s. The has proven a huge success since it was revived in 2020 and Land Rover has continued to push the extremes of this SUV, including with a 5.0-litre V8 engine under the bonnet. But it goes a step further with the , which makes its dynamic debut at the FOS just a week after its reveal on 3 July. Using a BMW-sourced  626bhp 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine, it uses Range Rover Sport SV tech to take this SUV to a new dimension. In the world of drifting, Mad Mike is one of the top dogs. Renowned for his crazy builds, he’s taken things up a level by creating a drift car based on a £1.25m Tuned by renowned McLaren experts Lanzante, based closeby to Goodwood, they were a set a 100-day build challenge to complete the P1 ready for the Festival of Speed where Mad Mike will be taking it up the famous hill, and likely in style. Lanzante will also reveal the latest version of its ‘Tag Championship’, which is a 930-generation 911 Turbo with the engine out of an ’80s Formula 1 car. It’s every bit as wild as it sounds. Maserati is marking 20 years since its return to motorsport with the MC12 at the FOS with the reveal of two of its MC20 sports car. Called the Icona and Leggenda, just 20 of each will be produced. The electric GranCabrio Folgore will also be on show in the UK for the first time ahead of a launch later in the year. MG is going big at the FOS this year and will even have the famed central sculpture in front of Goodwood House for the first time as it marks its centenary year. As well as the , its headline act is the – a hardtop coupe version of its electric sports car, the . Something a bit more conventional from MG makes its debut here, too: the new . This generation gets a fresh design and updates to the hybrid and PHEV models, with the latter managing up to 75 miles of e-range. It will also reveal a new generation of its at this year’s Festival of Speed. The HS is MG’s largest SUV in Europe and has been a big seller in recent years owing to its exceptional value. Expect a more premium design inside and out, with the plug-in hybrid model said to offer an ‘unmatched electric range for the class’. Mini has already signalled that a range of EVs over the coming years will wear the firm’s legendary John Cooper Works (JCW) badge and it will show off a new prototype at the Goodwood Festival of Speed based on its new . Performance and powertrain details for the prototype will remain under wraps until it makes a full debut later in the year, however. The Polestar 6 concept . Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath has this to say on that subject: ‘This car is a demonstration of how far we can push our performance brand – Polestar turned up to 11 if you will – and a demonstration of how we could apply the BST formula to our line-up in the future.’ At a dinner on the eve of Goodwood 2024 he further explained that Polestar was already recognised for its typically ‘cool and sophisticated’ Scandinavian design. With the Concept BST ‘we wanted to show that Swedes can actually be quite loud!’ Perhaps the most anticipated reveal at Goodwood this year is . It’s been a long time coming and is the brainchild of Formula 1 designer Adrian Newey. Despite the firm confirming that Newey would take a step back from F1 design duties and leave the company entirely in 2025, final development of the RB17 is currently his primary focus. It’s aimed specifically for track use with its F1-derived mild-hybrid V10 engine. Just 50 will be built at a rate of 15 per year, and at a rumoured cost of £5 million each. It will be an important moment seeing the RB17 for the first time. The is the current holder of the production car record on the Goodwood Festival of Speed hillclimb, with the Time Attack version scorching from start to finish in to 49.32 seconds in 2023. In 2024, the world’s most impressive EV operation is back celebrating 15 years since Mate Rimac started messing around with electric motors, and has brought along its own birthday present. Though it will apparently be taking to the hill, it seems unlikely the Rimac Nevera 15th Anniversary Edition will be aiming to beat that record time, as the example on show is the first of just nine customer cars the firm is planning to build, and they cost in the region of £2m apiece. Each comes fully loaded with ‘all options’ – including the matching luggage – and plenty of copper detailing. There are no changes to the drivetrain, but that’s probably okay when you’ve already got 1888bhp. Chinese brand BYD’s upmarket arm Yangwang (yes, that really is its name) will also be showing its face at Goodwood with its wild 1282bhp U9 electric hypercar, which makes its debut in the UK. BYD will also show off its new crossover while the Denza U9, a premium MPV from the BYD bubble, will also be on show for the first time in the UK. You’ll likely spot its grille before anything else… Making its European debut at the 2024 Festival of Speed is the – or what this wild Danish supercar maker did next, after rocking the world with the wing-tilting . The new model comes in two variants, Agil and Tur, and uses a quad-turbo V12 with up to three electric motors to deliver as much as 1850bhp. You can see the new cars, and a TSR-GT (which will be climbing the hill) on Zenvo dedicated stand, the first it’s ever had at Goodwood. The Festival of Speed takes place at the Goodwood estate close to Chichester in West Sussex. It takes place between Thursday 11 July and Sunday 14 July 2024. Tickets often sell quickly for the Festival of Speed, and this year is no different. At the time of writing, the only date with general admission available was Thursday (at £70 each), with the only way of getting into the remaining dates being as part of a hospitality package. You can buy resale tickets through Twickets, which has partnered with Goodwood as its official ticket resale platform. Unlike other similar sites, there is a cap on what tickets can be resold for, meaning they won’t end up costing significantly more than their original price.

486,Mercedes AMG GT 63 Pro gets more power and increased track focus,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/amg-gt/,Jake Groves,2024-07-11,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-AMG has revealed a new ‘Pro’ version of its AMG GT 63 coupe, bringing a power boost and track-aimed changes. Revealed at Mercedes-Benz World in Weybridge, Surrey, to coincide with the Goodwood Festival of Speed,  it joins existing V8 GT versions and a recently-revealed new plug-in hybrid model. The Pro is intended to be the most track-focused version in the line-up and gets a power boost and styling revisions to give it a racier focus. Mercedes says the changes have been made to improve ‘cornering performance’, while the 805bhp exists for those wanting the best ‘autobahn performance’, the firm says. Its 4.0-litre biturbo V8 engine gets a 27bhp and 37lb ft boost compared to the standard AMG GT 63, now putting out 604bhp and 627lb ft of torque. The 3.0-second 0-62mph time remains the same as the standard version, but extra torque aids improved performance as the speed climbs – 0-124mph is half a second quicker at 10.9 seconds – and the top speed stands at 197mph. A fixed rear spoiler is also now included while a new front bumper improves cooling and aerodynamics, with Mercedes saying it’s taken lessons from the AMG One. Other changes include two new radiators in the front wings and a revised underbody that channels air flow better and improve downforce at the rear. The forged 21-inch alloy wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tyres as standard in the UK, along with a standard carbon-fibre package. Prices are yet to be announced, but it’s likely to come in at around £200,000 when sales begin later in the year. The new Mercedes-AMG GT coupe has gone on sale in the UK in V8 form already. But the two-door coupe’s range has been expanded to include a flagship plug-in hybrid as well as a GT 43 four-cylinder rear-wheel drive model. The first batch of V6 GT 63 Premium Plus, Performance and Launch Edition models start at £164,765 in the UK. That’s a lot of money for Merc’s 911 rival, but the price is inflated because it’s launching in punchy Mercedes-AMG GT 63 4Matic+ spec, meaning it’s the ballistic 577bhp AMG version complete with bi-turbo 4.0-litre V8. The addition of the four-cylinder model and the plug-in hybrid will definitely expand the options available for those looking at AMG’s flagship coupe. We’re sure – mainly because this new GT shares its footprint and wheelbase with the SL convertible. Key design highlights include what the design team call ‘power domes’ over the bonnet, new headlights with triple-dash day-running lights (DRLs) and 3D-shaped rear light clusters. As standard, the AMG GT has an active rear wing, while an aero package on the options list features the fixed wing pictured above. Inside, it’s almost entirely like its SL roadster sibling. Mercedes-Benz’s ‘hyper analogue’ display comprises a deeply inset driver’s instrument panel and a central touchscreen that rises up from the dashboard. Unlike the SL’s version, though, it doesn’t adjust back and forward depending on sunlight. Given it’s a coupe with less chance of catching the rays in bright sunshine, this shouldn’t present a problem. The biggest change, though, is the fact the AMG GT is now a 2+2. Given it runs on the SL platform (to save development budget), some of the SL’s traits have come along for the ride. But, given the low roofline, the rear seats are only for those measuring up to 1.5 metres tall, according to Mercedes-Benz. They can also fold down, boosting boot space – which, itself, is larger than before. CAR has sat in the rear seats and can vouch that they are pretty diddy rear pews for occasional use or children. Handy for bags though. As of April 2024, there are four-cylinder, V8 and plug-in hybrid models of the AMG GT. The range starts with the new AMG GT 43: a rear-driven GT model using the same 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine from the A45, which develops 416bhp. Mercedes-AMG claims a 4.6sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 174mph. Then, there are the V8 options: GT 55 and GT 63, which both feature 4Matic all-wheel drive. The GT 55 delivers 469bhp and 516lb ft, sprinting to 62mph in 3.9 seconds and onto a top speed of 183mph. The GT 63 develops 577bhp and 590lb ft, good for a 3.2sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 195mph. On top of that, technology like AMG’s Ride Control adaptive suspension with active roll control is included, as is a rear differential and rear-wheel steering. Carbon ceramic brakes are optional. Ahead of the 2024 China Auto show, Mercedes-AMG has also revealed its plug-in version of the SL. It has a rather long name: the GT 63 S E-Performance, but comes with a nuclear-powered 805bhp electrified powertrain – the same as the top-spec SL convertible, conveniently – that allows it to sprint to 62mph in 2.8sec. That means the GT 63 S E-Performance is the fastest-accelerating series production AMG ever. For the UK market, we currently only get the V8-powered GT 63. Prices start at a punchy £164,765 for a Premium Plus, rising to £175,765 for a Performance model. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

487,Forget the Bugatti Tourbillon – this long-lost Audi Schnellsportwagen is the V16 we really want to drive,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/auto-union-type-52-schnellsportwagen/,CJ Hubbard,2024-07-15,Car Magazine UK,"Given that Audi Tradition unveiled this Auto Union Type 52 Schnellsportwagen at the last Thursday, you might accuse us of being a little late to the story on the following Monday. But since Audi itself has taken over 90 years to build this thing – or rather, have it built – we figured a few extra days probably wasn’t going to hurt. Besides, it’s such a bonkers project that it deserves its own space in the electronic sun, slightly removed from the furore surrounding the festival. What you’re looking at here is a brand new example – probably, in fact, the example – of a car originally conceived back in 1933. But that’s not the mad bit. The insanity here is that the Type 52 was designed to be a street-legal, road-going version of the 16-cylinder Auto Union Grand Prix cars that and won stacks of trophies during those heady inter-War heydays. What’s more, the Schnellsportwagen moniker used by the original concept papers and the Avant-ish body-shape (ok, we’re getting carried away) makes it perhaps the great-great-grandfather of every subsequent fast Audi estate; as with the seminal , Porsche was involved, too. And to make matters even more interesting, this modern recreation is even wilder than the original concept. Exactly! This is literally the most Goodwood bit of kit we’ve ever seen. It’s seemingly an untold piece of – the Silver Arrows being the collective name for the Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz racing cars that drove motorsport development forward in the pre-WW2 period. According to Audi Tradition, plans for a street-legal Auto Union Grand Prix car were instigated at the end of 1933, just months after the initial Auto Union Type A racing car was first proposed to tackle the incoming 750kg formula that would underpin the 1934-1936 Grand Prix seasons. Working with the Ferdinand Porsche design office – also responsible for the Type A, which is known as the Type 22 by Porsche – Auto Union started to put ‘more concrete’ plans to build the Schnellsportwagen together in 1934. But then abandoned the whole idea in 1935, at which point the concept disappeared into the respective company archives. Had it come to fruition at the time, the Type 52 was intended to be a customer car that would allow well-heeled adventurers to participate in long-distance road races such as the Mille Miglia or endurance competitions such as Le Mans. A factory racing effort was also apparently discussed. What’s particularly bold about it is that it maintains the pioneering mid-engine layout of the Auto Union Grand Prix cars. More than half the length of this working recreation is taken up by the engine compartment. If it had been built at the time, it would surely have been in with a shout of being heralded as the first ever supercar. The contemporary design specs make fascinating reading. While it was intended to use a bespoke ladder-frame chassis, the Type 52 was designed around the racing V16 drivetrain from the Auto Union Type 22. Although because the engineers weren’t totally insane (something Audi Tradition has clearly set out to rectify, as you’ll see below), a few choice modifications were to be made to this as well. For starters, the Roots supercharger was to be re-geared to reduce boost, and the 4.4-litre (4358cc) engine’s compression ratio modified so it could run on regular petrol (instead of the wild petrol-alcohol mixes deployed in competition). This would have given the street-legal version around 197bhp at 3650rpm – not to mention 321lb ft at 2350rpm, which would have been pretty attention grabbing in 1934 when delivered via those skinny rear wheels. And while that is a reduction from the reputed 295bhp and 391lb ft of the racing version, the engineers reckoned the Schnellsportwagen would still be good for ‘around 200km/h’ flat out. That’s 124mph. A test car was proposed, but as far as Audi Tradition can make out, none was ever built. That means this modern recreation is likely the only Type 52 ever completed. Similar in spirit, certainly, but numerous adjustments have been made along the way – many of which Audi believes would have been inevitable during the development process should an original have made it beyond paper. The build was handed to British experts . This highly specialised restoration firm has an extensive history of completing similar projects for other brands, as well as being responsible for curating Audi’s own Silver Arrows collection. Making it ideal to undertake producing the Schnellsportwagen from scratch. This was done ‘in constant and intensive communication’ with Audi Tradition, especially when it came to resolving what’s described as ‘a range of technicalities’. After all, there were very few period records to refer to. Auto Union came under the Russian occupied zone at the end of the Second World War, which resulted in almost all of the historic racing cars, files and photographs disappearing. As such there are no ‘verified’ contemporary reports about the intended ‘final configuration’ of the Type 52, if there ever even was one. Some carefully considered decisions therefore had to made between Audi and Crosthwaite & Gardiner. For instance, the road-going suspension design, which differs from that of the racing cars, as well as the position of all the other major components meant the wheelbase had to be lengthened compared with the original design. Audi also consciously chose to fit the powertrain from the later Auto Union Type C racing cars of 1936 instead of the intended Type A unit from 1934. This was done, it seems, for ease of future management – the parts are compatible with the Type C models already in the Audi collection. For the same reason, the engine fitted in the Type 52 here is no longer a detuned road-friendly item, but instead full Grand Prix spec, including the requirement of special methanol fuel! That exclamation point is no joke. With the full 6.0-litre (6005cc) Auto Union Type C Grand Prix engine, the Schnellsportwagen pictured here has a completely ludicrous 512bhp. Audi declines to speculate on what the resulting top speed would be, but we hope that someone has a go at it at some point… That fuel mix is 50 per cent methanol, 40 per cent super-unleaded and 10 per cent toluene. The car is 5390mm long, 1780mm wide and 1660mm tall. It weighs 1450kg – an increase over the original’s proposed 1300kg – and will accommodate three people, with a central seating position for the driver and a passenger on each side. There are two spare wheels in the back, some room for luggage and lovely trimming in the cabin. But not very much in way of creature comforts; we sincerely doubt that sealed bulkhead does much to reduce the noise from the engine compartment at speed. There was no record of the intended colour, but given all of the above it seems highly appropriate the Type 52 Schnellsportwagen recreation has been painted the same Cellulose Silver as the racing cars.

488,Red Bull’s RB17 is ‘Adrian Newey off the lead’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_red-bull/rb17/,Jake Groves,2024-07-15,Car Magazine UK,"Red Bull’s track-ready hypercar, the RB17, is ‘Adrian [Newey] off the lead’ says Red Bull Racing team principal, Christian Horner. The super streamlined hypercar was unveiled at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed in a reveal event that marked 20 years of Red Bull Racing. RB17 has been created from the ground up by engineering mastermind Adrian Newey as well as Red Bull Advanced Technologies, with the hypercar promising ‘F1-equivalent lap times.’ ‘I had been mulling around the idea to take on the challenge to design our very own hypercar from concept to delivery,’ says Newey. ‘It has been a magnificent project and journey.’ Oh absolutely. Right at the heart of the RB17 is a 4.5-litre naturally aspirated V10 that redlines to 15,000rpm as well as an electric motor. Total system output of 1183bhp, with all of that power being sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed transmission made out of carbonfibre and a hydraulically-locking active differential. Red Bull says the RB17 is capable of speeds beyond 217mph. Different drive modes are available to help get the best out of the car, and Red Bull also says the RB17 is designed to be durable to do a 24-hour endurance race without any servicing required. Indeed it does. Given Newey worked on the Aston Martin Valkyrie, you can see similarities in the silhouette and the wild aerodynamics. Red Bull says the RB17 has active aerodynamic elements within the front and rear wings and diffuser allowing for the best aero possible for the driving situation. The whole car is made from carbonfibre, features a motorsport-spec ‘survival cell’ and is designed to Le Mans Hypercar safety regulations. On top of that, it’s a two-seater – allowing you to scare the life out of someone on track. Or, more sensibly, have someone with you training you. Full carbonfibre 18-inch wheels with full slick Michelin tyres are included, with a 20-inch option using a treaded tyre option. Pushrod suspension features here, with active ride height control and adjustable dampers, as well as a nose lift mode to get over speed bumps. The steering, interestingly, is hydraulically-assisted (not electric, like most modern cars) and carbon carbon (yes, they exist, and are used exclusively in motorsport – including on the Ferrari 499P) brakes are included. ‘Everything is in-house,’ says Newey. ‘We’re using the same suppliers as we did in Formula One, so it’s the same build process we’d do if we were building an F1 car. That’s the reason we’re limited to 50 cars – [if RBAT made more] then we wouldn’t be able to manufacture it in the same way.’ Red Bull is more than happy to point out that it has the means, money and engineering capacity to do it, with Horner throwing shade at Aston Martin’s Valkyrie (which Newey had a significant part in developing in). ‘It nearly sunk Aston Martin, even if it did add a lot to their share price,’ says Horner. ‘With us, we said that we were going to do this project the proper Formula One way and do it properly with all the applications on how do we build it – but then it’s going to come with a price tag comparative with that technology.’ Well you’ll need to be very wealthy first, with prices for each of the 50 RB17s being made pushing north of £5m a pop, and that’s before an expected £1m+ when it comes to customising it. ‘There are no FIA constraints and therefore no cost cap,’ says Horner, ‘so that’s the reason why it’s so f***ing expensive!’ While a the reveal event of the RB17, we spotted celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay rubbing shoulders with Red Bull’s elite. For that hefty price tag, though, you get wined and dined by Red Bull from the moment of order to a point way past delivery. Red Bull says it’ll bring you to races, as well as ‘a range of activities and events’ to welcome [you] to the Red Bull family.’ That includes events surrounding Red Bull Racing’s upcoming 20-year anniversary, F1 race and test entry and, of course, time in a simulator to prep you for your RB17 arriving. That’s on top of the entire step-by-step process of designing your RB17. And then, when you have it, Red Bull says it will host track driving events and training for you to get the most out of owning one.

489,Reinventing the wheel: how Audi’s new MHEV Plus system works,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/audi-mhev-plus/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-07-16,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has made a rather bold business decision. The brand has shifted its focus away from and launched a new, combustion-only vehicle architecture that’s designed to underpin everything from the new A5 to the future . Audi has dubbed its new chassis ‘Premium Platform Combustion’ (or PPC for short). And if you’re a keen chassis code twitcher, you’ve probably already realised that it was designed to be the dinosaur-burning equivalent to the company’s new Premium Platform Electric (PPE) underpinnings. PPC was developed for use by Audi. We have it on good authority from the project’s lead engineers that the same underpinnings can’t be used to prop up cars like the or . That’s because its engines are mounted longitudinally rather than transversely, which won’t work with those cars’ packaging limitations. To complement PPC, Audi has designed a fresh range of fossil fuel engines that are teamed with a brand-spanking new 48-volt system called MHEV Plus. The technology will be available on all Audi’s future combustion cars – and, because it’s rather complicated, we thought it’d be best to explain how it works in a separate page. As the name suggests, MHEV Plus is a more sophisticated reimagining of mild hybrid technology. It uses two electric motors and a beefy 1.76kWh battery pack to both improve the efficiency of Audi’s engines and increase their performance. Those two electric motors aren’t exactly where you’d expect them to be, though. There’s a belt-driven starter generator bolted to the engine and a ‘drivetrain generator’ mounted on the back of the gearbox. This second unit is the important one. It’s an electric motor about the size of a loaf of bread – and Audi went through the trouble of designing it because it’s more efficient at harvesting power when the car is decelerating. Instead of only relying on the rotational mass of the engine (like a belt-driven starter-generator), Audi’s drivetrain generator can capitalise on the mass of the entire car and the additional torque from the rotating wheels to generate more electricity, faster. This is important, because the battery pack for MHEV Plus is a lot larger than your average mild hybrid car’s. For context, the MHEV uses a 0.38kWh battery for its 48-volt mild hybrid powertrain. Audi’s MHEV Plus battery is more than 4.5 times larger than that, which allows the powertrain to acts more like a in use. Primarily, it’ll allow Audi to extend the life of its combustion engines well into the 2030s. The brand’s customers have made it quite clear that they’re not all ready to make the switch to an electric car just yet – and Kerstin Englhardt, project leader for the PPC architecture, told us she was ‘convinced’ petrol and diesel engines will play a part in Audi’s future, right up until the EU ban. Audi says it has a more intelligent power management system that your average mild hybrid system, too, because the system uses electricity almost as quickly as it generates it. The result is better fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions. In fact, Audi claims MHEV Plus trims 10g/km on its newly developed 2.0-litre diesel engine and 17g/km on its fresh 3.0-litre V6 engine for its S-badged cars. That’s significant. The electric motor on the back of the gearbox can also power the all on its own at speeds of up to 18mph. That means you can creep through urban traffic or park up entirely on electric power. Once you’re up to speed, MHEV Plus can keep Audi’s new generation of combustion cars ticking along at speed of up to 87mph, helping to reduce fuel consumption on the motorway. And if you need to zap past a dawdling wagon, the tech chucks an extra 24bhp at whatever powertrain its bolted to when you mat the gas. Final fuel economy figures are yet to be confirmed, but Audi tells us the tech saves 0.38 litres of fuel per 100km on its new diesel and 0.74 litres of fuel per 100km on its new V6.

490,Never say die: Audi hedges its bets on electric vehicles,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/plans-to-retain-petrol-and-diesel-cars-until-at-least-2033/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-07-16,Car Magazine UK,"Audi’s launched its and – shock horror – it’s powered by a range of petrol and diesel engines rather than batteries and electric motors. This is a bold move from a company which, just two short years ago, announced its plans to . Audi also said it wouldn’t launch another dinosaur-burning model from 2026. But now, the company is poised to launch a range of brand-spanking new petrol and diesel cars, all of which it’ll be able to keep around until the . To reflect this shift in strategy, Audi has restructured its model range into two ‘columns.’ Now, Audi’s odd-numbered cars (such as the A5, Q5 and Q7) will feature combustion engines, while its even-numbered models (that’s the A4, A6 and Q6) will be propelled by batteries and electric motors. I attended the preview event for the new Audi A5 and, to try and unearth why the brand has made such a dramatic U-turn, I seized the chance to quiz some of the company’s engineers. Scroll down to read through my findings. Not all Audi’s customers are ready to make the switch to an electric vehicle. In fact, electric car sales are already – and uptake in the leasing market is slow. Providers are amassing huge stockpiles of unwanted electric cars, which they’re having to flog at knockdown prices to clear space for fresher metal. So, Audi has, rather pre-emptively, divvied up its eggs between two baskets. It’s adopted a two-platform strategy – one for each column. The brand’s zero-emission models will be built on its Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture, as found under the new , while its future fossil fuel cars will be propped up by its new Premium Platform Combustion architecture. This latter chassis was designed specifically for use by Audi, and it’ll be complemented by a range of freshly developed petrol, diesel and hybrid powertrains – the former two of which are supported some snazzy new . The brand also says it can extend or truncate the lifespans of either platform to adapt to changes in legislation and react to the needs of different markets. Kerstin Englhardt, project leader for Audi’s PPC architecture, told me: ‘We still have combustion engines because we are convinced that we also need them for the future, for some markets. At the moment, our plan is to end it by 2033. ‘But, if we see in 2030, there’s new regulations in the European Parliament that [postpones] when we need to get out completely from the combustion engines and go over to the electric engines, we’re also thinking about running our combustion platform [for] longer.’ By the sound of it, a very long time yet. In fact, Detlef Harzer, technical project manager for the new A5, reckons his new car has the potential to stick around right up until the 2035 deadline. I quizzed him about how the A5 would evolve between now and the combustion engine ban. He told me: ‘We are prepared to give [combustion engines] a longer life. ‘We are prepared for both columns. We will also see some law-driven development because there will be regions that can’t switch so fast – and we want to be prepared for both sides. It will be such a sliding process. But if it’s the combustion car in the A5 model range, I couldn’t say.’ At that point, my ears pricked up. Harzer noticed my enthusiasm and followed up his statement by saying: ‘I think it will run longer than it’s planned.’ I immediately quizzed him about how the next, next generation version of the Audi A5 would look. Much like Volkswagen’s plans for extending the life of its , Harzer told me Audi hopes to keep the A5 alive by launching a heavily updated version of the car that’ll break cover next week. In essence, that means the new A5 will end up having two facelifts – one four years into its production cycle and one eight years in. That makes better financial sense for Audi than shovelling a truckload of cash at an all-new car that will, at best (providing the EU doesn’t do a handbrake turn on its eco-friendly motoring policies), only be on sale four years before legislation kills it. Audi’s still being rather coy about that, but it sounds like it’ll underpin all the combustion-powered cars from the A5 up. I asked Englhardt what the largest vehicle class is that’s being earmarked for PPC, to which she said: ‘I’m not sure if we can talk about that already but, yeah, up to our biggest cars.’ Allow me to translate. That’s evasive PR speak for ‘we’re building the next Q7 on it.’ Max Röhnlein, Audi’s technical project leader for engines, also explained how the PPC architecture has a lot of headroom in it. ‘The focus for Audi on that platform is also our lifecycle – to get more features in, to get more engines, or something like that. To be able to put in more functions for the customer.’ Röhnlein also hinted that Audi Sport isn’t giving up on combustion power, either, with both he and Englhardt confirming there’s a lot more performance to extract from PPC.

492,"Porsche Macan EV gains cheaper, longer-range RWD model",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/macan-ev/,Ben Barry,2024-07-16,Car Magazine UK,"Porsche has expanded the line-up of its new electric Macan with a rear-wheel-drive version that lowers the price and increases the range. Joining the existing Macan 4 and Turbo is the entry-level, efficiency-focused ‘Macan’ as well as a 4S model that is positioned as a sportier version. The new rear-wheel-drive model lowers the Macan EV’s starting price by around £2,500 to £67,200, while the range increases to an impressive 398 miles. It still uses the 100kWh battery that’s shared with all Macan models, but gets a single rear-mounted 335bhp electric motor. This can increase to 355bhp with launch control activated, and allows for 0-62mph time of 5.7 seconds. The single-motor also reduces the weight by 110kg compared to the Macan 4. Likely to be one of the most popular versions of the Macan is the newly introduced 4S model, which slots beneath the Turbo in the line-up. The twin-motor setup produces 442bhp, but 509bhp is available in short bursts courtesy of the launch control overboots function. This reduces the 0-62mph time to 4.1 seconds, while still promising a claimed 376 miles from a charge. Prices for the Macan 4S start from £75,400. Despite the first new Macan EVs not even being delivered in the UK yet, Porsche has already set about updating its electric SUV. A new Slate Grey Neo colour is available, along with a fresh set of 20-inch wheels. Porsche is also offering a new ‘off-road design package’, which gets a redesigned bumper and a tweaked adaptive air suspension setup that gives the Macan EV a better approach angle and increases the ground clearance. We’re not quite sure who’s buying an Electric Porsche Macan to go off-roading, mind. Porsche has also tweaked the Macan’s screens with new animations and greater ambient lighting features. Read on to find out more about the new 2024 Porsche Macan electric. A family resemblance eases the abrupt transition from an incumbent that doesn’t even offer mild hybridisation to a full EV future, but only inconsequential clips and fixings are shared between the two. Despite the family look, dimensions are quite different between generations. Most significant is a total length stretched some 100mm to 4784mm, with the wheelbase some 86mm longer, but the new car is also 15mm wider and just 2mm lower. Fitted with the 22-inch alloys (20s are the minimum) Porsche has spec’d on the cars we’re poking around in a Stuttgart studio, it’s a longer, sleeker, more muscular look than before. Frameless door glass, a more pronounced coupe profile and various active-aero devices (rear spoiler, front cooling flaps, flexible covers on a fully sealed underbody) all help drop the coefficient of drag to an elbows-in, head-below-handlebars 0.25Cd. Naturally a larger body and more space-efficient EV powertrain affords more interior space than before – six-feet tall passengers have just enough kneeroom to perch behind a similarly tall driver, as well as surprisingly generous headroom given the aggressively raked roofline. Luggage storage also increases, from today’s 497 to 540 litres in the case of the Macan 4 with the rear seats in their most upright position – the Turbo offers a little less due to its Bose subwoofer that goes all the way up to anti-social. In both cases there’s a further 84 litres of storage in the ‘froot.’ Given the 570kg battery under the floor, it’s surprising to learn occupants can sit some 28mm lower in the front, and 15mm lower in the rear than the previous Macan – gains reaped from attention-to-detail on the seat bases. Like the exterior design, the ‘Porsche Driver Experience’ cockpit is similarly familiar. Clearly inspired by the Taycan’s layout and operating logic, PDE debuted last year in the facelifted Cayenne with a new Android Operating System. A 12.6-inch curved instrument binnacle is shared between the two SUVs, and can switch from a digital representation of Porsche’s classic analogue dials to more modern layouts, while the touchscreen central display is proportionally smaller at 10.9 inches. An additional 10.9-inch screen is optional for front-seat passengers. Thankfully climate-control functions are still controlled via a physical interface that’s easy to feel out on the move, and route planning contains easily accessed info on the charging points you’ll encounter along the way, including charging speeds, occupancy and payment methods – a decade of connected services keeps you up-to-date too. The new Macan moves away from the clean-sheet J1 architecture developed for Taycan and – unlike and the – leaves no provision for internal-combustion derivatives spun from the same building blocks. Instead, a new PPE (Premium Platform Electric) platform co-developed with Audi lays foundations for the Macan, and Porsche’s plan that more than 80 per cent of sales will be zero emissions by 2030. Some markets, not including the UK , will continue parallel sales of the existing Macan, probably for two or three more years. Two Macan variants launched initially, both with one permanently excited synchronous e-motor per axle (the rear beefier and able to provide either most – the 4 – or all – the Turbo – of total system power in extreme situations). There is also a single-speed transmission rather than the Taycan’s two speeder. Neither variant lacks go. The 4 is good for 402bhp (only a little below the current range-topping Macan GTS), with a 0-62mph time of 5.2 seconds and 138mph flat out. The Turbo, meanwhile, benefits from 630bhp, a 3.3 0-62mph time and 163mph top speed. That leaves plenty of room for other derivatives in between, plus insiders draw our attention to the presence of a ‘4’ on the entry-level badge, leaving us to imagine a rear-drive 2 with a little extra range positioned below it. In all cases, a 100kWh lithium-ion battery (of which 95kWh is useable) nestles between the axles, with 12 individually replaceable modules providing a maximum 383-mile range in the 4 – better than not only the max figures for the rather disappointing Taycan (316 miles) but also the (331 miles) and BMW’s (285 miles) and (up to 349 miles). Battery construction and power electronics are comparable to the Taycan, including an 800-volt architecture that opens the door to smaller cables for less weight, better packaging space and shorter charge times. With all your charging stars aligned, the Macan can charge at up to 270kW, enough for a 10-80 per cent battery boost in 21 minutes. Rather than the Taycan’s more costly and bulkier charging booster, however, the Macan deploys ‘bank charging’, so when a charging station uses 400-volt technology, bank charging effectively tricks the station into thinking it’s charging two 400-volt batteries simultaneously. Charging is faster as a result, with 135kW your max. Porsche is also keen to point out the battery contributes to a centre of gravity some 140mm lower, if less keen to note a kerbweight that increases by around 300kg compared with its predecessor at 2100-2200kg. But our test drive of an early prototype tells us brilliance lurks here. It starts with new double-wishbone front suspension and a multi-link rear, with coil springs for the base model rising to full air suspension and two-valve shocks being optional for the 4 and standard for the range-topper. The Turbo also gets an electronically controlled rear differential (aka Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus) and rear-wheel steering that can turn by up to 5 degrees. Like the Taycan, all-wheel drive is also fully variable but the new electrical architecture makes response times even faster, responding to slip in just 10ms.

493,The road to Le Mans: Racing-spec Aston Martin Valkyrie spotted testing at Silverstone,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/aston-martin/le-mans-wec-imsa/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-07-17,Car Magazine UK,"Aston Martin is well on its way to Le Mans. A new video has surfaced of an LMH-spec version of Gaydon’s hypercar testing at Silverstone, and it looks and sounds as extreme as you’d expect. The and image you see below were posted to Twitter soon after the test and show what looks to be a racier version of the V12-powered Valkyrie disguised in camouflage. As you’d expect, it’s grown further downforce-generating bodywork but still keeps the same streamlined, prototype silhouette as before. Aston really wanted to one up Ferrari by having not 3 but 5 fins on its rear wing The appearance of Aston Martin comes days after the unveil of the RB17, Adrian Newey’s most recent hypercar design. Red Bull hasn’t announced any plans to race its hypercar though, so this is the only one you’ll see at Le Mans in the near future. Could have been Darren Turner testing the Aston Martin Valkyrie LMH spec today at Silverstone? 🤔 Aston Martin is returning to Le Mans in 2025, and it’s using the Valkyrie hypercar to do it. When it hits the track, it’ll be the first hypercar with a road car counterpart to compete within the current rules. It’ll be running two of them as well. ‘We have been present at Le Mans since the earliest days, and through those glorious endeavours we succeeded in winning Le Mans in 1959 and our class 19 times over the past 95 years,’ said Lawrence Stroll, Executive Chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda at an event to announce the news. ‘Now we return to the scene of those first triumphs aiming to write new history with a racing prototype inspired by the fastest production car Aston Martin has ever built.’ ‘In addition to our presence in the FIA F1 World Championship, Aston Martin’s return to the pinnacle of endurance racing will allow us to build a deeper connection with our customers and community, many of whom found their passion for the brand through our past success at Le Mans. And of course, the complex knowledge-base we are building through our F1® team is data that Aston Martin Performance Technologies can harness to further enhance the capabilities of the Valkyrie racecar at Le Mans, in WEC and IMSA.’ If this sounds familiar it’s because Aston Martin was originally tipped to join the WEC championship in 2020-2021, before financial issues forced the company to withdraw. Now, though, with solid financial support Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin will compete in both the WEC championship as well as the IMSA championship. This means that the prototype Valkyrie will race in Le Mans, the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. Like many other hypercar programs, Aston Martin’s Valkyrie entry will be a joint project between the Gaydon company and its racing partner Heart of Racing (HoR). The Valkyrie AMR Pro was originally designed to meet the new LMH hypercar regulations, and now Aston Martin Performance Technologies has begun to turn that product into something that fits within the aero and power performance window allowed by the rules. Homologation will occur before it’s able to compete in the WEC and IMSA series in 2025. In Pro form, the car exceeds the Balance of Performance envelope, so the development time will be spent with Aston’s engineers pairing back the AMR Pro’s capabilities: ‘It is actually quite a task to detune to every performance and into the legislative performance.’ said Adam Carter, head of endurance motorsport at Aston Martin. ‘And that’s also great opportunity in terms of still you come down to the downfalls but how many sensitivities and so as all those opportunities come there. And so rather than just turning the dial, it’s about if we turn this dial down what else can we turn up elsewhere to get the most performance.’ Aero performance will be challenging to reduce, particularly as the road car is almost exclusively designed for aerodynamic efficiency – like the RB17, it’s an Adrian Newey-penned car after all. The racing Valkyrie will use a carbonfibre chassis like the road car, and gets to keep its high-revving, Cosworth-built 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 – but here it’ll be detuned to withstand the rigours of sustained racing and fit into the correct BoP envelope. To that end, Cosworth is an integral partner in the project. Despite Le Mans’ most recent rule set push hybrid technology in some form, the track-going Valkyrie we’ll see in 2025 won’t have a battery-electric hybrid system like the road car. Aston Martin also announced a GT3 program at the same time, setting it up to be the only manufacturer to compete in every level of endurance racing available in 2025. As we heard back at the 2023 Silverstone GP, Aston Martin is setting itself up to be the British version of Ferrari, and it’s using motorsport to do it. From endurance racing to F1, Gaydon and Silverstone are set to become even more of a motorsport force in the next few years. What’s more, WEC also appears the place to be – just as F1 was just before the onset of its Drive To Survive-powered surge in popularity: ‘As a sport as a business is on fire,’ said Stroll. ‘Formula One teams have appreciated in value significantly over the last few years due to the popularity of the sport due to cost caps.’ With an influx of factory teams, it’s very possible endurance racing will soon enjoy a similar spotlight – and just as with Formula One – Aston Martin will be primed to rake in the increased awareness and profits.

494,Czinger 21C: meet the founders of ‘most badass’ supercar maker that toppled Goodwood record,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/czinger/21c/,Jake Groves,2024-07-17,Car Magazine UK,"There’s a new, fastest production car record holder at the and it’s this: the Czinger 21C. A Rattlesnake Green example of this wild hypercar, driven by veteran racing driver Chris Ward, clocked a 48.82sec run up the hill during the Timed Shootout on the Sunday of the 2024 event (pictured below), toppling the 49.32sec record held by the set in 2023. Before the Czinger 21C – pronounced like ‘zinger’ with a soft ‘s’ just before it – took its timed runs up the hill on the final day of the FoS event, we grabbed some time with one half of the father/son founding duo, and CEO, of this all-American hypercar creator, Kevin Czinger. ‘Well, I started a technology company called Divergent Technologies,’ Kevin Czinger, CEO and founder of Czinger (pictured below) tells us, ‘and Divergent has Czinger as a product company under it. My son [Lukas, co-founder and chief operating officer] joined me shortly after and we’re equal partners.’ ‘My two older brothers were car mechanics and racecar builders, and you can have really cool tools doing that sort of thing. But it’s not that cool unless you’re doing your own thing. This is us doing our own thing: there’s no real badass American sports car brand, so we’re going to always take those tools and be a step ahead of everybody else that we do things for, and just create the most badass vehicies,’ adds Kevin. Czinger has recruited engineers, technicians and high-ranking executives from places like Mercedes AMG’s F1 team, Honda, Red Bull Racing and more. And the Czinger 21C certainly looks badass, with performance figures to back it up. The 21C uses a bespoke, mid-mounted 2.88-litre flat-crank V8 with twin turbos and 800V of hybrid assistance. Peak power is a staggering 1250bhp with a 11,000rpm redline, and weighing just 1250kg, 0-62mph takes just 1.88 seconds. Czinger also says the hybrid system consists of an e-motor on each front wheel, while regeneration is carried out through braking as well. The 21C’s V8 will also accept a range of fuels – including synthetic e-fuels. Three versions have been created depending on your requirement: the standard 1250bhp 21C is designed for handling over top speed; the 21C Vmax is the sleek aerodynamic model that’ll clock 253mph, and the 21C Blackbird that’s designed for track use and deploys that max 1350bhp. ‘Unlike most of the supercars you see [at Goodwood], we did this all in three years. A car that can do a quarter mile in 8.1 seconds, but it’s a completely street-legal with zero crash exemptions or emissions exemptions. It can be sold off the dealer lot, and yet it can blow the doors off of anything,’ Kevin tells us. Partially why it can be sold in most markets is the fact that it has a central driving position. There are two seats, but the passenger sits directly behind the driver for ultimate aerodynamic efficiency. But Czinger’s real secret sauce comes from harnessing Divergent’s massive amount of available computing power and leveraging more than 700 patents. ‘I have 219 of those,’ says Kevin, ‘and Lukas has 80. We’re both engineers, partners and different generations… and he’s my boss!’ On top of that, the 21C’s chassis is 3D printed for the most tensile strength using the least amount of materials. Yes, it’s what separates Czinger from the ruling classes of the hypercar hierarchy – and is something the brand calls its ‘Bio-Logic’ technology. There’s a central carbonfibre tub for the passenger cell, which is then added to with a 3D-printed alloy. What results is something that looks alien, and almost organic – and yet the structure was crafted and designed entirely by machines. ‘We build our own 3D printers, and all of these materials are generated internally using machine learning,’ Kevin tells us. When I point out that it looks organic, rather than computer made, Kevin responds: ‘If you look at your garden as a design space for a set of ecosystem conditions, you’re flowing materials like potassium, nitrogen, CO2, H20 within that system. Then evolution, another system, comes along that optimises the structures of flora and fauna against those constraints and conditions. ‘Just imagine those engineering constraints in a construction system. It’s not like we’re trying to do anything that looks like anything, it’s simply that this is mirroring an evolutionary process. But what takes eons based on trial and error with evolution, we can simulate it in microseconds.’ Yup – a circa £2m hypercar that can topple records. As well as the new Goodwood one, in August 2021, the 21C smashed the lap record at Laguna Seca. Driver Joel Miller set a time of 1:25.44sec in ‘ideal’ conditions at the fabled California track. The 21C took more than two seconds out of the previous benchmark of 1:27.62sec, set by a McLaren Senna in October 2019. Riding on Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2R tyres, Czinger said Miller also managed to break the previous record on two other attempts. ‘Building a new car is not easy and this group built one fast car,’ said Miller in 2021, reflecting on his run. ‘What the powertrain is capable of doing is absolutely mind blowing at maximum power.’ Chief engineer Ewan Baldry agreed, adding that the ‘most exciting part is that we know we have more performance to come.’ The success at Laguna Seca has been repeated, with the 21C annihilating the previous record – this time held by a McLaren P1 – by six seconds.

495,GTS and mighty Turbo S E-Hybrid Porsche Panamera versions launch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/panamera/,Jake Groves,2024-07-18,Car Magazine UK,"The line-up of the latest has expanded with a new GTS model, as well as a flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid version. have accounted for the bulk of sales of this Porsche’s sales in recent years, driven by company car-friendly tax rates, and serving as an alternative to the dominating . So it’s no wonder Porsche is boosting the roster. The GTS trim, meanwhile, is designed as the sweet spot of performance and tech. The Panamera’s range has a huge number of plug-in hybrids in it: 4 E-Hybrid and 4S E-Hybrid, Turbo E-Hybrid and now a flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid. Go for a 4 or 4S and it uses a twin-turbo 2.9-litre V6 engine in an individual state of tune combined with a new, more powerful electric motor. On the 4 E-Hybrid, the combined outputs are 464bhp and 479lb ft of torque, with the 4S’s more powerful ICE helping to generate 537bhp and 553lb ft. Accelerating from 0-62mph takes 4.2 seconds and 3.7 seconds respectively. Porsche has also kitted the new Panamera out with a larger 25.9kWh battery with 45 per cent more capacity than before, with a claimed electric range of up to 59 miles. Choose a Turbo or Turbo S E-Hybrid and you benefit from an electrified 4.0-litre V8. Turbo E-Hybrid generates 671bhp, equating to a dazzling 3.2-second 0-62mph time and 196mph top speed. The new flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid, which launched in July 2024, arrives with a mighty 771bhp and 738lb ft, good for a 2.9sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 202mph. Don’t want a PHEV? The Panamera GTS uses a mild hybrid version of the V8 deployed with those Turbo cars, developing 493bhp and sprinting to 62mph in 3.8sec. It does, and we likely share your sentiment that it looks almost identical to the previous model. Despite that, Porsche’s VP for the Panamera model line, Thomas Friemuth, says it’s ‘a totally new Panamera.’ Emphasising the point, he adds: ‘The new front design is mainly characterised by being more athletic with more sharp lines. The side view you will see we have the option of centre-lock wheels, which is the first time here,’ adds Friemuth. And he’s right – Turbo models now feature centre-lock wheels that ape the brand’s various GT models elsewhere in the range. There are new colours available, too, including this tasty orange pictured. ‘We’re working on our customers!’ Friemuth tells us when we discussed the expansion beyond sober blacks, greys and silvers usually seen with the Panamera; ‘we will try to learn to give our customers the opportunity to show some colour, not always grey.’ Friemuth also says that Porsche wants to do more to separate those who buy the hotter Turbo models. As well as those centre-lock wheels, Panamera Turbo models benefit from a more aggressive bodykit and the return of the triple-panel fold out rear wing. ‘The real big issue is what we call ‘Turbo differentiation’, this is new for Porsche,’ says Friemuth. ‘Our Turbo customers are special customers, and we now offer them differentiation which is not available for all the other customers.’ Part of that is the new ‘Turbonite’ colour scheme; a satin grey hue trimming various bits of the bodywork, as well as the interior. On top of that, Porsche has coloured its crest in Turbonite. The cockpit has subtly evolved, too. The new ‘Porsche Driver Experience’ control layout might look rather familiar on first glance. Porsche’s classic GT steering wheel can be seen in the supplied pictures, and details directly in front of the driver include a curved instrument display and a shifter that’s been cloned from the . A high centre console remains, complete with physical climate controls and volume dial – as well as what look like touch panel controls similar to the last generation. Again, like the Taycan, a passenger display can be seen inset into the dashboard – affording the front passenger more infotainment functionality for themselves. A filter on the passenger screen that blocks the driver from seeing it, as with the latest Cayenne. A head-up display is an option, and the cockpit is filled with ambient lighting. Porsche says that, as well as the gentle evolution of technology inside, the Panamera benefits from upgraded seat foam materials and additional upholster customisation options available when the car launches. A leather-free Race-Tex upholstery will be available for the first time in the Panamera, too. On top of that, Porsche has confirmed the return of the Executive model available in certain markets that features a more spacious second row with newly-contoured seating. Rear passengers also benefit from a small touchscreen that runs along the centre console, too. Fear not, as Porsche continues to sell a Panamera without any of this hybrid business. Of course, Porsche doesn’t do ‘entry-level’ in the same way other carmakers do, with a 348bhp 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol engine being used in both the Panamera and Panamera 4. It’s essentially the 4 E-Hybrid but without the electric motor. There is also the sporty GTS model with a much more potent V8, which Porsche claims is the ‘most agile’ version of the Panamera. As well as a SportDesign bodykit, the GTS is 10mm lower than a regular Panamera and features the brand’s Torque Vectoring Plus technology included as standard. New Panamera models also benefit from two-chamber air suspension with two-valve dampers and a semi-active anti-roll bar (called PDCC Sport in Porsche code). You can also choose another, entirely different suspension system for E-Hybrid models: Active Ride. ‘It’s a game-changer,’ Friemuth tells CAR. The technology uses hydraulics and those two-valve dampers, and allows those models to tilt into corners or maintain an equilibrium when accelerating or braking hard. When you pull on the door handle (when getting in or out), the car’s ride height jumps up by 550mm for easier access. Naturally, it’s about stepping up the Panamera’s handling characteristics and improving the ride quality over the standard setup. So much so that Porsche says the system manages to be more comfortable, more refined and deliver unparalleled athleticism all at the same time. Read our to find out what we think of Active Ride in action. The range starts with the £79,500 Panamera, and it’ll be £3000 more if you want it as a ‘4’. If you want the Panamera as a PHEV, the new 4 E-Hybrid and 4S E-Hybrid start from £90,300 and £102,100. The Turbo E-Hybrid, not surprisingly, commands quite the premium at £141,500. Even wealthier than that? The Turbo S E-Hybrid will set you back from £168,700. After a Panamera Sport Turismo estate? You’re out of luck – this generation doesn’t get an estate model. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

499,Kia's EV3: the space race EV that starts from £33k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kia/ev3/,Jake Groves,2024-07-29,Car Magazine UK,"Kia has officially revealed its new EV3 electric car, promising big space, big range and big brain thinking when it comes to the tech inside. The brand has already impressed with the EV6, and proven it’s not hard to do a three-row electric family car with the EV9 (we’re looking at you, Land Rover), so now Kia has turned its attention to the smaller and more accessible end of the scale. The brand is targeting the likes of the Volvo EX30 and Smart #1 in the cutesy crossover space, but also has its sights set on Volkswagen’s ID.3 and the Cupra Born. Noticed a trend in those rivals? They’re all European, with Kia’s team saying that the EV3 is arguably the most Euro-friendly EV model it’s made so far. It’s also closing in on many of those cars in terms of price. Kia UK has confirmed the EV3’s list price starts at £32,995. It’s certainly an interesting (challenging?) looking thing, and hasn’t changed too much from the EV3 concept we saw in 2023. New design cues from other Kia models like the ‘star map’ DRL signature at the front (which essentially means differing DRL designs that all follow the same sort of trend), and blocky wheel designs similar to those seen on the EV9, appear here. It’s shorter and lower than a Niro, but the wheelbase is exactly the same as the larger Sportage – a move designed to maximise passenger space. Combine that with the boxy silhouette, particularly at the rear end, and you end up with loads of rear legroom (we’ve sat inside and yes, it’s roomy) and a boot area rated to 460 litres – around 100 more litres than most of the EV3’s closest rivals. The boot extends to 1250 with the seats down, and there’s a 25-litre ‘frunk’ big enough for your charging cables. No chrome is used anywhere, with lots of the car’s ‘jewellery’ finished in black, and the EV3 introduces two new colours to Kia’s palette: Aventurine Green and Terracotta. ‘We’re still in this transition phase [between combustion and electric],’ David Hart, Kia’s creative manager for the EV3’s exterior, tells CAR. ‘For us, we should offer something a little bit more unique and a little bit more advanced from everything else to show that the customer is really getting more from it. Being an EV, it’s probably likely to cost more than something with an engine, so we should reflect that in how it’s designed.’ The one-size-fits-all electric architecture used by the Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands: e-GMP. Interestingly, the EV3 launches as a front-wheel drive car. We’ve known it’s been possible to create that configuration from the start, but it’s the first time the configuration has been deployed on e-GMP so far. Like the boxy shape, the reason for doing so is down to that laser focus on maximising interior space – a single e-motor at the front is easier to package under the bonnet with the power electronics. Kia is launching the EV3 in two performance specifications: Standard Range and Long Range. Both are powered by a single 201bhp e-motor on the front axle, good for a 0-62mph sprint in 7.4sec or 7.7sec respectively. The EV3 tops out at 106mph. The only significant difference is the battery size; the Standard Range model has a 58.3kWh pack good for 255 miles, while the Long Range’s bigger 81.4kWh pack means a massive 372 miles claimed per charge is possible. Kia says the new EV3 launches with a new-generation battery management system to eke out as much range as the packs can, and both versions claim a circa-30-minute 10-80 per cent DC charge. The slight snag is that not every version gets a heat pump (which improves battery efficiency) as standard, and is relegated to being a £900 option only on the top-spec GT-Line S. As for trim levels, two have been confirmed when the prices went live: entry-level Air, upper GT-Line and top-end GT-Line S. Not necessarily. Look hard enough and yes, you can see where Kia’s tried to keep things, er, , but the overall design of the interior is clean, open and sensibly laid out. Naturally, Kia’s interior designers understand that you’ll be spending some of your time charging, so have included a centre console panel that slides forward to act as something slightly resembling a coffee table. . There’s some big car tech inside, too, and we mean that literally. The massive infotainment screen, for example, is lifted straight off the EV9 with no changes made, which keeps those economies of scale right up, and means you get the latest tech on board. While there’s a distinct lack of physical switchgear (aside from a row of buttons for quickly accessing sub-menus in the infotainment – boo, hiss, etc.), Kia’s made a conscious effort to include a fixed climate control menu area on the touchscreen. And, because it’s 2024 and seemingly everything must have it, Kia is including a generative AI voice assistant from December. The brand says there is a massive list of tech available, including a head-up display, the latest generation of the brand’s i-Pedal system (Hyundai/Kia-speak for a one-pedal driving mode) and digital key technology is available, freeing you from the need to keep the key fob on you. The EV3 also features vehicle-to-load functionality (allowing you to power devices from the car), as well as vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid capability. In an interesting move, Kia says it will also allow owners to customise the style of the instrument cluster beyond the standard Kia ones, providing a selection of designs themed around things like Star Wars or Marvel. Weird. Kia is also going hard on sustainability. The interior is completely leather-free, and there’s no chrome in here like you won’t find on the exterior, either. So much so that 28.5kg of recycled plastics can be found in every car, and Kia has included a QR code etched into the dashboard so you can find out where the materials have previously come from. Orders for the EV3 open on 1 August 2024. The range starts at £32,995 for an Air with a 58.3kWh battery, or £35,995 for one with the 81.4kWh pack. GT-Line starts at £39,945 and GT-Line S starts at £42,995 – both come with the 81.4kWh battery. Deliveries are expected to start towards the end of the year.

500,VW’s new ID.7 GTX streamliner EV costs from £62k in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-7-gtx/,Jake Groves,2024-07-30,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen is rolling out more of its GTX models, with the new VW ID.7 getting the warmed-up electric sub-brand treatment. First we saw the Tourer estate model, revealed at the same time as the . Now the ‘fastback’ hatch version has emerged from beneath the covers. The pair of go-faster ID.7 models go on UK sale in August 2024, priced from around £62k, with a modest £690 uplift to graduate to the wagon bodystyle: In general, the ID.7 GTX manages to become one of VW’s most powerful current models, with the Tourer estate version now becoming the brand’s highest-power estate ever. Those power claims hold up: the ID.7 GTX hatch and Tourer benefit from a total of 335bhp via two electric motors – more than a Golf R, or even something like the Passat R36 from the late 2000’s. A 0-62mph sprint isn’t quoted, but VW says the ID.7 GTX can top out at 112mph. The GTX version comes as standard with an 86kWh battery pack, promising a range of up to 388 miles on a charge. Up to 200kW DC charging is standard, too. As for the design, GTX models can be finished in this rather bold Kings Red. There’s quite a small colour palette available here: red, white, silver or black. Inside, the GTX model benefits from sporty seats finished in a microfibre-like material and flashes of red in the trimmings. GTX models naturally come with their own slightly sportier bodykit, with a bespoke daytime running light signature at the front and bespoke wheel designs. For the ID.7 GTX, a panoramic glass roof is standard that uses polymer-dispersed liquid crystals to transform the glass from transparent to opaque. And, like the ID.7 Tourer, both the front and rear VW badges glow bright at nighttime. VW says orders will open in August 2024, with first right-hand drive deliveries due in time for the new autumn 74 registration. Stay tuned for our VW ID.7 GTX review in the coming weeks.

501,Please welcome to the stage: the new Pagani Utopia Roadster,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/pagani/utopia-roadster/,Jake Groves,2024-07-30,Car Magazine UK,"‘Act Three, Scene Two.’ That’s how Pagani describes its new Utopia Roadster – the latest in a line of ultra-luxury, high-performance supercars following on from the Zonda, Huayra and the Utopia coupe. The new Utopia Roadster, you’ll be unsurprised to know, is a convertible version of that most recent car ( ), and it’ll make its public debut during . Pagani has a long history of creating engineering masterpieces, and this is no different. The brand proudly states that its V12 is ‘devoid of any hybrid support’ and comes armed to the teeth with finely-crafted touches and a whole load of exotic materials. Most notably, the Utopia Roadster weighs the same as the coupe. Not this time. Pagani says it has answered the (let’s be honest, rather in-the-clouds) ‘dilemma’ of those fortunate enough to be in the position between choosing a coupe or a roadster. The coupe is almost always seen as the purer choice, not least because of the usual weight penalty convertibles have, but Pagani has levelled the playing field here as the Utopia coupe and Roadster were designed in tandem, rather than one after the other. ‘This result was achieved thanks to a monocoque chassis entirely redesigned to optimize rigidity and resistance, without resorting to the heavy reinforcements usually required when a car roof is eliminated,’ says Pagani. As well as carbonfibre bodywork, the Utopia Roadster’s monocoque is made out of Pagani’s own ‘Carbo-Titanium’ material, with front and rear tubular subframes made from chromium-molybdenum alloy. That means the Roadster clocks in at 1280kg. Naturally, the Utopia Roadster follows the design cues of the coupe model. It’s still a familiar Pagani to look at; it’s low, wide, has a cosy passenger cell and finishes with a blunt rear end and four tailpipes arranged in the centre. In the example pictured, the colour is weaved into the carbonfibre bodywork and carbonfibre is deployed in the forged aluminium alloy wheels to act as air blades, forcing hot air out of the wheelarches. Inside, the design is as wild as it always is with a Pagani. Analogue instruments remain for the driver, something that Pagani says have been ‘all too quickly abandoned with the advent of digital displays’ and is inspired by fine watchmaking. The example pictures features a two-tone cream and tan upholstery combo, more red exposed carbonfibre and a luggage set to match. But of course. Naturally, these numbers are remarkably similar to the Utopia coupe. The Roadster uses a Mercedes-AMG-derived V12 developing 852bhp and 811lb ft of torque without any electrified assistance, good for an electronically-limited top speed of 217mph. Power is sent to the rear wheels either via a manual transmission or a seven-speed automated manual from Xtrac. An electro-mechanical differential is applied here, too. As well as summer and winter tyres offered by Pirelli, Brembo-derived carbon-ceramic brakes, with six-piston calipers at the front and four-piston ones at the rear. To make sure it handles like a proper supercar, the Utopia Roadster also boasts active suspension. Only if you’re wealthy enough to stump up €3.1m before local taxes, and manage to get in the rather short queue – only 130 are being made.

502,Recaro Automotive files for bankruptcy,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/recaro/,Jake Groves,2024-07-31,Car Magazine UK,"Recaro Automotive, most known for creating and manufacturing sports seats for cars on behalf of large car makers, has announced it is entering administration. The seat manufacturer, which is headquartered near Stuttgart, announced the news to its employees, union leaders and politicians on 30 July 2024. The brand is one of the most respected names in vehicle production, specialising in sports and performance seats for new cars. Many car makers have had working relationships with Recaro, including Ford, Mazda and Honda. In a statement, Recaro Automotive cites that it ‘encountered significant financial difficulties due to extreme price increases in recent crisis years and the loss of a major contract.’ ‘The effects of legacy products and business operations impacted the development of new product offerings during a regional reduction in vehicle purchase spend.’ Recaro Automotive says that it will continue to work as normal during the insolvency proceedings, and that it will ‘continue fulfilling all existing orders and new customer enquiries. ‘By working together as a team with our employees, suppliers, and customers through the possibility of an insolvency plan under the German Law we expect to stand on solid ground again in a timely manner.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

503,Driving the DarkRebel: how Cupra's supercar concept fits into the grand masterplan,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/cupra/darkrebel/,Georg Kacher,2024-08-01,Car Magazine UK,"There’s no mistaking this for some kind of rebadged Golf or ID. 3. The DarkRebel concept is an extraordinary-looking car – low, wide and mean. Crouch down to peer inside and the cabin looks futuristic enough to qualify as a work station for Darth Vader’s great grandson. The bucket seats are fixed, but thankfully the pedal box is adjustable. The same goes for the steering wheel – part yoke, part circular joystick, featuring two large rotary controls and a pair of busy touchpads. I clamber in. The short nose drops out of sight at the bottom of the panoramic windscreen, while the side windows are narrow enough to fire an arrow out of, but don’t give much of a view. A glance in the rear-view mirror shows a long, dark tunnel with a bright dot in the middle. The show car is a runner, but it doesn’t go fast. The turning circle would look unwieldy on a container ship, the front spoiler would be mangled by speed bumps, and those precious hand-made copper-over-carbonfibre wheels would be painfully prone to kerb rash. While the real thing – if it ever happens – is to be equipped with an animated centre display backed up by a smaller second screen above the twisted centre stack, this one-off is devoid of any functioning instrumentation, and the remote forward/reverse/park gear selector is housed in a little black box under the driver’s seat. What could possibly go wrong? So many things. But here goes. And it’s sensational, on several fronts: the thrill of that silent tap on the back, the raw acceleration rasp, the chafing brakes and the wow! effect this stingray has on bystanders – including Seat employees, who you might think would have got used to it. It’s an exciting departure for Cupra, which has emerged from Seat’s shadow to become Europe’s fastest growing car maker. Most of its success has been built on products that directly or indirectly are ultimately rebadged Golfs and ID. 3s. But what’s coming is much more interesting, and much more Cupra’s own. If it does get the nod, the most acclaimed work of chief designer Jorge Diez could become a near-supercar positioned a couple of rungs above the popular Formentor coupe-SUV, but so far Cupra CEO Wayne Griffiths has locked in neither the timing nor the funding. Perhaps more important still, he does not yet have the okay of the VW Group strategy board that ultimately decides who gets what, when, how many and at what cost. ‘I’d love an icon for sure, but right now we have other priorities which tie up the funds,’ says the Brit who’s run Cupra since 2018. It’s conceivable that the DarkRebel could be paired with one or more of the other sporty EV projects circulating within the group, not least the TT replacement that was our March cover star, and the Porsche Boxster and Cayman successors now expected in 2025. After all, MG has managed to put the Cyberster into production, and look at the positive vibes around that. Griffiths expects to make a decision within the next 12 months on whether to put the DarkRebel into production. Wouldn’t that be great? But then again, Cupra is doing just fine without a halo car. It currently out-performs its parent company, Seat, four to one in terms of profit margin. Rather than spending the mushrooming savings on a brand-shaping sports car, the Spaniards have more urgent matters to attend to. Like bringing fresh impetus to Seat, and launching half a dozen new models over the next four years; even preparing for a move into America, which is currently due to happen before the end of the decade and certainly won’t come cheap. A few years back, freshly appointed VW Group CEO Herbert Diess had dismissed Seat as a lost cause – boring cars, forgettable revenues, why bother? Cupra on the other hand seemed to him worth a try. The badge had been used on hot Seats since the mid ’90s, but became a fully fledged brand six years ago, a move led by Luca de Meo, who’s now CEO of Renault. The kick-off product, a go-faster version of the Ateca, was followed by the Leon hatch and estate in 2021. One month after Griffiths took the helm in October 2020, Cupra launched its first fully standalone model, the Formentor. Then the Born, based on the ID. 3, marked Cupra’s entry to the EV segment that will eventually become its sole battleground. Last year was the best so far for the combined Cupra and Seat. Deliveries increased by 50 per cent, every other car sold was a Cupra, and about two-thirds of the combined profit of more than €650m was netted by the challenger brand. On its way to becoming Europe’s fastest growing car manufacturer, its conquest rate is 75 per cent. Which all sounds great. But where are those conquest buyers coming from? An uncomfortable number of them are Audi customers. To find out more about Cupra’s success, about Seat’s next phase and about the bigger VW Group picture, we visit Casa Seat in the heart of Barcelona. This is not an old-school headquarters but a bigger and more colourful metamorphosis of the stylish City Garages which have been set up in nine European capitals, with three more to be added in 2024; spaces where the city meets the brands in a fun, stylish and interactive kind of way. Yes, if you want, you can stroll through showrooms and look at cars here, book a 24-hour test drive or check out . But the avant-garde steel-and-glass building on the busy Avinguda Diagonal also accommodates a part-time concert stage and exhibition space, a permanent tapas bar and restaurant, and a designer lounge area where customers and friends can meet and be merry. On the executive floor, the majority of managers look like they’re under 30. The open-plan office is dotted at random with desks, cosy seating arrangements, areas to read or relax in and two closed doors. One leads to the chairman’s office, the other to a large, generously glazed boardroom. The atmosphere is hip, the music loud, the lighting restless, the mood swinging between laid-back and over-revved. The message is both positively cosmopolitan and proudly Spanish. You walk through a melting pot of languages and nationalities, productive and upbeat, committed and optimistic, vibrant and restless. This all has a lot to do with CEO Griffiths. Now 58, the son of a Midlands car dealer is fluent in German and Spanish with a Catalan twang. He leads the company on a long leash, believing in flat hierarchies, quick decisions and maximum flexibility. But what about Seat? ? The answer comes like a shot: ‘Absolutely not! Cupra is earning the money Seat needs to reinvent itself. I gave the King of Spain my word that we are not going to kill Seat. And why should we? It is synonymous with cool, affordable cars – watch this space!’ Seat customers still prefer combustion engines, which will soon be complemented by advanced mild hybrids and long-range plug-in hybrids. Since the EV market share in Spain is hovering at a low 13 per cent (that’s half the EU average), Ibiza, Leon and the compact crossovers will get at least one more lease of life when their product cycles expire. The transition to battery power won’t happen for Seat before 2027 at the earliest. Cupra’s last non-BEV new model is the , on sale later in 2024. Based on the MQB platform, it will be offered with a choice of plug-in and mild hybrids. Also out in 2024 is its electric counterpart, the Chinese-built , which uses the group’s MEBevo underpinnings. The first models to use the all-new Scalable Systems Platform SSP will be the second-edition and the follow-up to the best-selling , both of which are still over five years away. What about the planned foray into micromobility as depicted by the Renault Twizy-style Seat Minimo design exercise? ‘It’s hard to make money on a minimalist vehicle like this,’ acknowledges Griffiths. ‘Perhaps Seat’s entry-level vehicle for young buyers needs to be a small no-frills electric car with a small cheap battery, because range is not of the essence here.’ He adds: ‘We embrace uncertainty, challenge the conventional, have the guts to make mistakes. We’re bold, authentic, generous – and firmly en route to become one of the 100 most valuable name plates worldwide.’ The next big thing for Cupra is the confirmed expansion into North America. At least initially, this will focus on the west and east coasts and selected metro hubs. Research has provided promising feedback. In the US, the marketing strategy is to sell not only online and through a select dealer body but also by establishing new, contemporary channels. The City Garage will get its American equivalent, and there will be an ever changing mix of pop-up and flagship stores. And, of course, interactive digital experiences everywhere all the time. If all goes according to plan, the Spanish underdog will begin building cars in the NAFTA zone in 2029. The Audi plant in Mexico could be one option; the VW factory in Chattanooga or a US greenfield site, in a location still to be determined, may also enter the equation. Product-wise, we should see a double whammy led by the next-generation Formentor twinned with a bigger SUV that could be related to the Audi Q6 Mk2. ‘I keep thinking of Cupra as a small boat, quick and nimble, always prepared to make a move the others don’t expect,’ says Griffiths, sporting his trademark Thom Browne jacket, white shirt, matching sneakers and blue jeans ahead of a meeting with union leaders. This will, he says, be a tough year. ‘But I’m confident we struck the right chord with the market by turning exceptional performance and stand-out design into a unique user experience. Although we are definitely on the right track, it takes a broader portfolio to co-author the next chapters of global mobility, and we also need sustainable volumes to make this thing fly. By that, I mean 100,000 cars minimum in the US and at least half a million units in total.’ It’s ambitious, and there may be casualties along the way, but recent success says the enthusiastic CEO’s instincts are good and the Cupra story has barely got into its stride – with much more potential waiting to be unleashed. One of the world's leading motoring journalists, Georg has been a staple on CAR magazine for six decades. Incredible, but true. This extraordinary experience means that Georg has probably scooped it, driven it and rated it before anybody else!"
504,The 2025 Volkswagen Transporter – first proper look at the popular medium van,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/transporter/,Tom Webster,2024-08-01,Car Magazine UK,"The all-new is on its way, with VW having finally decided it can’t drag out the drip-feeding of the teaser images its seventh-generation medium van. We now have the first official images of the popular commercial vehicle Despite the drawn-out reveal, we already knew a fair amount about the T7, because of its status as part of ‘Project Cyclone’ commercial vehicle alliance that has already produced the and . In this instance, Ford has taken the lead on the project, as it did with the Ranger, which means that the Transporter is going to be largely the same as the recently launched . This is a very good thing in some respects, as the new Ford has shot straight to the top of the class – if you are going to mirror something, make it the best out there. This means that the Transporter is getting a strong set of diesel engines, an electric version (read our to get more of an idea what this will be like), a variety of lengths and heights and some innovative features such as a flat cabin floor and an L-shaped bulkhead that will offer more storage space with two rows of seating. The latter is to be called the ‘Plus’ and will offer two seats and a narrow section of full-length loading bay. While the fundamental shape remains the same as the Ford’s, the first images show that VW has tried hard to give the Transporter its own identity, with it naturally taking on a fair amount of the passenger car range’s elements. According to VW Commercial Vehicles’ chief designer, Albert Kirzinger, ‘One second is all it takes to immediately recognise the Transporter – which has been redesigned from the first to last millimetre – as the successor to the T6.1 and as a member of the Bulli family.’ Bulli being the historic nickname for these vans in Europe. Kirzinger adds:  ‘The design consistently follows the iconic Bulli DNA. This is already evident in the main body, which has the characteristic contour for the product line below the side windows – we call it the Bulli line.’ While Kirzinger also says every new Transporter generation represents ‘a new interpretation’ (inevitable here due to the Ford relationship), he also points out a number of features that echo or pay homage to previous models. For instance, the shape of the front grille is influenced by the T5 generation, the T6.1 (the current model) shows up in the headlights. The Bulli line, which separates the upper and lower portions of the body is a clear throwback to the T1. Other design details revealed in the latest round of info includes the option of 16-, 17- and – yikes – 19-inch alloy wheels. The fuel filler flap is in the B-pillar, as usual, while the charging port for the plug-in hybrid and electric van variants is under the right headlight. The rear doors recessed into the bumper to create a low (ish) loading height of 575-638mm, depending on version. Despite all the design talk – and the 19-inch wheels – the new Transporter is still aiming to be a practical van, with a maximum carrying capacity of 1.33 tonnes and a top towing weight of 2.8 tonnes promised. These are the maximum figures and VW has yet to confirm the full range. However, if you want a good overall guide then again take a look at the Ford. There will be slight variances between the two, depending on trim and spec, though – the most basic Transit Custom can take more than 1,400kg for example. What is the same is the exterior and loadbay dimensions. Compared to the outgoing Transporter T6.1, the Transporter gets a boost in size all around. There are two lengths on offer, with wheelbases of 3100mm and 3500mm resulting in overall dimensions of 5050mm and 5450mm respectively. There will also be two heights, with the shorter sitting just under 2m and the taller sitting not far short of 2.5m. This results in interior loading capacity ranging between 5.8m3 and 9.0m3. This comes thanks to a rear loading bay that is 61mm longer than the old Transporter, and 148mm wider between the wheel arches, which makes it easier to store that ubiquitous measure of a van’s practicality, the Euro pallet. When it comes to passengers, there will be two individual seats as standard, but you can get three-, four-, five- and six-seater versions too. There should be a Kombi version in the future, too, with a third row of seats, taking capacity up to a maximum of nine. There will be a range of diesel engines to start off with, with the units the same as those in the Ford. There will be a 110hp, 150hp and 170hp option, with front-wheel drive the standard setup. However, you will also be able to get the two more powerful engines with rear-wheel drive as well. A plug-in hybrid, called eHybrid, will join the range later on. This will combine electric and petrol power to produce a total output of 233hp. There will also be an electric model, with four potential power outputs ranging from 116hp to 286hp, but it remains to be seen which will make it to the UK. The standard levels of equipment on the Transporter promise to be generous, with LED headlights and taillights, lane keeping assistance, autonomous emergency braking and an electronic parking brake with auto hold all expected to be included. There will also be a 12-inch digital instrument cluster and a 13-inch touchscreen on every version. The touchscreen system is likely to be the same as the Ford’s, even running on the same operating system, but with a VW twist. This means it might have different physical controls and VW’s own colours and fonts, even if it operates in the same way. It will come with DAB+ radio, online service, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The drawn-out process is set to continue a while yet, with the full camouflage not expected to be revealed until summer 2024 at the earliest. The first vans won’t then come to the UK until early 2025. Perhaps unsurprisingly we don’t have UK pricing details yet, but VW has confirmed that it will start at €36,780 in Germany – that’s around £31,500 or so. We’ll bring more information as it lands. Tom Webster is our Vans Editor, as well as being the Deputy Head of the Bauer Digital Automotive Hub, meaning he has a keen focus on all things vans and automotive ownership."
505,The Nilu27 hypercar is a 1000bhp-plus middle finger to electrification,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nilu27-hypercar/,Jake Groves,2024-08-08,Car Magazine UK,"Sasha Selipanov – an automotive designer who’s worked on cars like the and CC850 as well as and – has branched out on his own. Nilu27 is a new automotive brand, and this V12 hypercar is the first ground-up creation that’ll make its public debut during the 2024 Monterey Car Week. Straight off the bat, the Nilu27 is described as a car that seemingly says ‘f*** you’ to various trends in the automotive landscape in the 21 century like electrification, driver assistance and digital tech. Selipanov says the Nilu27 hypercar is one that ‘discards current trends and conventions in the pursuit of an elevated automotive experience.’ The bodywork is inspired by, er… everything, it seems; Le Mans racers, Bauhaus, American muscle cars and… ‘avant garde metal music.’ The result is a clean and hyper-aerodynamic shape that has shades of the Mclaren F1, Koenigsegg Gemera, Lamborghini Countach and Pagani Utopia. Exposed engineering elements, big scoops for air cooling and gullwing doors all feature. Inside, there’s a traditional two-seat layout (not a single-seater, or three-seat configuration) and a cacophony of manual dials. The Nilu team are keen to make everything as physical as it can be, including ‘cold-touch’ billet-machined switchgear, an open-gate manual transmission and elaborate, analogue driver’s instruments. Given the whole vibe of the Nilu27 hypercar is purity, the engine is a naturally-aspirated 6.5-litre V12 engineered by Hartley Engines. It’s an 80-degree, hot-vee V12 that includes 12 individual throttle bodies and a 3D-printed, Inconel 12-to-one exhaust header system that’s nicknamed the ‘snake pit.’ ‘Make no mistake, this is not an OEM engine from another manufacturer converted to the hot-vee’ says Hartley Engines CEO and founder, Nelson Hartley. ‘This is a bespoke, large bore, short stroke monster. It’s got aggressive cams, aggressive port flow, lightweight components and exotic materials. We want to get a cold sweat every time the V12 starts and revs.’ Carbon ceramic brakes from Brembo are standard, as well as Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tyres. And this isn’t just a one-off, it’ll make production. A 15-car launch run is planned, but these won’t be road legal; Nilu27 says it is ‘simultaneously developing a street homologated version,’ which will be limited to 54 units and ‘further evolve the design language.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

The B95 Gotham is one of four cars in a partnership between DC Comics and Automobili Pininfarina, and it will make its public debut at The Quail, an event within the 2024 Monterey Car Week. The others are a B95 Dark Knight, and a Battista in both the Gotham and Dark Knight specifications. ‘James Bond stands for Aston Martin, and now Automobili Pininfarina stands for Batman,’ chief design officer Dave Amantea tells CAR. ‘And this isn’t just a design exercise but a full experience – the engineering team realised something really special for our customer, and we’ve included the voice of Alfred the butler that welcomes them into the car.’ The Gotham-spec B95 is finished in a combination of a dark metallic grey and black, and features domes that are wrapped in the same high-grade leather seen in the interior. There are Wayne Enterprises logos embossed into those domes, and the B95 Gotham includes new wheel designs not seen before on an Automobili Pininfarina project. Some of the B95’s exquisite details remain, including the glowing Pininfarina logo and the fins pushing aero over the cockpit that have been inspired by the Ferrari Testarossa. Naturally, Automobili Pininfarina are jumping head-first into the DC universe by photographing the B95 Gotham alongside the Tumbler from the Christian Bale Batman trilogy, in the huge studio space that was used as a location in those movies, too. ‘This is the way that we communicate to the rest of the world who we are and what we are going to do,’ Amantea tells us, as well as the possibilities and opportunities Automobili Pininfarina have in our pockets.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017. With a decade of car news and reviews writing under his belt, he became CAR's Deputy News Editor in 2020 and then News Editor in 2025. Jake's day-to-day role includes co-ordinating CAR's news content across its print, digital and social media channels. When he's not out interviewing an executive, driving a new car for review or on a photoshoot for a CAR feature, he's usually found geeking out on the latest video game, buying yet another pair of wildly-coloured trainers or figuring out where he can put another car-shaped Lego set in his already-full house."
507,‘We test it until it breaks’: developing the new Toyota Land Cruiser,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/toyota/land-cruiser-minoru-takayama/,Ted Welford,2024-08-12,Car Magazine UK,"Of all the long-running models, the is perhaps the hardest to develop. Sold in more than 170 countries and the transport of choice for the UN and various aid agencies – not to mention some less savoury organisations – the Land Cruiser is a car that absolutely must be built to last. For generations it has been renowned for its ruggedness and capability. So how do you go about making one of the world’s toughest cars even tougher? You test it until it breaks, says Minoru Takayama, assistant chief engineer of the new Land Cruiser, known as the 250. ‘We have the kowashikiri process [literally, “destroyed” in Japanese], where we test something until a part breaks, and then you improve that and test it again to find the weak points. That process is unique to the Land Cruiser.’ Sounds drastic, but Takayama says that aside from some hardcore off-roading it’s not very different from the way any Toyota is developed. ‘The testing formula is very similar to other passenger vehicles. However, what they don’t do is the off-roader test. The Land Cruiser has to go anywhere, everywhere and come back in one piece.’ Specifically, it now has a disconnecting front anti-roll bar that allows for more wheel articulation (like the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon) and toughened diffs that can now unlock more quickly if it gets stuck. Unlikely, though – this is a Land Cruiser. As part of the big 4×4’s development, engineers work out which exposed parts should be designed to withstand a proper beating.  ‘Designing the underfloor is very difficult, and we focused on what aspects were touching the rocks and gravel. Preferably we avoid parts touching the ground [when extreme off-roading] but through the kowashikiri process we work out which parts are allowed to touch the ground and which can’t. We confirm this carefully with our testing.’ This new 250 Land Cruiser replaces the 150, and though the old car’s off-roading can’t be questioned, its on-road manners and interior left a lot to be desired. Toyota has addressed both of these and it’s a huge improvement; in many respects it seems to have been Defender-fied. Takayama disagrees. ‘The previous model had been designed to be more like a Land Rover but, for this latest model, we tried to get back to the origins – to bring back some of the Land Cruiser-ness.’ Takayama lives and breathes Toyota. He tells us about a trip when he was in primary school to a Toyota factory to watch the manufacturing process; that inspired him to join. His first car was a Toyota Sprinter Trueno, which you might know as an AE86. He even lives in Toyota City. ‘I only wanted, and only ever want, to work for Toyota.’ He has history with the Land Cruiser, having been in charge of the 150’s steering and brake pedal (two pretty important functions) and then led development of the air suspension of the flagship 300. What of the future? While the new 4×4 launches purely in diesel form in the UK, a mild hybrid will follow in 2025, though Toyota says this is to make it ‘smoother and quieter’, with any potential efficiency gains carefully glossed over. Other markets, such as America and China, will get a hybrid version, sharing a powertrain with the Tacoma pick-up. And an electric Land Cruiser? Well, you’ll have to wait a few years it seems. ‘As a company, we should see a battery-electric model [in order] to be carbon neutral, but today we cannot provide a battery for the Land Cruiser. We have to consider that it’s sold in 170 countries, and the Land Cruiser DNA is that it can go anywhere and everywhere and come back safe and well. That’s a very difficult point with electric. ‘In the far future, we need to consider battery-electric, but it needs to fulfil our Land Cruiser standards.’ There are three things he’s most proud of about this new car: its appearance, the way it drives and its performance. But Takayama is modest about what he and his team, overseen by chief engineer Keita Moritsu, have achieved. ‘We felt the pressure and it helped to develop us as people in the process. I’m very proud of being a part of the development, but we always have to be modest and humble. It’s a skill but there are always more things to do.’ ‘A Toyota Sprinter Trueno. I got it as soon as I got a licence at 20. I worked a part-time job to save money and get that car, and loved it very much and tuned it all by myself. I learned a lot  from that car.’ ‘I run a lot and often do marathons. In order to complete a marathon, you have to train hard and daily. I haven’t been able to do as many marathons recently as I’ve been busy working on the Land Cruiser. But I’ll do them again.’ ‘At an interview at a previous job I couldn’t answer any of the questions. That wasn’t good.’ ‘Actually, probably creating the air suspension of the Land Cruiser [the 300, not available in Europe] and improving it to be a good structure and reducing the weight.’ ‘I’d have a classic car, as they tell a lot more history.’ ‘The military? [Half right, as it was technically the National Police Reserve of Japan.] I’m going to check that later!’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
508,JLR’s letter: what Land Rover's doing to stop your older car getting nicked,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/jlr-land-rover-and-range-rover-security-fixes/,Seth Walton,2024-08-15,Car Magazine UK,"Jaguar Land Rover has dispatched a fresh round of security advice for some of its older cars, with free, up-rated smart key fob batteries on offer for qualifying owners, one has revealed. Outlined in a letter to the owner, the ‘sleeping’ batteries have a built-in motion sensor that will put the key into a sleep mode after three minutes of static inactivity. JLR says the batteries – which are available on a first come, first serve basis – are to provide an extra layer of protection against relay theft – a method by which thieves hijack the signal between a car and its key to unlock the doors. In addition to the new batteries, JLR is also supplying qualifying owners with signal-blocking Faraday pouches for keys to be stored in safely overnight. According to the manufacturer, the Faraday pouches are a sort of stop-gap to offer as much protection against relay theft as possible, before a fresh software update to prevent BCM theft – a hijack of the car’s body control module – arrives later this year. The software update that will bring the older cars’ BCM protection in line with that of the newer crop, Jaguar Land Rover says. In response to the letter, a JLR spokesperson told CAR: ‘The UK vehicle theft issue is affecting all manufacturers. We understand how deeply distressing being a victim of car crime is, so we have invested £15m to update more than 216,000 previous-generation and out of warranty vehicles so they have the highest levels of security – revisiting older models is unprecedented in the automotive industry. ‘Going back to as far as 2016 vehicles, our engineers are developing software compatible with older systems and hardware, and we have provided physical theft prevention tools as an interim measure. ‘We will continue working to reduce the scale and impact of vehicle crime and through our close collaboration with police, we work to stay ahead of any emerging methods.’ JLR has also pledged an additional £1m to bolster proactive policing efforts. The firm says it wants to support several police forces with extra resources, plus a dedicated intel group to help bring down theft rates in certain hotspots. CAR was invited to JLR’s base earlier this year, to discuss the ways in which the brand has tried to combat high theft rates, and what the plans are for the future. See below to read more on JLR’s anti-theft strategy. Jaguar Land Rover has outlined the steps it’s taking to improve security measures on its vehicles, including the line-up and Land Rover Defender, with both new and older models eligible for an update. The manufacturer has come under increased scrutiny in recent months over how many of its cars are stolen – and many insurance companies are refusing to offer cover owing to the alleged ease of entry. It’s a sign of the growing problems with faced by all manufacturers. Land Rover hit back this week, disclosing proof that the Range Rover is not the most stolen car in the UK, nor do any JLR models place within the top three. According to JLR, the risk of theft is significantly higher for its older models – specifically those built between 2016 and 2018, and some built in 2019. But, conversely, theft rates on newer vehicles have been significantly lower, its data show. Just 0.08% of the latest generation of Range Rovers sold have been stolen in the UK since the model was launched just over two years ago – that’s 11 cars. For the , 0.1% of vehicles sold in the UK have been stolen (15) and 0.3% of (134 cars). Despite the falling figures, JLR has made a huge investment into new security kit for its cars while working with police forces across the country to help tackle car theft on a national scale. We spoke to the teams responsible for security to find out what’s being done at Gaydon to make their cars theft-proof. Keyless locking systems have become a known weak point in car security systems. Previous generations of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport (especially those built between 2016 and 2018) were susceptible to relay car theft. This method involves two thieves using signal-hijacking equipment to replicate the signal from a car’s key to open the car door and even start the engine – all while the key remains inside the house. However, since 2018, JLR has employed Ultra-Wide Band radar technology in its keys and vehicles to detect just how close the key is to the car before allowing it to open. To unlock the doors, the key must now be right next to the car before its validity is recognised. According to chief electrical engineer Stewart Moore, Ultra-Wide Band keys have effectively ‘killed off’ relay hackings on JLR cars as no one has yet figured out how to overcome the technology. As relay car thefts have waned, body control module (BCM) hacking cases have risen to take their place. Once a car has been unlocked, thieves are plugging a BCM hacking device – street valued at around £25,000 – into the on-board diagnostics (OBDII) port then programming a key ID into the body controller to start the vehicle. ‘This is what my team has spent the last two or three years trying to address,’ Moore added. ‘We’ve overcome it with a body module control software update. There’s now a form of customer authorisation required before key programming is allowed to take place.’ According to Moore, it can be authorised by one of two ways. Either the car can be put into service mode via the control app or there is a valid key detected inside the car to soft unlock the body control module. ‘This has been the game changer from our perspective. This is why the theft rate on new Range Rovers and the Range Rover Sport is as low as it has been as, to date, thieves still haven’t found a way around it.’ Along with the introduction of ultra-wide band technology, JLR has updated its vehicle keys and remote security systems with additional locking capabilities to curb opportunistic thefts when the car is particularly vulnerable. Say, while in a car park or at a petrol station. On newer cars like the Range Rover Sport (below), if you press the lock button once, the car will single lock to activate the perimeter alarm and turn on the intrusion sensors. In this mode, if the car window is smashed or the door opened, the alarm will fire. If the button is pressed twice in three seconds, the car will double-lock, meaning that if a window is smashed to open the door from the inside, it won’t unlock. New Range Rovers will receive walk-away locking technology that locks the car automatically once it detects the key has left a 2.5-metre perimeter. There’s also a new security feature in the control remote app known as Guardian Mode that will notify the owner if their car is tampered with in any way when parked up. JLR is using risk data provided by insurance partners to identify which the most high-risk models are and where they’re located. These are the vehicles that have been targeted for the software updates first, though the manufacturer is going back to 2016 models to cover as many customers as possible. Lee Walton, head of JLR’s Vehicle Theft Reduction Group, said: ‘Going back to 2016 model year, they’re cars that are coming up to 10 years old and have been out of warranty for six and seven years. It’s a huge group of cars to go over, but shows the focus that we’re putting into making these cars resilient for our clients.We want them to be secure, we want them to have a great ownership experience and we want them to get competitive insurance.’ According to Walton, the update only takes 20 minutes at a main dealer. Vehicles too old to benefit from ultra-wide band technology are being retrofitted with a dormant additional GPS tracker called Tracker Retrieve that’s available on the aftermarket as part of a five-year subscription package. JLR is also working with consumers to install the best aftermarket immobilisers, but Lee Walton suggested that consumers should pick their immobiliser based on advice from their insurer as different firms have unique preferences on immobilisers to help benefit premiums. JLR has been working with the police and government to outlaw the key programming tools that thieves use to steal cars. Historically, such devices have been considered part of the automotive locksmithing toolbox, but JLR has worked to pass legislation that recognises them as tools for theft. The Criminal Justice Bill that proposes these changes is currently making its way through Parliament and is at the end of the committee stages, ready for the House of Lords. The manufacturer is also investing heavily in additional port security while working in conjunction with other law enforcement teams, analysing each car theft case to identify where measures can improve.

509,BMW M5 Touring revealed: monster performance meets wholesome practicality,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m5-touring/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-08-15,Car Magazine UK,"It’s finally here! You’re looking at the M5 Touring, a thumping steak of engineering from Munich’s increasingly busy M-division. There are no surprises here; it’s heavy, practical, shares butch styling with the just revealed M5 and it’s mind-bendingly quick – you can for just how quick. Keep reading for all the specs and other details. It does, but that’s no surprise because it borrows the same formula as the standard M5 and adds a little more practicality. At 5096mm long and 1970mm it has an identical footprint to the saloon, but grows 75mm wider at the front arches and 45mm wider at the rear ones, when compared to the normal Touring. Overall its 36mm longer and 70mm wider than the standard car. BMW’s designers have tried to reduce the illusion of weight and size by adding tapering lines along the side of the car. Do they work? We’ll leave it up to you to decide. At the rear, the M5 Touring also gets a gaping two-section diffuser to push it to the ground – or at least look aggressive – and there’s a roof spoiler too for extra downforce. Just like the saloon, the M5 Touring also gets BMW’s new illuminated grille outline. The M5 Touring uses the same hybrid system as the saloon: an electric motor with a 18.6kWh battery puts energy through the gearbox, along with a 4.4-litre V8 – though the two can work independently: in EV-only mode, range varies from 38 to 42 miles. Power is limited to 195bhp and 206lb ft with a 87mph top speed when you’re only tapping into the electric motor, but unleash the turbocharged 4.4-litre V8 too, and you get a combined 717bhp and 738lb ft. That works out to a 0-62mph sprint of 3.6 seconds (just 0.1 slower than the saloon) while 124mph comes in just 11.1 seconds. Top speed is limited to 155mph but can be unlocked to 189mph if you opt for the M Drivers’ package. Munich’s engineers have also spent time on the chassis. There’s double wishbone front axle up front, and the underside of the car is also braced with M-specific shear elements front and rear, all designed to keep torsional rigidity as high as possible. The M5 Touring also gets near-50:50 weight distribution. As you’d expect, there are a range of modes available as in the saloon, ranging from hybrid to electric and e-Control (which works on maintaining battery charge). There’s also a track mode, a dynamic mode and an all-out dynamic plus mode for qualifying laps. In an estate. Anyway, like other M cars, BMW will let drivers play around with the car’s performance brain, with a range of parameters around DSC customisable to the nth degree. The M ethos aims for performance outside but luxury within, and the M5 Touring nails the brief. There are M multifunction seats that are both heated and ventilated (passengers up front and an optional panoramic roof is also available to add more natural light to the cabin. You’ll find all the usual semi-autonomous features under the hood including Parking Assistant Professional, that will cover distances of up to 200m when slotting the BMW into a space for you. Like the standard car, most functions are pinned to a huge, curved display. The M cars get a Bowers & Wilkins sound system included as standard. Order books are open now, and the M5 Touring will cost £112,500. If you do put your name down, expect a delivery in early 2025 after assembly in BMW’s Dingolfing plant – alongside the saloon.

510,"New Lambo revealed: Temerario hybrid gets 907bhp and revs to 10,000rpm!",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lamborghini/temerario/,James Dennison,2024-08-16,Car Magazine UK,"Depending on which translation you believe, the latest Lamborghini – called the Temerario – translates as reckless, rash or daredevil. In other words, exactly what you expect from a Sant’Agata supercar. It’s also not a huge surprise to see the spine-tingling dropped (RIP) for a smaller, yet more powerful 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 plug-in hybrid. After all, if even its flagship hypercar isn’t safe from hybridisation then its little sibling surely must go the same way. For Lamborghini, hybrid is by the preferable option when the alternative is full EV. Company CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, was quoted as saying ‘we don’t see hybrid technology as bridging tech anymore, we see it as something that could be here to stay. In our opinion, the supercar should stay hybrid as long as possible’. Some endorsement from the man at the top, and of course Lambo’s take on PHEV is more eye-catching than most… We’ll start with some numbers. Because even by today’s standards of amply powered EVs, the Temerario still stands out. On its own, the engine makes 789bhp and 538lb ft of torque, but together with the three axial flux electric motors (two on the front axle, one sandwiched between the engine and eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox) total outputs are even more mind-blowing. Remember when the Gallardo initially released with circa 500bhp and the with 600bhp, that seemed like a lot? The Temerario blows that away with 907bhp. Together with all-wheel drive, that means standing launches to 62mph take just 2.7 seconds (0-125mph in just 7.3 secs) and top speed is quoted as 213mph. Perhaps most impressive of the lot however is the way the Temerario promises to rev. Twin-turbo V8s don’t tend to rev especially high, but Lamborghini’s unit doesn’t hit the limiter until 10,000rpm. Impressive stuff. And – less important – the 3.8kWh is probably good for around 9 miles of EV range, not that anyone is especially fussed given Lambo is very clear that it’s their for performance rather than efficiency. Charging takes 30 mins on a 7kW charge and six mins from the engine itself. As for the gearbox, an eight-speed DCT transmission is installed transversally in behind the twin-turbo V8. In order to save space and weight, an additional hollow shaft is used to share the same synchronisers for different gear torque paths, meaning a number of electrical components can be jettisoned. Hence why the eight-speed DCT in the Temerario weighs less than the Huracan’s seven-speed DCT yet achieves faster shift times. Well, we can’t be sure yet. Our experience hearing the engine was from static revving in a sound-deadened room (never the best way to showcase a car’s lungs) and from a computer simulator. From these early impressions, we’d be very confident in saying that the new V8 won’t be on the same level as the V10 – big surprise – but equally there’s a lack of characterful intake noise, while the in-car sound symposer seems to do plenty of heavy lifting. We’ll wait to make our final judgement once we’ve heard the engine under load! If the engine sound isn’t quite what you were expecting, there shouldn’t be anything about the styling that doesn’t fit in the Lamborghini playbook. Loud, angular and a little on the crazy side, it’s a worthy follow-on to the Huracan and, in some ways, is even more extreme. Walk around to the rear end for example and while there’s no huge spoiler (yet), the diffuser makes up for that. As vast as it is aggressive and punctuated by a GT3-esque fog light, it provides the perfect complement to the letterbox single exhaust and ludicrous cut-away wheel arches. The hexagonal lights, too, are a wonderful piece of detail. Of course, all of that isn’t for show. Rear downforce is up 103% compared with the Huracan EVO, going up to 158% when the lightweight Allegeritta Pack is specced. This offering a saving of up to 27kg (much carbon involved) and increased aero load by 67%. Further forward there’s huge side radiators that guzzle airflow carefully channelled via elements such as the wing mirrors and DRLs (with their own built-in intakes and deflectors). Four-pot calipers at the rear and ten (!) at the front mean the stopping distance from 62mph is just 32m.  Admittedly, that’s 1m further than the Huracan Performante but when you factor in that car’s dry weight of 1,382kg versus the Temerario’s 1,690kg it’s a whole lot more impressive. Too heavy for a supercar? We’ll see. It was obvious when the Revuelto launched that Lamborghini had spent a of cash on the cabin, so it was hardly going to rip that up and start again when it came to the Temerario. As such, it’s very similar to big bro with three screens across the interior (digital dash, central infotainment and passenger information display), a whole lot of hexagons and no shortage of space. In fact, Lamborghini’s been on a mission to drop the notion that its cabins are super compromised, cramped cockpits for two highly flexible individuals. For example, the Temerario’s new aluminium space frame (torsional stiffness is up 24% FYI) improves headroom by 34mm, legroom by 46mm and even grants enough space for 18-way electrically adjustable heated and cooled seats. But what we really like about the cabin is the appreciation of the humble button and switches. To some, the steering wheel might look a touch busy, but crucially the number of physical controls mean everything is clear and easy to control. No fumbling with touch pads or sliders, everything is operated very deliberately. This includes the drive modes, of which there’s five (Città, Strada, Sport, Corsa and Corsa Plus) and the powertrain settings (Recharge, Hybrid and Performance), as well as another dial for drift mode – of course. Something else that caught our attention is the LAVU system. Sounds like a disease, but it actually stands for Lamborghini Vision Unit. It uses three 4K cameras and provides features such as – Lamborghini Telemetry 2.0, Memories Recorder and Dashcam. The first is a continuation of a feature seen in the Huracan STO and records circuit sessions and telemetry at over 150 circuits around the world, even displaying tire pressures and ESC intervention, as well as the user’s heart rate thanks to Apple Watch integration. Meanwhile, the Memories Recorder can be used to capture the expressions of unsuspecting passengers the first time they feel the might of 907bhp, while the dash cam function is, well, a dash cam… No word yet from Lamborghini on how much the Temerario will cost, but don’t be surprised to see a highly specced version list at over £300k. The final Huracan will roll off the production line later in 2024, with deliveries of the Temerario expected in 2025.

511,Singer who? Porsche reveals first-ever factory-built one-off – and it’s a Sonderwunsch 911 Speedster,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/911-speedster-993-sonderwunsch/,CJ Hubbard,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Forget all those reimagined, remastered and backdated out there – from this point on, if you want a truly special example you’re only going to be at the top of the game if you have Porsche build it for you. This 993-based 911 Speedster debuting at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering during is the first ever example of a factory one-off, making it the latest and arguably greatest ultimate expression of Porsche Sonderwunsch. Sonderwunsch translates as ‘special wishes’ and it’s the department within Porsche that handles truly bespoke requests – actioned by Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur or Porsche Classic, depending on the requirements. It makes paint-to-sample seem blasé. There are a number of extremely highly developed factory Porsches out there – prolific has always previously claimed to have ‘the most customised’ example in the form his (literally) last-of-the-line 930 Turbo Cabriolet Flachblau. But this new 911 Speedster Type-993 conceived and now owned by Italian designer Luca Trazzi is the first ever unique body design Sonderwunsch has produced. According to Porsche, there are two other one-off 993 Speedsters (if that even makes sense) – one built for Ferdinand Alexander Porsche in 1995 and another created in 2001 for Jerry Seinfeld. So the lines are a little blurry. But this is still the first ever Sonderwunsch factory ‘restoration’ that’s resulted in such a creation; based on a 1994 car, it has unique technical and design features. The wider point is more that the 993 generation never had a series Speedster variant in the way that other Porsche models have. This is relevant, because Trazzi is, it would appear, something of a Speedster nut, in the nicest possible sense. With an impressive collection of existing models, the idea of creating his very own 993 variant as a means of completing the set became irresistible. Accordingly, he not only created his own concept design, he arrived at the first meeting with Porsche with an entire project book full of drafts and sketches. His personal involvement with the project, alongside key Porsche Sonderwunsch personnel, was so extensive that he was even issued with his own Porsche works ID. Typically these models not only lose the roof but also feature cut-down windscreens and specially redesigned rear ends. It was a particular challenge to get that part right in this case, apparently, as Porsche was keen to marry its production standards with Trazzi’s design. The screen and rear lid are bordered in black, another Speedset cue, while this car features door mirrors inspired by 1960s racers on the on hand and four-point daytime running lights inspired by modern Porsches on the other. There are elements of 993 Turbo about the look as well, though it’s the unique yellow paint that’s most eye-catching of all. This is called Otto Yellow, spontaneously named after Trazzi’s dog. We’ll try not to overthink that one. Other unique features come on the inside – this being the first 993 with illuminated carbon door sills, for example. The chequered seats are hand sewn, and there’s a matching touring bag to go in the matching luggage compartment. The switches have been redesigned with a Speedster sideline, and there’s a one-off gilded badge on the dashboard. Elsewhere inside there’s carbon trimmings and the retro-fit Porsche Classic Communications Management infotainment system, which adds satnav and Apple CarPlay. This has a bespoke start-up screen, of course. Just to really rub it in, this unique Speedster has the engine, chassis, steering and brakes from a 993 Carrera RS. When new, this was the most powerful Porsche engine, an air-cooled 3.8-litre boxer six with 296bhp.        No word on exactly how quick this makes the Speedster, but we suspect the feel of driving the thing is the real element of excitement here. Plenty of modern cars will be quicker, surely few will feel as visceral or authentic. Bellissima.

512,Maserati’s MC20 GT2 Stradale is a whole lotta angry,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/maserati/mc20-gt2-stradale/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Maserati has pulled the covers off its latest MC20 variant: the GT2 Stradale. As the name suggests, it’s a road-going version of its hardcore GT2 racing car. The new MC20 variant has been unveiled at 2024’s version of The Quail, one of the many events during the 2024 Monterey Car Week. As you’d expect from the name, the GT2 Stradale is a pretty serious bit of kit. Maserati says it smashes together its two personality halves – ‘elegance and racing’ – and features the most powerful version of the Nettuno V6 deployed in so many modern Maseratis. With the GT2 Stradale, the V6 engine develops 631bhp, good for a 2.8sec 0-62mph sprint and a top speed of 201mph. Naturally, because it’s heavily inspired by the GT2 race car, there’s a lot of standard and pretty hardcore fixed aerodynamics that have been added to the Stradale model. A more aggressive splitter at the front, as well as a large fixed rear wing are both standard. All of that serious aerodynamic work means the GT2 Stradale generates up to 500kg of downforce, albeit only really accessible at a 174mph speed. The GT2 Stradale uses the same carbonfibre structure as the race car, and includes carbonfibre air ducts and rear wing to keep things light. Given it’s also a 21 ceuntury supercar, the MC20 GT2 Stradale is beriddled with software and drive modes. This model goes beyond the standard MC20 model with a new Corsa mode that splits itself into five different versions with increasingly hardcore attributes. Standard Corsa model still, for example, has full ABS and some use of the traction control; Corsa ‘1’ has the traction control turned off, the limited-slip differential slackened and even the ABS curbed. New colours launch with the GT2 Stradale, and there’s even more Alcantara inside. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

513,Rolls-Royce’s Phantom Scintilla has a ceramic Spirit of Ecstasy,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rolls-royce/phantom-scintilla/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Rolls-Royce has announced its latest craftsmanship project: the Phantom Scintilla. This low-volume commission has been created to celebrate the famous Spirit of Ecstasy, the Rolls-Royce mascot. Just 10 Phantom Scintilla models are being created, with the crown jewel of the creation being a Spirit of Ecstasy made out of ceramic. Rolls-Royce says the use of ceramic for the Scintilla model is a nod to the original inspiration for the Spirit of Ecstasy: the Greek sculpture, ‘The Winged Victory of Smothrace.’ If you’re not a Greek history buff, the sculpture was discovered on the island of the same name and currently stands in the Louvre museum in Paris. With regards to the Spirit of Ecstasy, then-MD Claude Johnson commissioned illustrator Charles Sykes to create a mascot for the luxury car brand. Sykes took inspiration from the sculpture, but made it more delicate. The Scintilla models all come finished in a two-tone colour combo: Andalusian White and Thracian Blue with hand-painted coachlines and wheel pinstripes. Inside, the Scintilla’s ‘gallery’ element is called ‘Celestial Pulse’ and uses ribbons of solid aluminium arranged into a piece of art. Rolls-Royce says 869,500 stitches are present in the rear half of the car. On top of that, the brand’s Starlight Headliner – an option you can spec on any current Rolls-Royce – has been given bespoke animations meant to mirror the Spirit of Ecstasy’s flowing gown.

514,Targamerica: the first topless Battista hypercar is a Miami Vice dream,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/pininfarina/targamerica/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Automobili Pininfarina has unveiled what it’s calling the first ‘the world’s first coachbuilt electric hypercar’ with this: the one-off Targamerica. The covers have come off the new version at The Quail, one of the regular events at . The new owner of the Targamerica is already a regular Automobili Pininfarina client. CEO Paolo Dellachà confirmed to CAR that ‘they already have an Anniversario model, and he’s one of the 10 deposit orders for a B95. He’s very sophisticated, and wants the best of the best.’ As it turns out, the best of the best happens to be this one-off Battista creation. Targamerica is the first ever convertible Battista model, fitted with a targa-top fabric roof for occasional bad weather, and will spend its life by the coast in the States – hence the name. AP chief of design, Dave Amantea, as well as the client and the atelier team at Pininfarina S.p.A were inspired by another Pininfarina one-off: the 1986 Ferrari Testarossa Spider created for Fiat chairman, Gianni Agnelli. To connect the Battista to the Testarossa, the Targamerica has a neat and reserved silver paint scheme with blue striping. Inside, however, things get more interesting. As well as tan upholstery and a bespoke luggage set, the Targamerica features a cigar humidor between the seats. Picture it now: cigar on the go, neon lights, skyscrapers and sandy beaches… the whole Miami Vice vision in one car. Automobili Pininfarina is aiming to create more bespoke Battista and models in the future, with its recent project being a collaboration .

515,R is for… corners? New Rimac Nevera R revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rimac/nevera-r/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Rimac has unveiled a new iteration of its electric Nevera hypercar: this is the Nevera R. The new Nevera R has been unveiled at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering during . ‘When we developed the Nevera, an important part of the brief was that it should be a Grand Tourer,’ says Mate Rimac, founder and CEO of Rimac, ‘But we’re relentlessly tweaking to customers’ desires, and many were looking for a car that really emphasized the Nevera’s cornering ability, using all the advanced technology on-board. We responded with the Nevera R.’ Naturally, then, the Nevera has had a solid going over. The Nevera R almost looks like a redesign of the standard car, with a much more aggressive front end that’s designed to ‘emphasise aerodynamic efficiency.’ And, focusing on aero, the new and rather large rear wing and rear diffuser are claimed to increase downforce by 15 per cent and overall aerodynamic efficiency by 10 per cent. New wheel designs feature here and are shod in Michelin Cup 2 tyres; Rimac says the R features a new-generation torque vectoring system designed to work with the new rubber. The Nevera’s drift mode has been tweaked here, too, and the steering system has been revised. It’s not just aero and looks, either. The Nevera R comes with a power bump, raising total system outpot to 2078bhp (over 1888bhp for the standard car) meaning a 0-62mph time of just 1.81sec, and a 0-186mph time in 8.66sec. Rimac says the Nevera R is 3.8sec faster around the Nardo test track than a standard Nevera. Just 40 will be made, and they’re likely to go about as lightning fast as the car itself.

516,Cadillac’s V-Series goes electric with Opulent Velocity concept,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/cadillac/opulent-velocity/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"It’s buzzword o’clock over at Cadillac with its new Opulent Velocity concept. The luxury American brand has been busy pondering how to electrify and design its future V-Series cars, and this is our first look. The Opulent Velocity concept has been unveiled at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering during the . It’s an evolution of Cadillac’s current and quite impactful design language, keeping design highlights like the vertical headlights and low-and-long profile seen on the Celestiq. But the design team have jam packed it full of interesting details. Cadillac says it’s taken a lot of design inspiration from the V-Series R hybrid racer seen in world endurance racing, rather than the current ( ) V and Blackwing production cars currently on sale. Self-opening butterfly doors feature, as does a slightly trippy 3D lights both front and rear, adding some theatre to the otherwise sleek and clean bodywork. The paint colour is called Gilded Pearl. As you walk towards the concept car and those butterfly doors open, you’ll see a super clean interior finished a dark, almost metallic blue. The seat are trimmed with ornate stitching patterns and, frankly, look a bit uncomfortable. As well as a steering wheel that looks like it’s been stolen from a TIE Fighter, Cadillac says being inside is designed to ‘keep the sense of luxury that has become synonymous with V-Series.’ A Velocity mode allows you to drive the car yourself using that steering ‘wheel’ and pedals the old fashioned way, or it can transport you using its onboard Level 4 autonomy technology. A full-width augmented reality head-up display in the windscreen will provide you with entertainment while on the road. Will it be a real thing? Very likely not. But as Cadillac prepares its first electric V-Series model, we’ll likely see hints of it in future production cars.

517,The fanciest SL ever? Mercedes-Maybach SL Monogram Series revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/maybach-sl-monogram/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-Maybach has revealed its latest creation: the SL Monogram Series, upping the luxury ante for Merc’s two-seat roadster. The SL Monogram Series launches with two ‘ambiences’ – not colours or themes, commoners – and debut with a lot of Maybach-specific detailing and colours. Both feature Maybach-specific details like bespoke and be-spoked wheels, a Maybach bonnet ornament and grille at the front and unique graphics inside. Towards the rear, Maybach Monogram models benefit from double-scoop sculptured pieces that are placed behind the headrests in a nod to classic roadsters of the past. The Red Ambience model (pictured) features a two-tone paint scheme with Obsidian Black and Mercedes Manufaktur Garnet Red, which Maybach says is designed to embody, er… ‘sensuality, beauty and lightness.’ Okay then. Both SL Monogram versions are called SL 680, meaning a more demure spec than an AMG model but still featuring the powerful V8 from the AMG 63 model. That means 577bhp is available, and you can surge your way up to 62mph in 4.1 seconds. Maybach is slowly gaining more of a foothold within the Mercedes group, with a wider range of Maybach-named models now than within the last 20 years. These SL Monogram Series versions launch in Europe in 2025, which will please likely only the small handful of people that will care and/or be wealthy enough.

518,"Monterey Car Week 2024: the new car A-Z from Pebble Beach, The Quail and more",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/monterey-car-week/2024/,Jake Groves,2024-08-17,Car Magazine UK,"Quite possibly the most glamorous collection of car shows and events – Monterey Car Week – is back for 2024. The week consists of a huge number of exhibitions, motor shows and concours events, as well as plenty of car auctions. This is the place where, usually, the most expensive cars in the world have ever been sold. Particularly large jewels in the Monterey Car Week crown include , the Monterey Motorsports Reunion at nearby Laguna Seca and much more un-serious events like the fantastic . More recently, Monterey Car Week has been home to plenty of concept and production car unveilings from premium, sports and luxury car makers. The 2024 week is shaping up to be no different. A tall, sleek crossover EV concept car graces Acura’s stand at the Quail and the Pebble Beach Concours this year. Acura, the posh Honda spin-off available in North America, says a real production car from this concept will launch towards the end of 2025. Restoration engineers are out in force for Monterey Car Week, including those at Arcade Cars. You might not have heard of Arcade, but the team there have come in with a heavy-hitter: a fully-restored and resto-modded classic G-Class that now runs on e-power. Automobili Pininfarina has had history with Monterey Car Week – it’s where it has unveiled both the electric Battista hypercar and the roofless B95 barchetta. This year, The AP team shows off this ‘one-of-one client commission for a renowned collector and existing Battista owner.’ One of four in a collection inspired by Bruce Wayne, Batman’s alter-ego. Automobili Pininfarina has joined forces with DC Comics and has worked on a set of cars that are a nod to the Caped Crusader. This B95 Gotham spec will make its public debut at The Quail this year. What’s being classed as the fourth-generation Bentley Continental GT makes its way across to North America for the first time. CAR understands that this new Conti will only be sold as an electrified model regardless of market. Also, the green looks better in person than it does in the stock images – we promise. The team running the Pebble Beach Concours event have officially confirmed that the super-estate based off the new, plug-in hybrid M5 will be among the show cars. Not a confirmed one, as Cadillac hasn’t been explicit about the Sollei making its debut here. But revealing a one-off, super luxurious concept car that’ll massively appeal to the Pebble Beach crowd a few weeks before Monterey Car Week starts? It’s a shoo-in that it’ll make an appearance. This is essentially a first look at how a future V-Series electric car from Cadillac could look. It’s very much standard concept car fare: silly doors, big wheels, tech that’s still some years away on board. Looks great, though. A design house that’s reshaping the Diablo for the 21 century. Eccentrica says the Diablo project is designed to keep the design ‘period correct’, but swapping out materials for more high quality ones and giving the car’s powertrain an extra kick. Maurizio Reggiani, former chief technical officer of Lamborghini, is among the team. The team known for converting and restomodding Porsche 911 and Ford GT40 models to run on electric will be showcasing its wares during CAR week. As well as two 964-generation 911s, a SL Pagoda and Land Rover Series IIA will be attracting attention. We’ve driven an Everrati 911 conversion – . A coupe and convertible launch at The Quail that’s designed to promote Hennessey’s, er… specialness. Each one of these ‘Stealth Series’ coupe or convertible models cost around $3m a pop, but it also does claim to be one of the fastest cars in the world. The brand’s Huracan replacement has finally arrived. The new super sports car from Sant’Agata is a pretty serious bit of kit, with more than 900bhp from its plug-in hybrid powertrain and an engine that screams its way up to 10,000rpm. Another attendee could be the brand’s facelifted, plug-in hybrid SUV. The SE replaces both the standard Urus and Performante version, and boasts 789bhp from its electrified V8. A car that smashes together the charm and charisma of a Maserati supercar and the brand’s motorsport heritage. That is, of course, according to Maserati. The new, hardcore MC20 version still uses the Nettuno V6, and is described as a car that is ‘destined to be on the wishlist of customers attracted by the most extreme super sports cars.’ Through clever engineering and materials, Pagani has made a convertible version of its Utopia supercar that clocks in at exactly the same weight. The exclusive supercar brand has confirmed the Utopia Roadster will make its public debut during the course of the week. Porsche Something Porsche doesn’t really do very often: allow individuals to commission and create their own car. This creation is a 993-based car, but inspired by more modern Speedsters seen on later 911 and Boxster models. A special edition designed to celebrate 50 years of the turbocharged 911, believe it or not. Don’t hold your breath – it’s entirely cosmetic and, frankly, a bit boring. A bit of a surprise, this one. Rimac has gone back to the drawing board with its Nevera hypercar, creating something that’s even more powerful than before. But power isn’t the key here: the R is designed to be a better handling machine, with improved aero and better tech.

519,Facelifted Audi RS3 gets new look (and more oversteer) for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/rs3/,Ted Welford,2024-08-19,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has revealed the facelifted version of its RS3 hot hatch, getting a revised look, interior updates and performance upgrades for 2024. Following on from , Audi’s baby RS model is the next to get a nip-and-tuck to keep it competitive next to its arch rival, the , both among the you can buy. Audi also recently set a new for the ‘compact class’ with a disguised version and you can watch it in our video lower down this page. Now, the wraps have been pulled off it ahead of going on sale in September 2024, with UK prices starting from £59,510. Even pre-facelift, the RS3 was not known for its subtlety, but Audi has seen fit to add further aggression to the way its hyper-hatch looks. Its single-frame grille is now larger and wider (naturally) with a new pattern, while additional side vents are said to be reminiscent of Audi’s legendary Quattro S1 Pikes Peak car from 1987, according to Ingolstadt. Its fancy configurable ‘chequered flag’ LED lights remain, while around the rear there’s a new diffuser with new exhaust surrounds that successfully make the pipes look bigger and a new piece of red trim that looks like it’s been borrowed from the back of an F1 car. There are the usual new wheel designs and colours (Ascari Blue and Matt Daytona Grey), but don’t worry – the RS3’s trademark fluorescent green is still available. Audi clearly knows its audience with the RS3, as one of the new features for 2024 are some delightful carbon-backed front sports seats. There’s a new squared-off steering wheel, similar to the one from the , albeit with more Alcantara on it, of course. New ‘planar lighting’ back-lights – we quote – ‘hundreds of lasered rhombus shapes of various shapes and sizes’ when the car is locked and unlocked, too. For right or wrong, Audi never ceases to amaze with what its LED lights can do. It would have been so easy for Audi to drop the RS3’s cylinder count to four, but thankfully the magical rarity of a five-cylinder engine remains. It’s one thing Audi has left almost untouched, with the RS3’s 2.5-litre unit still putting out 395bhp and 500Nm of torque. Accelerating to 62mph takes just 3.8 seconds and the max speed is 155mph (or 174bhp on the Carbon Vorsprung trim). Audi promises the RS3’s ‘unique sound’ remains courtesy of its firing sequence, with the twin RS big oval exhaust pipes remaining. One of the RS3’s crowning pieces of technology is its ‘Torque Splitter’, which allows 100 per cent of rear torque to the outside wheel alone, making it easy to drift. Again, know your audience. Audi has tweaked this feature further with a new algorithm that is said to respond more sensitively, with the result being higher cornering speeds and the ability to get on the throttle earlier out of a corner – a contributor in it achieving the Nurburgring lap record. It’s also now easier to get sideways courtesy of what Audi calls ‘evolved oversteer’, enabling a driver to get to a drift angle faster. The new Audi RS3 will go on sale in September priced from £59,510, with the Saloon version commanding an extra £1000 across the line-up. Standard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, Nappa leather sports seats, a head-up display and Sonos sound system. Up next is the Carbon Black trim, which brings upgraded alloys, Matrix LED headlights and a full carbon package – priced from £64,160. At the top of the range is the Carbon Vorsprung model, which gets a raised top speed, panoramic roof and adaptive suspension for a £68,650 starting price. The RS3 shaved five seconds off the previous compact car record holder – the – with a fairly scorching 7min 33.1sec, beating the M2’s 7min 38.7sec pretty convincingly. You can watch the lap below. Long-time Audi Sport racing and development driver Frank Stippler was at the wheel who said ‘optimised cornering behaviour’ was the key to the dramatic improvement. Over to Frank: ‘The new RS3 turns in more willingly at corner entry thanks to fine-tuning – including brake torque vectoring – which allows the vehicle to be positioned earlier and better for corner exit from the apex, at the latest.’ He continued: ‘The result is a lower steering angle from apex to corner exit, which leads to less friction and earlier acceleration, allowing you to carry more momentum and speed onto each subsequent straight.’ Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
520,Eccentrica V12: the restomod mission to make a lairy Lambo Diablo easier to drive,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/eccentrica/v12/,Jake Groves,2024-08-20,Car Magazine UK,"This is a Lamborghini Diablo, but not as we know it. This is a fully restored, 21 century version from Eccentrica, and it’s designed to make what was once a rather prickly 90s supercar a little easier to get on with for a new generation. As well as founder Emanuel Columbini (who just so happens to be San Marino’s Chamber of Commerce president), former Lamborghini chief technical officer Maurizio Reggiani is among the team. We’ve been up close and personal with the ‘new’ Diablo during 2024’s Monterey Car Week. ‘The idea was from a Lamborghini car collector,’ Andrea Colombo, Eccentrica co-founder, tells us. ‘And, basically, the idea is to improve the driveability and the handling, as well as the progressivity of the engine and basically make the Diablo more driveable on an everyday basis. The car is already a beast – we wanted to try and find a way to manage it.’ The Eccentrica Diablo, then, is described as a ‘modern interpretation’ of one of Lamborghini’s most recognisable models. Happily, the Diablo’s bodywork has only been lightly updated and tweaked with modern wheel designs, tasty up-close design details. The recogniseable, drop-down headlight covers remain, and Eccentrica’s intricate housing for its new exhaust system and patterned rear deck add a bit of visual flair not seen on the original. Inside, it’s like stepping into a retro-futurism dream. The Diablo’s original interior design structure remains, but with achingly cool retro dials and high-grade materials used. The seats have been widened and made more adjustable for taller drivers, too. Beneath the bodywork is an uprated, but still naturally-aspirated V12. Here, it’s the original 5.7-litre engine from the earlier generation Diablo, but it’s been modernised. ‘We have new camshafts, electronic throttle bodies that the original didn’t have, a new flywheel and exhaust system,’ says Colombo. ‘We didn’t focus too much on adding too much more power.’ So much so that there’s only around 55bhp more. Given the focus on usability, the structure and characteristics of the Diablo have been upgraded. Power steering has been added, and new Brembo brakes remove a weak point of the original; ‘the first generation brakes simply didn’t work at all,’ says Colombo. Double wishbone suspension with semi-adjustable dampers are included, and a new six-speed manual transmission replaces the original’s five-speed. The H-pattern remains, with all six notches kept for each of the new forward gears; revers is now activated electronically. Plus, a nose-lift system is included. Just 19 Eccentrica V12s will be made, using original Diablo models as a base. The first ones will be delivered in 2025. ‘After that we’ll keep on making variants on the chassis, and maybe one with a V8,’ says Colombo.

521,Ford Nugget Camper Van plugs in – the Transit you can sleep and shower in,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/nugget-camper-van/,Tom Webster,2024-08-23,Car Magazine UK,"The Ford Nugget Camper Van is the version of the all-new that comes with two beds, a kitchen and even a shower built in. It’s available to order now and Ford is in the process of adding more versions to the offering. This includes a plug-in hybrid model and an all-wheel drive version. Ford clearly has campers in mind who fancy heading for a pitch that is a bit more off the beaten track, as there is also an Active version that features some more rugged styling and a bit more protection inside and out. The new versions don’t finish there, though, as Ford has also added a long-wheelbase model to the catalogue. This provides a bit more space and storage on the inside and can even come with a built-in toilet. Ford has plans for yet more, though, with an electric version on the cards for the future. The 2024 additions all add to the Nugget range, by bringing something different to ponder. The Active trim is the one that offers more kit, both inside and out. The more obvious changes are outside, where you get what is described as ‘SUV-inspired styling,’ which feels like a bit of a stretch for a van-based campervan. What this means is black plastic panels and cladding, bespoke 17-inch alloy wheels and an Active grille. re are a couple of tweaks on the inside, with the water-resistant seat covers the element that will appeal most, particularly to those with, er, active hobbies that could bring more water and muck into the cabin. The Active, like the Titanium model, can also be equipped with the new all-wheel drive system, although only on the 168bhp 2.0-litre diesel engine with the eight-speed automatic gearbox. This new version of the Nugget Camper Van was first revealed at the Dusseldorf Caravan Salon in August 2023 and these new versions are set to appear at the 2024 equivalent. The other notable change under the bonnet is the addition of the plug-in hybrid powertrain. Like the Ford Transit Custom on which the Nugget is based, this is the same 2.5-litre petrol engine, 11.8kWh battery and motor combination as you find in the Ford Kuga SUV. This means it produces 230bhp, but Ford hasn’t yet said how much electric range it will offer. As a guide, the van promises up to 35 miles, so something just shy of that is likely. The other addition is the long-wheelbase version, which can be specified on the Titanium and Active models and with any of the available engines. This provides more than just extra space inside, with Ford promising a bigger kitchen area with more worktop and storage room, providing spots for your pots and pans. There is also extra storage space in the living area in the form of a bigger wardrobe. If you would rather alternative facilities then you can specify a different layout entirely, featuring a built-in toilet. The Nugget in all its new forms is already available to order. Even though we had to wait years for the first Nugget to arrive in the UK – it was available for more than three decades in Germany before it went on sale here in 2019 – this new one is set to start hitting UK roads by the end of 2024. It won’t be until then that we get precise UK pricing for all the new versions, though. Ford will still let you put your name down for one, though, which is nice of them. Ford is not shying away from the fact that this is a direct rival to the , and it reckons that the medium-camper market is a big enough one for the two models to compete. It’s worth noting that the Nugget and the Cali are two totally different vehicles, even though the Ford Transit Custom and the next VW Transporter will be basically the same van. VW has decided to move its own camper onto the same platform as the Multivan people carrier, while this is the camper version of the new Transit Custom. Unlike the VW, which is an in-house creation, the Ford has been designed with a third-party partner – Westfalia. It’s a long-standing relationship, though – the same company created the previous verions. In a way, it is, but the new Transit Custom looks set to be a much posher and more flexible starting point than the old one. For a start, the totally flat floor in the van means that you can walk around the Nugget’s cabin in a way you never could before. This means you can spin the front seats around, stash more stuff on the floor and generally make better use of the space. That floor is coated in an oak-effect covering, while the seats are lighter and more flexible too. The second row is able to take three seated passengers but it then drops down to create a double bed. Because the seats are heated, so is your bed, which is a lovely sounding touch. The Nugget adopts the same basic layout as its predecessor, which means that the cabin is split into three – front seats, sleeping and kitchen. The kitchen area has been redesigned too, with a drawer-style fridge, a table and chair set stashed in the tailgate and a ladder hidden in a cupboard to get you up to the roof bed. As a result of the tweaks, you get 20% more worktop space and the ability to store a bottle upright in the fridge. The roof has been worked over too, with the side material now better designed for folding. You can also add a solar panel onto the roof top for the first time. In favourable weather, said panel will power all the internal features without the need for plugging in to charge the leisure battery. Those features include the usual interior lighting and heating controls, all of which can be turned on and off via a seven-inch colour touchscreen. But you won’t have to scramble up the ladder in the dark after you’ve turned the lights off – you can pair your phone to the Nugget and control everything via an app. The touchscreen also features an inclinometer, which will help with levelling out on an uneven pitch. It won’t actually adjust the suspension, but it will act like a built-in spirit level to Other neat additions include blackout roller blinds on the windows, charging sockets down by the main bed, a 5G modem to create a WiFi hotspot and a shower in the rear tailgate, now with hot water as standard. If you want privacy while showering then that’s extra, though – you can get a little screen to put around yourself as an option. As with plenty of vehicle launches these days, there are not major surprises in the Nugget Camper Van’s engine range – there are no new units and everything will be shared with the Transit Custom. This means it will launch with a 168bhp 2.0-litre diesel engine. What is new is the plan to offer a PHEV and an all-electric version for the first time – these will both join the range in the first 12 months of the Nugget’s life. The plug-in hybrid will come with the same powertrain that is due to go into the Transit Custom with a 2.5-litre petrol engine and 11.8kWh battery – it’s the same setup from the Ford Kuga SUV. In the Kuga it produces a 35-mile electric-only range, but we’d wager that might be a challenge for the heavy Nugget. It’ll also get an eight-speed automatic transmission and a range of driver assistance systems –adaptive cruise control, reverse brake assist, park assist and a 360-degree camera system to name a few. The electric version promises other exciting prospects, too. By having a big battery on board, it has the potential to be able to power much more in the way of camping gadgets and appliances. Think the sort of things that you would normally have to be hooked up to a campsite’s power supply to make use of. This means that you should be able to spend more time off grid. The obvious caveat to this is the range, which is currently expected to be just over 200 miles in the E-Transit Custom panel van. The extra weight of the living kit in the Nugget is a factor to consider, but the electric-van-range test does bear a payload in mind when it is calculated, so it might not move by much. The Nugget is on display in Germany, but you can already order one with first deliveries due to start in around the end of 2024. Pricing is set to start around the £75,000 mark and there will be a selection of options to make your camper your own. We’ll bring more information as and when we have it.

522,Storks and torque: up close with the Hispano Suiza Carmen Sagrera,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hispano-suiza/carmen-sagrera/,Jake Groves,2024-08-27,Car Magazine UK,"Remember Hispano Suiza? No? That’s understandable – the brand was known for its super-rare, coachbuilt creations during the first 40-odd years of the 20 century. But, since 2019, Hispano Suiza has been back in the ultra-rare automotive landscape with the Carmen electric hypercar. The Carmen has now seen its third iteration with the Sagrera, following on from the original model in 2019 and then the Carmen Boulogne a year later. We’ve had some one-on-one time with head of design, Francesc Arenas during 2024’s Monterey Car Week, explaining why the Sagrera matters. So the Sagrera is designed to be a more aggressive, almost hardcore model of the Carmen EV. Here, a second-generation version of the brand’s own battery pack has been applied, upping capacity from the 80kWh original to 103kWh – good for a claimed range of up to 300 miles. The Sagrera uses axial flux electric motors – one on each corner for a total of 1100bhp and 856lb ft of torque, good for a possible 2.6sec 0-62mph sprint time. New suspension made from ‘military-grade’ materials and carbon ceramic brakes are included, too. It’s the looks, right? This thing is wild to look at from every angle. It’s almost art deco in places, echoing the halcyon days of Hispano Suiza’s coachbuilding days. The Sagrera is designed as a more track-ready version of the Carmen, so needs the aerodynamic prowess to handle being on one. ‘We wanted to take care of all the details of this car and really keep the ‘wow’ effect,’ says Arenas. ‘The new rear diffuser lowers the exit angle of the air passing underneath the car,’ says Arenas, with the two-piece rear wing is designed to add significant downforce and is inspired by the wings of a stork. It’s the emblem of Hispano Suiza. ‘The first time we used it as a symbol was in 1919 when we presented the H6 model at the Paris motor show that year,’ says Arenas. ‘The stork was used for a squadron of French fighter planes that used Hispano Suiza engines. After the war, when Hispano Suiza presented the H6, the chief development officer of the company goes to ask the airplane fighter team if they can use the stork emblem o the top of the radiator. They said yes, because they were hugely grateful for the engines Hispano Suiza provided.’ ‘That’s the difficult part for us,’ says Arenas, ‘because we stopped production of cars… seventy, eighty years ago. To recover this connection with the car enthusiast after so long is a hard challenge. ‘We’re taking a very direct reference to the iconic brand, and then apply it to the environment of the modern hypercar. We started to build this heritage line with the Carmen, just to build that link between the past and present, and now we are growing up and developing this image. ‘For the Sagrera, I requested that the company do this and make an aggressive version of the car, because the people around these kinds of cars find these elements so attractive,’ Arenas adds.

523,Ariel E-Nomad Concept: the go-anywhere battery-powered buggy is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ariel/e-nomad-electric/,Tim Pollard,2024-08-27,Car Magazine UK,"The new Ariel E-Nomad concept shows that the bijou Somerset car maker is taking a long view for its range of lightweight sports cars: it’s fusing the go-anywhere thrills of the Nomad sports buggy with the zero-emissions cleanliness of an . Out goes the Ford Ecoboost four-cylinder turbo, as sampled recently in the new 2024 , replaced by an EV powertrain developed especially for this car. There’s a 41kWh battery feeding power to a 210kW rear motor, delivering equivalent to 281bhp and 361lb ft of torque to the back axle for a 0-60mph sprint time identical to the petrol model’s at 3.4 seconds. That’s a big enough battery capacity to give a 150-mile electric car range, according to Ariel, although if you get too busy with the right pedal – as usually happens in Ariels – we suspect that figure will drop substantially… A 20–80% top-up takes 25 minutes on DC fast-charging. Note the more aero bodywork, including – shock horror – such niceties as a roof! If you’re wondering how a tiny specialist like Ariel had the resources to develop an electrified version of the Nomad, remember that it has a rich network of suppliers and collaborators. It’s already been developing the project, which managing director Henry Siebert-Saunders tells CAR is still a live project, although he will not commit to a live timeline. The company teamed up with Rockfort Engineering and Bamd Composites to develop the E-Nomad, with support and grants from the Department of Trade and the Advanced Propulsion Centre. Rockfort developed the 450-volt battery pack for Ariel, which is claimed to weigh less than 300kg. It uses a new type of lithium-ion modules dubbed Pegasus V3. The battery packs are cooled by a front-mounted radiator, designed to keep the cells cool even when being given a tough work-out on road or off. Ariel director and founder Simon Saunders said: ‘While the E-Nomad is a concept, it does show production intent for the vehicle and hints at just a small part of Ariel’s future. Once it has been through our usual, gruelling testing regime we could opt to add E-Nomad alongside its ICE Nomad 2 sibling, so we’ll take great interest in customer feedback on the concept car.’ Note also the new bodywork made using natural flax fibres, developed by Bamd Composites. The bio-composite natural material is claimed to save 73% of CO2 in manufacturing compared to traditional carbonfibre – and it’s 9% lighter, too. The bodywork is designed to be more aerodynamically efficient. These lighter body panels help keep the weight of the battery-powered Nomad to 896kg. That’s still pretty light, despite adding 181 kilos to the kerbweight of the petrol-powered model. The Arield E-Nomad will be unveiled at the Cenex Expo 2024 on 4 September at the Millbrook proving ground in Bedfordshire.

524,"All change at Polestar: founder Thomas Ingenlath is out, Opel veteran Michael Lohscheller is in",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/polestar/ceo-michael-lohscheller/,Tim Pollard,2024-08-28,Car Magazine UK,"The CEO and founder of Polestar has quit unexpectedly after seven years in charge, marking a major shift in the leadership of the Swedish electric car specialist. He will be replaced on 1 October 2024 by Michael Lohscheller, an industry veteran and former leader of Vauxhall/Opel and Vinfast. Ingenlath was previously design chief at Volvo Cars and took the unusual step of adopting the chief executive role of Polestar, a brand which was resolutely design-led from its inception as it launched in 2017 as Europe’s answer to Tesla with the popular . The change in leadership reflects how Polestar is now entering a scale-up chapter, as it attempts to roll out a whole range of EVs to expand its footprint with the , and all waiting in the wings. Lohscheller isn’t the only new arrival on the executive board announced today: there is also a new chairman, Winfried Vahland who was previously the CEO of Skoda. Lohscheller started in finance positions at Mitsubishi and Volkswagen and has worked in Europe and the United States. After eight years at VW, he joined Opel in 2012 as chief financial officer, before rising through the ranks to become CEO in 2017. After four years steering Opel through change and Covid, Lohscheller had a short stint leading in Vietnam before jumping ship to Nikola in Phoenix, US. Polestar is therefore the fourth global car maker he’s led as CEO in just four years and shareholders must be hoping this is one role he holds down for longer to make an impact. ‘I am honored to join Polestar at such an exciting time in the company’s history,’ he said. ‘Polestar has already established itself as one of the most desirable and innovative brands in the space, and I look forward to working with the talented team to build on this strong foundation and accelerate our development.’ Lohscheller is a hardcore numbers man and industry watchers are already reflecting that this is exactly the kind of leadership Polestar needs right now, as the company seeks to expand its range and grow sales from the modest 55,000 units delivered in 2023. Ingenlath was a creative who birthed Polestar and established a strong identity – in its cars’ design impact, but also the corporate identity and details such as the Polestar typeface which is rigorously applied across every touchpoint of the brand. However, Polestar has endured a turbulent year since it was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US. Its shares have slumped, amid the global slowdown in EV take-up and parent company Volvo revealed in February 2024 that it intended to stop funding Polestar, forcing the spin-off business to stand on its own two feet. ‘I am very proud of what we’ve achieved together in the last seven years,’ said Ingenlath. ‘We had the vision of an electric premium brand which puts performance and design at its core. And we made it, the dream became reality: Polestar is the only true global premium electric brand, we just launched the Polestar 3 and 4, we are producing on two continents – thank you to everybody who contributed so far on this journey, it was a lifetime experience to build up this brand with you all. I wish Michael and the team the best for the next chapter of Polestar.’ Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

525,MG’s £22k hybrid ZS SUV has arrived,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mg/zs/,Jake Groves,2024-08-28,Car Magazine UK,"MG has announced its latest ZS crossover SUV, which will arrive in the UK in October 2024. As well as a refreshed look that brings a bit more design cohesion with the rest of the MG range (including ), the new ZS launches with a powertrain the brand is calling Hybrid+. Hybrid+ consists of a 101bhp 1.5-litre engine and a 134bhp electric motor, combining for a total system output of 193bhp and good for a 0-62mph sprint in 8.7 seconds. MG claims a 55.4mpg fuel economy figure, and emissions of 115g/km. This is currently the only new version of the ZS announced so far, likely with a refresh of the coming later. MG says there are two specifications of ZS: SE and Trophy. Both feature MG Pilot – a fancy name for the car’s suite of safety and driver assistance systems that includes adaptive cruise, lane keeping and departure system, blind spot and cross-traffic alerts and the like. Both also have LED headlights, a large 12.3-inch infotainment display inside and digital instruments for the driver, keyless entry and more. Trophy benefits from ‘leather-style’ upholstery, heated seats and steering wheel, electric driver’s seat and 360-degree camera system. The new ZS is priced from £21,995 for SE spec, with Trophy models coming in at £24,495. The first ones will arrive in dealers in October 2024.

526,PureSpeed hits the road: AMG's latest monster nears production,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/concept-mercedes-amg-purespeed/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-08-28,Car Magazine UK,"The Mercedes-AMG PureSpeed is inching closer to production. Mercedes has just released fresh pictures of the supercar as it undergoes the final stages of testing – and it looks just as striking in camouflage. Originally revealed in May 2024 at the Monaco GP, the new car is the first of Mercedes’ Mythos range – a ultra-limited series of cars designed to increase profits whilst also acting as a new generation of halo products. To that end, only 250 of them will be made. Revealed by Mercedes officially, the new pictures show a handful of PureSpeed prototypes on a test program that includes roads in northern Italy as well as the Nardò test track. As you’d expect engineers are checking a variety of vehicle systems and will also be making finer tweaks to the PureSpeed’s dynamics. The final stages of the testing program will rack up around 3000km or 1864 miles and is a joint project with Pininfarina. Just occasionally a major mainstream car manufacturer loses its head a little. Here’s Mercedes providing a textbook example – this is the AMG PureSpeed concept, and it’s a with its head cut off. Previewing the first model in a what Mercedes is calling a ‘Mythos series’ of limited run vehicles, the PureSpeed has been unveiled ahead of the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix. Which is appropriate not only because Mercedes’ Formula 1 drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell were on hand to lend a little extra glamour but also because the PureSpeed has an . Yeah, we’re getting heavy vibes here – the last time Mercedes went ahead and built a totally roofless production vehicle (and we got to drive it). Funnily enough, Mercedes doesn’t mention this in the official info, instead preferring to reference the OMG-is-it-on-sale-yet , which it says influenced the front-end design and some of the details. Stirling Moss does get a look in, however, alongside Denis Jenkins, as the flying buttresses behind the passenger compartment are supposed to be reminiscent of the 1955 Mille Miglia winning 300 SLR. And if you’re worried about getting a bug in the face at 150mph, don’t. The PureSpeed comes with a pair of specially made ‘aerodynamically optimised’ crash helmets. Ah, this is pretty interesting, too. It’s red and has a number 10 on the side in reference to another road race winner – this time the Mercedes 2-litre that Christian Werner drove to victory in the 1924 Targa Florio. It’s probably no coincidence that was 100 years ago this year. The original was painted red at a time when Mercedes racing cars were usually white. This was so it would blend in with the competing Italian entrants and therefore ‘deter the local fans from impeding the car’s progress.’ Nothing official, but being based on a Mercedes SL suggests 805bhp or more should be available. Which should also enable a top speed in the region of 200mph and 0-62mph in under 3.0 seconds. It’s a new ultra-luxury sub-brand that will create cars that will only be offered to ‘the most dedicated Mercedes-Benz enthusiasts and collectors’. These will be the ‘pinnacle of exclusivity’, apparently, though in the case of the production version of the PureSpeed there will be 250 examples for potential buyers to fight over.

527,"A Detour to luxury: inside Arcane Works, the new bespoke arm of Ineos",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_ineos/grenadier-detour/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-08-28,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Detour, the beginning of an entirely new chapter for Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s fledgling off-road brand. The debut vehicle from Ineos’ bespoke Arcane Works division, it represents a new level of luxury and customisation over the standard car – and it’ll be the first of many. To find out more about the new Detour, and where the new luxury sub brand is headed, we looked around one of the first examples – and spoke to Amerpal Singh, Special Vehicles Operations Manager at INEOS Automotive. The Detour’s mission statement is simple: it’s a Grenadier that you’ll want to extend your journeys in: ‘It needs to be something that you want to take on that longer route home,’ explains ex-JLR man Singh, one of the people tasked with carving a niche for Arcane Works. ‘So it’s enhancing the level of finish and materials and comfort over the base vehicle,’ he continues. ‘We’ve really tried to fit that brief.’ Look around the car and you’ll soon see the differences: At the front there’s an entirely new grille, along with headlamp surrounds and flecks of silver here and there – all giving the Detour a slightly different look.  The headlamp covers look particularly good, though they’re not going to be available for all markets: ‘In the U.S. and Canada, the regulations basically say you can’t cover the headlamps at all,’ explains Singh. ‘So they will be off road only for those markets, but for in UK, Middle East, it will come out like this.’ In addition to the bigger stuff, the front of the Detour also features the first Arcane Works branding – just below the windscreen on the drivers’ side. Like everything else on the car, the badge is bespoke with a focus on UK manufacturing: it’s copper, hand-enamelled and made by the Birmingham-based Vaughtons, firm. There’s a Detour badge around the other side. ‘In every vehicle you’ll have that badge,’ says Singh. ‘We’ve chosen “Arcane” because of the meaning being secret,’ he says. ‘There are just 200 globally so it’ll be very rare to see another one. This will become our flagbearer, effectively.’ Other additions include new 18-inch wheels (compatible with the same tyres as the standard car), clear lights, and extended mud flaps. There are an additional four colours exclusive to the Detour: Magma Red, Storm Force Silver, Whiteout Blue and Squall Green – and there arefurther combinations for the roof rails. More discerning customers can have paint matched to other cars in their fleet, though. The Detour also gets a bespoke exhaust system: ‘We wanted to enhance all that legendary B58 engine that we’ve got under the bonnet,’ Singh tells us. ‘We’ve tried to enhance the bass notes, and we’ve designed it in a way that it doesn’t affect the departure angle.’ The Grenadier retains its utilitarian, Boeing 747-meets-Defender interior, though here you’ll find the same level of elevated craftsmanship as outside. There’s more leather here (provided by Bridge of Weir), machined metal on the main touchpoints, and the floor maps and carpets have also been upgraded. Reach above for the aircraft-style controls, and you’ll find them surrounded by lambswool. Almost certainly. ‘We build the base vehicle in Hambach and then every single one is taken over to Multimatic in Coventry,’ Singh tells us, as we’re looking around the car. Motorsport fans will know the Multimatic name; it’s also responsible for the Mustang GTD, Porsche 963 chassis, the dampers on the Ferrari Purosangue and much more. How’s that for a CV? ‘Certain things like scuff plates, the seat embroidery, you can have a full paint sample…. It takes a lot more hand manual labour to create something special as this.’ It makes sense for Ineos to move into a new luxurious arena; but Singh is adamant that the Detour and future Arcane Works cars won’t trade their off-road capability for luxury. ‘We’re very much wanting to stay the best-in-class 4×4 vehicle out there,’ Singh tells us when asked about the slippery slope to luxury. ‘We made it clear from the start that it’s got to achieve those same foundations that we laid a year and half ago when we launched the base vehicle to customers.’ It’s something you can see around the car, too: while there’s an increased level of fit and finish, there’s no paint where there wasn’t paint before – so the Detour can still be used for more intensive jobs such as going through the brambles, or giving other cars a tow or nudge. It’s the same story inside. ‘It’s going to have the five-year warranty,’ Singh reminds us. ‘It’s going to be tested and signed off exactly the same manner.’ The Detour should be interesting to prospective customers and existing Ineos owners: Singh tells us that many customers communities have already begun to personalise their Grenadiers, with many watching some of the additional bits and pieces on the Detour with interest. And they may well be in luck: the Detour will be a test bed for many additional trinkets, some that could soon become available for the standard Grenadier: ‘Potentially in the future we would love to sell [some parts] as a higher volume aspect, but you wouldn’t get them as complete package.’ It’s clear that the Detour is just the beginning of the Arcane Works story, with several cars already planned. So what’s next? Everything, and in all directions, it seems. ‘We want we want to start, let’s say, pushing certain aspects of the vehicle and having an arm of the business where we can do much more hand modifications.’ Singh reveals. ‘We’ll start to push certain aspects off the vehicle, which may then start filtering down into the normal Grenadier: we may start playing around with things like the chassis, things like the powertrain, things like the electrical systems.’ Actually yes. The Detour has received lots of interest from new and existing customers, with many prospective Detour buyers most impressed with its high level of customisation compared to its competitors. However, there are still slots available: ‘We’ve got a number of orders at the moment, but because every single one is unique, it’s just taking us a bit of time to get through them,’ Singh admits. ‘They’re not all spoken for yet.’ If you do join the Ineos owners’ club – and especially the Arcane Works club – expect to play an ever more important rule in the brand moving forward. Singh is clear that the Ineos owners will continue to be a test bed or sounding board for further Arcane Works editions. ‘We’re on that that journey of getting especially with our keen works, getting close to those customers,’ Singh tells us. ‘They will be the ones who get informed first of what’s coming – that sort of thing.’ We’ll update this page when we know more.

528,Omoda launches in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/omoda/uk-launch/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-08-30,Car Magazine UK,"Omoda has officially launched in the UK. The Chinese brand marked the occasion with an event in London last night and revealed details about the cars it’ll be selling first: the ICE-powered and Omoda E5. As you’d expect, both are mid-sized SUV, crossover-shaped things. Omoda is already in more than 40 markets globally but is aiming for that number to rise to over 60 in the next three years. ‘This is a landmark week for Omoda, as it marks the official start of our journey in a key market for the brand. Omoda is at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and new energy technology products and is already making an impact across Europe, even outselling established brands in some markets, said Chen Chun Qing, executive vice president of Omoda’s parent company Chery International. ‘We are building a futuristic brand for customers, with highly specified, premium models available at a competitive price.’ Omoda’s suits also outlined how it’ll sell those cars and support the customers that buy them. Keep reading to find out more. Take a look at the cars in the pictures, and futuristic isn’t the first word that comes to mind – but Chery’s executive vice president has a point on price: The Omoda range currently kicks off at just £25,235 for the most basic Omoda 5, though that increases to £33,055 for the electric model. In PCP terms, you can get into an Omoda now with a £6400 deposit and repayments of £300 a month. That means Omoda isn’t just targeting the prospective Kia Sportage or owners – it’s also targeting those usually hunting in the second-hand market. ‘We’re at a price point where actually we’re not that far off some used car purchases, but you get a brand new car, you’ve got that confidence of the warranty, you’ve got that confidence of the breakdown cover for it,’ said Omoda’s UK product manager Oliver Lowe. ‘It’s something new and fresh, it’s yours for the first time.’ Lowe also believes that the brand will attract customers who are unable to stick to their usual brands after the Covid price hike: ‘They might be really loyal on one particular brand but can’t afford the car they wanted, and we’re offering them a car that’s priced at the segment beneath,’ he explains. ‘People that may have bought a Qashqai or another SUV and can’t afford the replacement and maybe need to downsize – they’ve got that opportunity to stay in the same size of car with a fantastic specification and great power.’ The first shipment of Omoda cars rolled into the Southampton docks, but Omoda already has a 60-strong UK dealership network in place. ‘We’ve got some excellent dealer partners,’ Lowe tells us.  ‘We talk to them about the previous customers from different brands that they’ve dealt with. I’m really interested in their mix of experience and how we can leverage their experience to talk to people’ ‘It gives us great coverage. A lot of new entrants don’t do that when they join. There’s still huge proportion of customers that are looking for that dealer experience.’ The dealerships are supported by a seven year warranty, and parts network fulfilled by DHL. ‘We’ve got a DHL hub in the middle of the country,’ Lowe adds. ‘We’ve got good parts stock in there, so we’ll be able to react like people are used to from their traditional experience.’ Omoda is expecting the ICE car to sell more due to the low price-point, but it’ll need to do work to ensure it hits the ZEV mandate: ‘I would propose that we will sell 22% EVs because, that’s the mandate target,’ Lowe says – but he added that there are already ideas and measures in place to hit it. ‘We are coming up with new plans, new ideas, ways to meet that we’re still working on,’ he said. One of those will be investing in fleet – but he admitted that it’s still going to be difficult. ‘If you’ve been in the UK a while and you’ve already got some , you know, you can do some work to balance things. If you’re a new brand, it’s a tricky job.’ One thing’s for sure, Omoda won’t be throttling supply to meet the mandate: ‘We’re trying to grow,’ Lowe clarified. ‘To start limiting supply of certain drivetrains, I think it’s really would be a really negative message, not only for our dealers, but for customers as well.’ Omoda will release at least two models next year. First there’ll be the larger, Range Rover Sport or Porsche Cayenne-sized Omoda 9, and then the 3 – a small crossover that’ll rival the Ford Puma and Vauxhall Mokka. Beyond that there’ll the 7 which was previously described as ‘Tucson or Sportage-size’ by UK director, Victor Zhang. ‘We will probably do two to three launches next year,’ confirmed Lowe.

529,Looking backwards to move forwards: new ICE-powered Audi Q5 launched,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/q5/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-09-01,Car Magazine UK,"The Q5 has been a real success story for Audi. Not only is it one of the company’s biggest money spinners, the brand tells us it’s also been one of the most popular mid-size SUVs in Europe since the first-generation model was launched 15 years ago. So, this all-new, third-generation Audi Q5 has quite a lot riding on its shoulders. But Audi is confident the new Q5 can fill the old one’s boots, not least because of how much money it’s thrown at its development. The SUV is built on the company’s brand-spanking new Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) architecture, plus it’s fitted with an all-new infotainment suite and powered by a fresh range of petrol and diesel engines. That latter decision seems rather bold when you consider how large the is looming. But Audi has looked at the and realigned it product plan. Now, it’s hedging its bets that petrol and diesel engines will still be relevant well into the 2030s – and it’s hoping this new Q5 will be the car to satisfy the demand. Like the Audi A5, the new Q5 features Audi’s clever 48-volt MHEV Plus technology. I’ve covered how the system works in exacting detail in this – but I’ll give you a brief overview here. The combustion engines are supported by a 1.76kWh battery pack (which is about twice the size of a normal mild hybrid car’s) and two electric motors. There’s one mounted to the engine amongst the ancillaries and one lashed to the rear of the gearbox. The second motor is beefy enough to power the car on its own at speeds of up to 18mph – and it can also keep the car ticking along once it’s reached motorway speeds. The upshot of the tech is that Audi’s new combustion cars use less fuel and produce fewer CO2 emissions than their predecessors without paying a packaging penalty. The Q5’s new petrol engines are interesting, too. There are three options to choose from – two petrols and one diesel. The cheapest petrol is a rather humdrum 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit with 201bhp and 251lb ft of torque. It sends drive to the front wheel as standard, although buyers can option Audi’s quattro all-wheel drive system. The engine above it is more exciting. It’s a 3.0-litre V6 with 362bhp and 406lb ft of torque – and the upsizing goes to show just how efficient Audi’s new MHEV Plus system is. It’ll be fitted exclusively to the sporty SQ5 model which, naturally, will also come with extras such as quattro all-wheel drive and adaptive air suspension. But it’s the diesel that’s perhaps the most surprising engine of the lot. Most car makers have ditched diesel power in favour of heavily electrified petrol engines – but Audi recognises there as still plenty of long-distance drivers who need the sort of fuel economy that only a diesel can deliver. The engine it chose is an improved version of the Volkswagen Group’s familiar EA288 unit, which is fitted to everything from the to the . It has 201bhp and 295 lb ft of torque and, in the Q5, it’s only available with all-wheel drive. In 2025, Audi will also launch two plug-in hybrid versions of the Q5. They’ll use the same 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine as the base model as their starting point, onto which they’ll add a larger 20kWh+ battery pack and more powerful electric motors. There’ll be two outputs available – 295bhp or 335bhp – and both will be able to cover more than 62 miles on electric power alone. Plus, because the battery is packaged into a cavity under the boot floor, buyers won’t pay a huge penalty in storage space by opting for the PHEV. Unlike any Audi other we’ve yet seen. The infotainment system is the most obvious change. There’s an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster ahead of the driver and a 14.5-inch infotainment screen in the centre of the dash, both mounted under one huge slab of curved glass. I’ve used the new setup in the studio and it’s far quicker than the old Q5’s system. The processors are far more powerful, which means it can chop between screens far more quickly. It’s a shame that we’ve lost the old car’s physical climate controls, but at least Audi had the common sense to give the screen a fixed climate hot bar at its base. My only criticism is that the menu design already looks a little dated. If you’ve got money to burn, you can also have the Q5 with an extra screen for the front passenger. This can be used to assist the driver (by sending nav instructions and media to the central screen) or to simply entertain the front passenger (with video streaming apps such as YouTube). Plus, because the screen has a polarising filter on it, whoever’s lucky enough to be riding shotgun can use it while the car is moving without fear of distracting the driver. The Q5’s cabin is quite flexible, too. The rear bench can be slid forwards and backwards to either increase boot capacity or improve rear legroom. There’s even a storage slot for the parcel shelf under the boot floor. That means, you won’t need to leave it at home when you’re carrying loads of luggage. You also get four USB-C ports in total – and you can pay extra to make those in the rear powerful enough to recharge a laptop. Plus, there’s are plenty of storage bins, including a sunglasses tray, a bigger central storage bin and a wireless smartphone charging pad in the centre console. Quite a bit. The brand dedicated a lot of energy to making the Q5 cut through the air cleanly, as that improves both fuel economy and refinement. The firm has designed aero panels for its underside, wheels and wheelarches which help to direct air away from the most turbulent parts of the car and cut down on drag. The brand has gone big on lighting, too. It’s daytime running lights and rear lamps are now made up of loads of little OLED pixels, which allow the driver to customise the Q5’s front and rear lighting signatures. There are eight to choose from in total. Audi hasn’t yet confirmed UK prices but, in Europe, the entry-level Q5 petrol will start from €52,300 (around £44,000). The cheapest diesel will set you back €57,100 (roughly £48,000), while the range-topping SQ5 will cost €82,900 (almost £70,000).

530,New Dacia Duster priced from under £19k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/dacia/duster/,Tim Pollard,2024-09-03,Car Magazine UK,"The new is designed not to mess with a winning formula. This has been Europe’s bestselling SUV bought by private retail customers every year since 2018, remember. So Dacia has gone to great pains not to throw the baby SUV out with the bathwater. So the new third-generation Duster looks very like its predecessors, but with a newfound sleekness to the design. Dimensions are almost identical – it’s a little wider and lower, but the same length, for a similar footprint. And it’s still a tough-nut that can walk the walk off-road, as well as talk the talk on it, with some butch styling details in keeping with Dacia’s outdoorsy image. And yet, the brand has aimed to keep the price as low as it can. Entry prices for the new Duster start from under £19k and topping out at below £27k. Read , or find out more below. There’s plenty of cladding on the car, including what Dacia calls the ‘snorkel’ (the protective plastic sheath running up the front door to minimise parking scuffs). It’s made of Starkle, a sustainable new material that’s composed of 20% recycled plastics, part of Renault Group’s continued focus on improving its sustainable multi-use creds. Developed with chemical giant LyondellBasell, the cladding is used on the wheelarches and skid plates and features a fleck that proudly showcases its reused ingredients. In case you were in any doubt, there’s a virtue-signalling recycling logo embossed by the fake cooling duct beneath the door mirror. The original put the Romanians on the map back in 2010, proving that a great-value, no-nonsense SUV with off-roading creds and a utilitarian vibe backed by proven Renault mechanicals would resonate with buyers fed up with ever-more complicated cars. They hit the bullseye with v1 and 2017’s lightly refreshed v2: the Duster cemented its place alongside Sandero as the brand’s biggest seller, notching up 2.2 million registrations in 13 years. Which explains why the design and engineering chefs have been briefed not to mess with the recipe too much. It’s more of the same, but the 2024 debutant plays catch-up with the technological and sustainability agenda to keep up with society’s fast-moving expectations. Key to the upgrade is the adoption of the Renault Group’s CMF-B platform, the oily bits that already underpin Sandero and Jogger. It is an entirely new architecture from Duster 1 and 2, ushering in hybrid powertrains, superior connectivity and compliance with ever tighter GSR2 safety regulations imposed in Europe. You can blame these rules on the proliferation of touchscreens, cameras and tech, additions at odds with the company’s back-to-basics mantra. Headline news is a set of cleaner engines, all of them familiar from elsewhere in the Dacia range. Entry-level models start with the TCe 100 Bi-Fuel, continuing the company’s lone-ranger mission to continue with LPG. Not a big seller in Britain, but popular on the Continent, it packs a regular fuel tank and a 50-litre autogas bunker for an impressive 807-mile combined range without stopping. It’s quite the long-range hero. If LPG’s not your thing, the TCe 130 brings mild hybrid tech to the familiar 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine, for lower emissions (down -10%) thanks to a 48-volt system harvesting energy into a small 0.9kWh battery that’s then fed back to assist acceleration. This is the powertrain that offers two- or all-wheel drive; note that Europe will no longer take the diesel engine (although it continues for African markets). No great shakes, as it accounted for just 5% of UK sales. The range-topping Hybrid 140 powertrain is carried across from Jogger, marrying a 93bhp 1.6-litre four-pot with a 48bhp electric motor fed by a 1.2kWh battery. Dacia claims it’s so efficient that it can drive around town on electric mode up to 80% of the time, reducing average fuel consumption by a fifth. Note that no fuel economy mpg figures or CO2 outputs are available yet. We’ll update this article once the full and final specs are homologated and published. Switching to the CMF-B architecture brings packaging benefits, too. There’s considerably more interior space and the boot floor is lower, while the tailgate opening is wider and taller – meaning the boot capacity grows by 6% to 472 litres under the parcel shelf. CAR has already sat inside the new Duster and can report it’s roomy in both rows with easier access now that the rear door aperture is considerably wider. The upticked rear side window makes you worry about a pinched, sporting SUV roofline, but it’s a trick of the eye; there’s actually plenty of space for limbs and luggage. Dacia is rolling out a series of useful, practical features in the new Duster. The headline act is the clever YouClip modular storage system which places eight mounts around the cabin and boot allowing owners to attach anything from device holders to torches, coat hooks to handbags in the footwell or to the front seatbacks. It’s a patented clip, so don’t go expecting third parties to get in on the act like iPhone accessories. Duster gets YouClip first and it’ll quickly spread across most models in the range – and maybe even back to the Renault mothership, engineers reveal. One feature that may perturb minimalists is the creeping influence of digitisation. Dacia has historically spurned tech for tech’s sake (even banning electric seats in all models to date), but Duster v3 has actively embraced more digital features. A 10.1-inch touchscreen is joined by an electronic parking brake on all but the base model; over-the-air updates refresh the software; and a suite of safety systems will nudge you back into lane and auto-brake in an emergency. Has it gone too far? It’s a tightrope the brand must tread, as customers expect a certain degree of connectivity nowadays and regulations insist on nannying safety features. Reassuringly, the Duster should still hold its head high off road and Dacia claims class-leading ability in the rough stuff ‘unparalleled in the non-expert 4×4 market.’ By which they mean it’s better than anything without a close-ratio transfer ’box. To boost aero efficiency, ground clearance is lower than before, but there’s still 217mm between tarmac and axle to scramble over obstacles and Dacia quotes 31deg/36deg approach/departure angles, while a new 4×4 Terrain Control lets drivers pick from five driving modes, modulating drivetrain and chassis settings to optimise traction in all conditions. UK prices for the new Dacia Duster have been announced, with the range starting from under £19k. An entry-level Essential TCe100 Bi-Fuel costs £18,745. But the ones likely to be bought in bigger numbers jump a little in price. The Expression TCe130 – the next model up, costs £21,245, and the cheapest hybrid Duster will set you back £24,245.

531,Baja-blasting Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT launches in North America,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/ioniq-5-xrt/,Jake Groves,2024-09-04,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has designed a new variant specifically for thoss of us ‘who want to play in the dirt.’ This is the new Ioniq 5 XRT, and it’s a new version that’s launching for the North American market alongside the updated version of Hyundai’s rather good EV. The brand is seemingly following the trend constructed by the likes of the and , for example – but is offering an electric car that’s designed to handle the wilderness rather than some OTT supercar. Hyundai’s engineers and designers have gone to town with the Ioniq 5’s retro looks, taking a hack saw to the bodywork and replacing a lot of it with toughened plastic body cladding (complete with a digital camo design etched into it) that’s designed to be more durable in the rough stuff. XRT versions also benefit from off-road tyres and bespoke 18-inch wheels, as well as lifted suspension (up by 23mm) with bespoke tuning. Inside, the changes are more subtle, with bespoke ‘H-Tex’ seat upholstery (which looks a lot like artificial leather) with XRT branding. Naturally, given the XRT’s off-roading cred, the new version uses a dual-motor E-GMP configuration paired with an 84kWh battery pack. Performance specs aren’t confirmed, with Hyundai targeting a circa-250-mile range when the new models are properly range tested. The XRT model comes as the updated Ioniq 5 launches in North America, including the announcement that the model will come with an NACS charging port that allows access to Tesla’s Supercharger network. And, sadly, the XRT won’t make it beyond North America. Boo! Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

532,"ICE, ICE, baby: Cupra Terramar is a new compact SUV that isn't electric",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/cupra/terramar/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-09-04,Car Magazine UK,"This is your latest look at the Terramar, an all-new ICE-powered from Cupra. Based on the VW Group’s MQB Evo platform, an early example was shown around two years ago at the brand’s Impulse event – but now it’s ready for production. The Cupra Terramar represents the next stage in our growth journey,’ said Wayne Griffiths at the car’s launch in Barcelona. ‘A sporty SUV that will bring the young and challenger mindset of Cupra to a broader audience, expanding the brand and appealing to new customers who are looking for more emotion and performance.’ The Terramar will also benefit from Cupra’s new strategic alliance with the America’s Cup: the car launched during the competition’s 37th edition, and Cupra will make 1337 America’s Cup Terramar models– all with special design touches inside and out. It is not. Cupra wants to reach a larger audience with the Terramar, and that means that unlike the flagship and EVs, the Terramar sticks to old-fashioned combustion. That’ll keep the price down, the range up – and in theory keep the sales up too. At least that’s what Cupra’s hoping. There’s reason for the suits to be confident though. It’s a formula that continues to work well for Cupra even if it’s not totally in keeping with its futuristic, electric image as both the Leon and the Formentor models continue to sell well. Throw in wavering demand for EVs as well as an uncertain geopolitical climate, and Cupra’s decision to add another hybrid to the mix feels like a prescient one. With that in mind, customers will be able to choose from five different powertrain options: there’s an entry-level 1.5-litre 48V mild hybrid with 110kW (148 bhp) and a seven-speed DSG. Next there’s a pair of petrol engines; a 2.0-litre TSI with 150kW (201 bhp) with a seven speed DSG and four-wheel drive – and another with 195kW (262 bhp) for the hotter VZ car. There’s also a pair of eHybrids: a 150kW (201 bhp) 1.5-litre system, and 200kW (268 bhp) system with the same displacement, both of which use a 19.7kWh battery pack. The latter allows for 70 miles of EV-only charge. The Terramar slots neatly in the mid-sized crossover arena, measuring 1584mm tall, 1863mm wide, 4519mm long – and with a wheelbase of 2681mm.  And as you’d expect, every millimetre carries Cupra’s now distinctive styling. You’ll find the same triple-triangle lights as elsewhere on the range, the same flashes of copper, and the same rear-light treatment – complete with Cupra branding too. The main difference between the most recent cars and the Terramar, though, is the addition of a gaping grille to feed the five ICE powertrains above. I’ll run on 18-, 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels, and nine exterior colours are available including two matte options – this is Cupra after all. The Terramar isn’t as adventurous inside as its Tavascan sibling, but Cupra’s designers have done their best to keep things interesting. Front and centre is a 12.9-inch infotainment screen, and the rest of the interior is pretty similar to what you’d find in the Leon. Still, there’s a head up display, the HMI has been improved and there’s also an illuminated touch slider – an improvement over the hard-to-see original in older VW Group cars. Three ‘interior characters’ are available, each with varying amounts of sustainability points. Deep Ocean uses 100% upcycled Seaqual yarn, Moon Light uses 73% – and the High Canyon trim ops for leather that uses a plant-based tanning process. Slightly less sustainable, then. Luggage load isn’t bad either, with a maximum of 602-litres. Aside from the premium feel, the Terramar will need to differentiate itself from the competition with a unique driving experience. To that end, it uses front MacPherson struts and a rear multilink suspension setup which has been lowered 10mm compared to the usual MQB Evo ride height. The steering has been tinkered to improve the feel and reaction of the Terramar, and an electric brake booster aims to improve response and improve the feel of braking during regeneration. Key to the mix, however, is the Terramar’s Dynamic Chassis Control brain and two-valve shock absorbers, which can be put in a range of modes. There’s Comfort, Performance, Individual and Off-road on all models, while the higher-end VZ models gets the hardcore Cupra mode, too. Cupra will let you turn the ESC to Sport on all powertrains, but will let you turn it off altogether on the hotter VZ versions. We’re expecting the Terramar to cost around £40k. It’ll be made in Audi’s Gyor plant in Hungary and deliveries to customers will start in Q1 of 2025.

OK, the changes to the outside aren’t huge (and they’ve partly been carried out to bring the XC90 closer in line with the ) but they’re just enough to stave off any accusations that Volvo’s large SUV is looking long in the tooth. On the outside, there’s a new grille design with slimmer headlights featuring a new iteration of the Thor’s Hammer LED signature, while the bonnet and front wings have also been updated. There’s a new alloy wheel design on offer, a new colour (Mulberry Red) and darkened rear lamps. Storage has been improved thanks to a reconfigured central tunnel design with a 2+1 cupholder that can now take skinny drinks cans. There’s also a better location for the wireless phone charger (forward of the gearlever), a new dashboard design, upgraded ambient lighting and refreshed upholstery options including bio-attributed Nordico and Navy Herringbone Weave. Volvo’s also gone to the trouble of improving the central touchscreen. Now 11.2-inches rather than 9, it’s got a greater pixel density and is more responsive to inputs. Users will also spot a new interface – as seen on the EX90 and – and an upgraded 360-degree camera with split screen. Changes have been made to the suspension setup, meaning you now get double-wishbone hardware at the front and a new integral link system at the rear in order to improve stability and traction while towing. The standard suspension system also now features Frequency Selective Damping (FSD) tech for better ride comfort, while improved sound insulation aims to give a quieter driving experience. As for the engines, the XC90 offers a choice of three. These are the straightforward petrol B5 and B6 AWD variants – delivering 181bhp and 217bhp respectively and a flagship plug-in hybrid T8 AWD with a combined 449bhp and an all-electric range of around 44 miles. Volvo has yet to release a price tag for the updated XC90 yet but expect it to come in at slightly more than the pre-facelift variant that started at just over £52k. Order books are open now with production starting later in 2024. The XC90 will be available with 5,6 and 7 seats and as such rivals include the , , and .

534,BMW teams up with Toyota to build hydrogen production car for 2028,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bmw-toyota-hydrogen/,Jake Groves,2024-09-05,Car Magazine UK,"BMW Group and Toyota Motor Corporation have announced a new partnership regarding hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, confirming the two major car makers will jointly develop the ‘next generation of fuel cell technology.’ On top of that, BMW has announced that as part of the partnership plans, it will launch a fuel cell production vehicle in 2028. Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW AG board, says that the partnership is ‘a milestone in automotive industry,’ adding that BMW’s new vehicle will be ‘the first-ever series production fuel cell vehicle to be offered by a global premium manufacturer.’ Note Zipse’s use of the word ‘premium’ there, aiming to differentiate BMW’s efforts from the likes of the already produced by Toyota or the that was produced by Hyundai. ‘BMW and Toyota share the same passion for cars and belief in ‘technology openness’ and a ‘multi-pathway’ approach to carbon neutrality,’ adds Toyota Motor Corporation president, Koji Sato. ‘Based on these shared values, we will deepen our collaboration.’ The two major car makers have also worked together for a while now, given the jointly developed BMW and . Both brands see themselves as technology agnostic; as well as Toyota’s playing of the field when it comes to powertrain technologies in its production cars, BMW has invested hugely in hybrids and EV and ventured into fuel cell vehicles before. The closest the Munich-based brand has come with fuel cell tech is the iX5 hydrogen fuel cell model ( ), but it was only a small-scale pilot project. The new hydrogen fuel cell powertrain being developed by both brands will then be deployed by both brands in future production vehicles, reducing costs for each brand alone and broadening the economies of scale. As well as BMW’s first production FCEV launching in 2028, Toyota says it will, in tandem, ‘expand the range of FCEV options available to customers, bringing hydrogen mobility one step closer to reality.’ BMW’s first production fuel cell car will, according to the brand, be ‘integrated into BMW’s existing portfolio,’ meaning a fuel cell variant will be added to the powertrain mix of a model that already exists.

535,Updated Genesis G80 Electrified features ‘Chauffeur Mode’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/g80/,Jake Groves,2024-09-06,Car Magazine UK,"Genesis has announced a facelift for its luxury saloon for the Korean market, stretching it and adding some swanky new technology. The look itself hasn’t changed much, with the brand’s double-deck headlights, big mesh-like grille design and sweeping creases still all there. New wheels inspured by those seen on feature as well as a longer wheelbase. That longer wheelbase naturally means more space inside, which has been almost entirely used to increase rear space. The latest Hyundai Motor Group tech makes its way across with new, massive OLED screens and infotainment software, as does a new sound system for the electric powertrain and rear-wheel steering for better manoeuvrability. New ‘Road-Preview Electronic Control Suspension’, which is basically word salad for a suspension system that scans the road ahead for bumps (like a Rolls-Royce) is also included. Most interestingly, though, is the introduction of the ‘Chauffeur Mode.’ The mode is designed to dampen hard acceleration, says Genesis, ‘through the optimisation of suspension and torque settings.’ The same applies to the brakes, too – the mode is designed to soften any stabby brake inputs. Genesis has also given the powertrain itself an update, with the G80 featuring a larger 94.5kWh battery pack (up from 87.2kWh). The brand says that means a possible 295-mile e-range – a figure only presently measured under Korean certification standards. It’s unconfirmed whether the updated G80 will come to Europe, but it seems likely. The car is considered one of the brand’s flagships in the European market (we don’t get the larger G90) as it hopes to increase sales in the region.

536,Picking up fewer vibrations: classic beach buggy goes all-electric,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/meyers-manx/manx-ev-dune-buggy/,CJ Hubbard,2024-09-06,Car Magazine UK,"If the whet your appetite, but just wasn’t beach buggy enough for you, good news: the all-new Meyers Manx 2.0 EV is making its UK and Europe debut at the 2024 . The original dune buggy is getting an all-electric upgrade in time to celebrate its 60th anniversary, and the pre-production version will be on display, fresh from a similar outing at the . Finished in a homage to the original Meyers Manx ‘Old Red’ of 1964 – red paint, white Bimini roof, plus green stripe as a nod to Old Red’s green accessories – it certainly looks the part. But despite appearances, the firm says the Meyers Manx 2.0 is its first totally new vehicle in over 50 years, describing it as ‘a paradigm of performance with style to match.’ That’s a good question. The classic VW Beetle based design has clearly been given a thorough going-over here – in fact, the company’s website boasts of how modern 3D scanning techniques have made it possible to improve the regular combustion versions, which you can still buy, and even build yourself – but actual technical details are pretty scarce. We have asked, and are promised official specifications ‘in the next three weeks’. While we wait, we can report a driving range figure of 125 miles is being touted, while the use of a ‘sealed’ electric drivetrain is expected to improve reliability. With a specific reference to the end of busted oil pans during off-road excursions. The power, performance, battery capacity and – critically – weight are all a bit of a mystery at the moment, though an appearance in the Forza Horizon 5 video game (yes, really – and why not?) suggests a planned 200bhp and 240lb ft, and a target weight of 748kg. This dinky dune buggy might look a little comical by 2024 standards, but it originated with serious off-road intent and has quite the pedigree behind it. Starting in 1964, Bruce Meyers used boat-building techniques to combine a shortened Beetle chassis with a fibreglass form, and the result immediately began to break dune and desert racing records. Road-legal versions followed, but the original B F Meyers & Co firm went under in 1971 – despite a number of celebrity fans, including Steve McQueen and, uh-huhuh, Elvis Presley. The current incarnation, Meyers Manx, Inc, resurrected the original vehicles in 2000, and has now moved on to this 2.0 version with EV power. A prototype of this has recently been tested at Baja, maintaining those off-road links. You can still get a petrol-powered Meyers Manx. And if you’re really into it, there’s even a limited edition available right now with a wacky three-cylinder radial engine in the back. Called the Meyers Manx Tarmac Touring Edition, instead of an air-cooled Beetle or Porsche motor, this uses a 2.0-litre triple from . Australians. Clearly nutters. Originally intended for aviation, despite appearances it uses components from the ubiquitous LS1 V8, and comes in a variety of specifications dependent on the depth of your wallet. No word on exactly how much go the Tarmac Touring Edition possesses, but Meyers Manx does wryly note it ‘delivers over double the power of a classic Volkswagen engine’ – and we bet it sounds pretty, ah, rad while doing it. No kidding about the limited nature either. Just six Tarmac Touring models will be produced by Meyers Manx, though the Radial Motion 3 is supposedly available as an option for other classic buggy builds as well. You’ll need to really want one, however, as the price for the limited edition is $119,500 (around £91,000 right now) and securing an order requires a non-refundable $23,900 (£18k) deposit. Going back to the EV, that’s also a little eyewatering. Although the deposit drops to just $1000 (£760) you’ll eventually need to stump up at least $125,000 in total – that’s £95,000. It’s cool, almost certainly groovy and no doubt fun, fun, fun until daddy takes the charging cable away. But it also makes the £35,995 Moke Electric look like a bargain. Which is an achievement in itself. The 2024 Goodwood Revival includes a rolling display of Meyers Manx vehicles at the start of the opening parade lap each day, including the new 2.0 EV. A new four-seater model called the Meyers Manx Resorter NEV – that’s Neighbourhood Electric Vehicle – is also planned, but this seems to be more of an upmarket club car than anything else, as maximum speed is limited to 25mph… CJ is a former Associate Editor of CAR, and now runs parent company Bauer Media’s Digital Automotive Hub – the in-house team that provides much of the online content for CAR and sister site Parkers.co.uk as well as helping out with CAR magazine.

537,"The Ginetta Akula is a £275,000 British hypercar with racing DNA",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ginetta/akula/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-09-06,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Ginetta Akula – an all-new hypercar commissioned to celebrate two decades of ownership under current owner Dr Lawrence Tomlinson. If it looks familiar, that’s because it was originally revealed in concept form in 2019. Now, however it enters production, with just twenty examples planned. It’ll cost £275,000 plus taxes and shopping – and build slots are still available. It’s fair to say the Ginetta was penned with performance in mind rather than looks. Every part of the car exists due to hours in the wind-tunnel, with much of it derived from the brand’s own G61-LT-P1 LMP1 race car. A flat floor helps with drag, but every inch of the car’s upper surface is adorned with aero tricks: from a front splitter to turning vanes and a huge rear diffuser, it’s all about extracting as much downforce as possible. The Akula uses a lightweight carbonfibre monocoque with carbon front and rear subframes, and a steel roll cage adds to the rigid platform. There’s a front and rear double wishbone pushrod suspension, with electronic dampers for more control over handling. Front and rear anti-roll bars can also be tweaked depending on track conditions. Altogether it weighs just 1190kg, but that hasn’t stopped Ginetta’s engineers adding 360mm steel discs all around. An optional Akula race pack adds carbon ceramic stoppers for extra braking power – and a slight reduction in unsprung mass. Ginetta has plopped the engine in the middle of the chassis for the best compromise between optimum weight distribution and space for aerodynamics. The Akula uses a 6.4-litre naturally-aspirated V8 designed in-house. The block is aluminium, but the valvetrain is titanium, and it’ll throw out 600bhp at 7200rpm and 670Nm of torque at 5100rpm. Power goes through either a six-speed manual, or a seven-speed automatic ‘box, and then to limited-slip differential before going to the rear wheels. Keep it in a straight line, and it’ll hit 0-62mph as soon as 2.9 seconds. ‘Since the Akula concept was unveiled back in 2019, the car has undergone an intensive test and development programme,’ said Clive Seddon, Ginetta’s technical director. ‘We have spared neither time nor expense to fine-hone the Akula to deliver the sharpest and most immersive driving experience possible, and Lawrence has been there with the team every step of the way.’ You won’t be able to get the first, with owner Tomlinson already first on the order book – as you’d expect. ‘But I am looking forward to seeing who will join me in taking ownership of a British-built Ginetta supercar utterly without compromise,’ he added.

538,Bentley’s new Flying Spur launches with mighty 771bhp PHEV power,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bentley/flying-spur/,Jake Groves,2024-09-10,Car Magazine UK,"Bentley has pulled the covers off its new Flying Spur, which now features plug-in hybrid power. The new-generation has underwent very similar changes to , namely the introduction of a load of new technology and the fact it launches with the brand’s ‘Ultra Performance Hybrid’ engineering for its flagship Speed model. Visually, it doesn’t look much different, with almost all of the changes happening under the bodywork. Like the Conti, gone is the W12 engine sitting atop the model range. Instead, the PHEV powertrain features a 548bhp 4.0-litre V8 with new twin single-scroll turbochargers and a single 188bhp electric motor housed within the transmission, with total system output reaching a heady 771bhp. Bentley says the new PHEV powertrain ‘outperforms the W12 Speed on every metric: torque, speed, power, acceleration and emissions.’ So much so that this mighty (and rather heavy) four-door, five-seat express can sprint to 62mph in 3.5 seconds. Bentley says the Flying Spur Speed can remain in electric mode at up to 87mph, is capable of up to 47 miles of e-range and can be charged to full in 2h 45m at an 11kW charge point. Like the Conti GT Speed, the Flying Spur Speed features Bentley’s Performance Active Chassis. That bundles together an electronic limited-slip differential, Bentley’s 48-volt active anti-roll system and rear-wheel steering together. New twin-valve damping allows for separate control of compression and rebound when driving over bumps, allowing for more detailed control of the ride quality. Tech has also been heavily refreshed, with functions controllable by an app and Bentley’s wellness technologies being applied here. The infotainment has taken a big step forward with new connectivity functions, and it can still be hidden by the rotating display. More variants of the new-generation Flying Spur will launch in the months to come. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

539,Citroen SM reimagined… with a DS badge,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ds/citroen-sm-tribute/,Ted Welford,2024-09-11,Car Magazine UK,"is again looking at iconic Citroens as the inspiration for its new cars, with the SM now reimagined as a sleek concept car. Revealed ahead of the Chantilly Arts & Elegance Concours, held just outside Paris, it celebrates 10 years since and previews ‘models that will come along at the end of the decade’, says DS design director Thierry Metroz. Time remembers the SM kindly, and so do DS’s designers who have created the ‘SM Tribute’. Looking nothing like the cars currently in the premium French brand’s line-up, such as the DS3 and (its current flagship), it’s a striking reinterpretation of this classic. It retains the SM’s silhouette, while the famed wheel spats have been retinterpreted as an extension of the bodywork, though are still removeable. The iconic glass-fronted ‘grille’ is back, too, as is the huge rear window. Dimensions are similar in width and height, but it’s considerably wider at just shy of two metres. It’s a bold mix of old and new in the SM Tribute’s interior, with fabulous curved one-piece seats harking back to the original, and trimmed in a similar tobacco colour, though, of course, DS doesn’t describe them that way in 2024. The rest of the ‘new’ SM’s interior is very different, though, with a curved centre console incorporating the thinnest of touchscreens and a yoke-like steering wheel. It’s easy to forget just how innovative Citroen has proven over the years, and the SM is a fine example. Conceived in the late 1960s as a replacement for the flagship DS, it featured a host of innovations that were impressively cutting-edge at the time. Swivelling headlights, electric front seats and rain-sensitive wipers were all advanced, and its Maserati V6 engine and hydraulic self-levelling suspension made it an impressive GT car. Good question. DS has a habit of revealing lots of whacky concepts that never come to fruition, but the SM feels a bit different. There’s clear lineage, and widespread appreciation for this old Citroen, which could do DS plenty of favours. Thierry Metroz, design director of DS, says: ‘We are working on the genes of our iconic models to fuel our research into the shape of future models that will come along at the end of the decade It’s been 10 years since DS Automobiles was established as a standalone brand, though it didn’t help that in its first few years it kept selling rebadged Citroens. The same could be said for Cupra, of course. But unlike that brand, DS has never really come to any real success outside of its home market. Despite its fairly wide range of vehicles, including crossovers, SUVs, saloons and family hatchacks, DS sales remain minimal. In the first eight months of 2024, it sold just 780 cars in the UK. To give you an idea of how small that is, Subaru sold more than twice as many cars in the same period… The DS SM Tribute will be shown at the Chantilly Arts & Elegance Concours d’Elegance on September 15 alongside a wide range of original SMs. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
540,Born again: Cupra reveals new 322bhp hot hatch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/cupra/born-vz/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-21,Car Magazine UK,"Cupra has unleashed a hotter version of its electric Born hatch, and it’s essentially the ID.3 GTI before Volkswagen makes it. Called the Born VZ,(VZ comes from the word Veloz in Spanish meaning speed) it has more power, an improved chassis, interior and suspension to match. The headline figures come from the powertrain: power is now up to 322bhp, 40% over the next best e-Boost variant. Elsewhere, torque is up 75% over the next best Born to 402lb ft. Of course, the elephant is the room is the which still overshadows the best from the Volkswagen group; MG’s beast tips the scales at 429bhp and 443lb ft – and it hits 0-62mph in 3.8 seconds instead of the Born VZ’s 5.7. Perhaps there’s another, even hotter Cupra is the works to compete. Cupra has made some interior and exterior tweaks to single out the new Born from its milder siblings: the Born VZ gets a new stiffer DDC Sports suspension, more direct steering and better braking-feel. To account for the extra power, Cupra has upped the battery capacity 2kWh to 79 kWh, with range now at 335-miles. Range of alloy wheels are available, and bucket seats come as standard now. Inside, the touchscreen has also grown to 12.9-inches, while Cupra will ship the Born VZ with a new 425-watt sound system from Sennheiser. Pricing for the new Born VZ will be revealed in the third quarter of 2024, with UK prices and specs revealed at summer.

541,"Covid, war, cost spikes, rising interest rates, logistics nightmares… so why is Lamborghini still smashing sales records?",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lamborghini/lamborghini-sales-record-2023/,Tim Pollard,2024-01-24,Car Magazine UK,"You’d think that the wealthiest clientele might row back on ostentation as the world wobbled in the wake of the pandemic, wars in Europe and the Middle East, volatile supply chains, rising interest rates and soaring prices. But no. Lamborghini, , set a sales record in 2023, delivering 10,112 cars to customers. To help explain the performance, CAR magazine caught up with CEO and chairman Stephan Winkelmann to find out how the Italian supercar brand bucked economic headwinds in its 60th anniversary year. ‘It has been difficult,’ he admitted. ‘There was so much wealth accumulated throughout Covid, but we’ve also encountered logistics issues, raw material price increases and more. We have faced a lot of pressure. This keeps me awake during sleeping hours sometimes.’ In line with other luxury brands, Lamborghini’s growth in recent years has been fuelled by its move in to the globally popular SUV segment. The , which launched in 2017, sold 6087 units last year, followed by the junior supercar, which shifted 3962 coupes and roadsters (an impressive record for a car in its run-out year). The balance of sales were V12 supercars: the last dozen and 51 ‘few-offs’, Sant’Agata’s terminology for its bespoke range based around the visceral 6.5-litre V12. The biggest markets for Lamborghinis in 2023 were: Winkelmann said the key to selling super-sports cars was forensic balancing of supply and demand in multiple territories. ‘It’s the first time we have delivered 10,000 cars,’ he said. ‘It’s not because we wanted to reach a new peak, but it’s a natural consequence of our solid order bank that lasts all the way to the end of 2025.’ The CEO revealed that the new hybrid range-topper had an even longer waiting list, stretching out to 2026, and said that the company was prepared to cut production of any model line if demand collapsed. ‘We are doing our utmost to keep it under control,’ he added. ‘We are ready to block and switch off production if this is needed at any time. The last thing we need is to jeopardise the brand. ‘We are better prepared now than in the last decade, because of the order bank. It is more solid. We can rely on different regions. Order cancellations can happen from day to day – but it’s not happening, we are constantly monitoring this and it’s under control. We must not hit the iceberg.’ Seems like the world’s wealthiest car buyers are still flocking to Lamborghini’s 184 dealerships in 54 markets around the world. That’s one tactic to hedge the risk: even if Europe might slump, the strategists hope that other parts of the world would boom. Spreading the risk globally, growing the range with a fourth model line (trailed by the all-electric ) and creating an ever-evolving range of spin-offs, from off-road models to modish one-offs, are all ways to keep the plates spinning.

542,New Toyota Sport Crossover concept preview sleek EV for 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/sport-crossover-concept/,Jake Groves,2023-12-03,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s range of electric cars will grow to include a sleek four-door, as previewed by this: the Sport Crossover Concept. The Sport Crossover Concept shows an all-new model that doesn’t really seem to share much of a look with many other Toyota models in its range, with brand executives confirming that it won’t remain a concept. In fact, Toyota Europe’s vice president, Andrea Carlucci, confirmed that a model based on the Sport Crossover concept will launch in 2025. Interestingly, despite having the word ‘crossover’ in the car’s title, there’s barely any SUV-ish-ness (let’s make that a word, shall we?) to the car’s design at all. The roofline is low, the car’s front and rear overhangs are pronounced and the wheelarches almost wrap around the large wheels beneath. It still looks like a futuristic Toyota, too, with the brand’s clean new headlight design (which is also seen on ) sitting pride of place. Carlucci says it himself, the car is ‘much more coupe-ish design or, even better, a sort of fastback.’ ‘We believe the market is not just the SUV,’ says Carlucci. ‘We want to offer the right solutions for any kind of customer – this can be the right solution for the customer who is specifically looking for something that is stylish.’ Toyota plans to introduce six electric cars by 2026 for the European market, with one of them being , another being the production version of the . Carlucci says he wants the Sport Crossover concept to ‘be kind of like an icon within these six dedicated BEVs.’ And Toyota Europe’s CEO and President, Yoshihiro Nakata, agrees. He says the Sport Crossover Concept is ‘the perfect style hero for our BEV portfolio.’ Officially, the production version of the Sport Crossover Concept is designed to above the bZ4X in the range. Given Toyota’s electric car nomenclature, it could mean that the production model could be called bZ5, or bZ6. We’ll have to stay tuned for more info.

543,New Nissan and the sports car renaissance,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/nissan/electric-sports-cars/,Ben Miller,2023-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan’s stonking Hyper Force concept isn’t, sadly, a new production-ready GT-R. Far from it. But it’s a compelling statement of intent, and confirmation of what we’ve known – and hoped – for a while: that Nissan’s performance icon will return, and as an EV. What’s more, buoyed by the success of the current Z, Nissan’s product planners are eyeing a return to a three-tier performance car line-up, all electric, with a new GT-R as its flagship. Product planning’s Ivan Espinoa: ‘We are committed to having a sports car offering in the future, this is for sure. They’re at the heart of what Nissan does. We make exciting cars for people who love cars and driving. We are passionate about this and that’s not going to change. This is at the root of what we do.’ While Nissan maintains a sports car presence in some territories with the Z, effectively an upgraded and rebodied 370Z, the UK and Europe has been starved of fast, fun Nissans for years. ‘Globally today, in the UK and Europe we had to stop the [sports car] offering because of the [emissions] regulations. Our fifth concept [the Hyper Force/next GT-R] is what we are considering doing in this space; a future hyper sportscar.’ Rival Toyota recently confirmed it’s on course to mass produce game-changing solid-state batteries by 2027. Nissan won’t be far behind, suggesting a new generation of Nissan sports cars could be with us within five years. ‘It’s all pivoting around the use of all solid-state batteries,’ explains Espinosa. The technology, which promises to drastically crank up cell power density, is key to delivering convincing sports EVs. But even if the next GT-R comes in at a comparable price point to GT-Rs past, it’ll still be expensive. Which is where Nissan’s three-tiered sports car strategy comes in. ‘Traditionally in our sports car line-up we’ve always had the GT-R as the highlight, a car like the Z in the middle and an entry-level car like the Pulsar,’ explains Espinosa. ‘Today we’re missing this point. Z is doing very well in terms of sales and customer satisfaction. In the future my dream is to keep these three elements – this could be the ideal sports car offering, with an affordable entry point for young buyers in their mid-20s who are passionate about cars. Because this is something some car manufacturers have forgotten about – the passion for cars. It depends on the country, but we see that young customers are less and less attracted to cars. And I think one of the reasons is we’re not offering something really exciting. With sports cars can we make that spark, you know, and bring the flame back.’ As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy. One of the team who's just as happy on two wheels as four."
544,New Smart #3: specs and details revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/smart/3-coupe-suv/,Jake Groves,2023-09-08,Car Magazine UK,"More details of Smart’s new #3 coupe SUV have been revealed ahead of its European launch. It’ll become the brand’s first foray into the coupe-SUV market where it’ll tackle cars like the , , and . Dirk Adelmann, CEO of Smart Europe, says: ‘Our goal has always been to address the multifaceted and changing needs for mobility. Therefore, smart will keep on expanding its product family to offer a variety of cars that optimally suit different customer groups and lifestyles.’ The Smart #3 shares its design language with the , retaining features like its rounded ‘shark nose’ front end, slimline LED headlights and A-shaped grille. Naturally, it’s a larger car with a more sloped roofline than the smaller #1. The new #3 measures 4400mm long and 1844mm wide. That makes this new car around 130mm longer and 160mm wider than the Smart #1. Inside, it looks remarkably similar to the #1, too. A high-up centre console, big centre screen (complete with some rather wacky animations) and a chunky steering wheel. Smart says the #3 also can be had with a head-up display and a 13-speaker Beats audio system. The trim levels in Europe will comprise Pro+ (pictured in black), Premium (pictured in grey) and a hot Brabus model (pictured in orange) with a sportier bodykit and larger wheels. On top of that, there’s also a 25th anniversary edition loaded with toys designed as a nod to – you guessed it – 25 years of Smart. All Smart #3 models have the same battery size: 66kWh. The Pro+, Premium and 25th Anniversary models all feature the same powertrain: a single e-motor on the rear axle developing 268bhp, good for a 5.8sec 0-62mph time and a top speed of 112mph. Smart says these models are capable of up to 282 miles on a charge and feature up to 150kW charging speeds. The Brabus model benefits from all-wheel drive via an additional motor on the front axle, meaning 422bhp is available. The top speed remains the same, but the Brabus spec sprints to 62mph in just 3.7 seconds. Range claims top out at 258 miles. Prices have only been confirmed for the German market so far (they start at €43,490 for a base Pro+) with the car launching towards the end of 2023 there. Elsewhere, including the UK, expect the #3 to go on sale in the first few months of 2024. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

545,Cupra Exponential Experience: wearing VR goggles at the wheel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/cupra-vr-driving-experience/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-09-08,Car Magazine UK,"Cupra is a young brand, which means it has the freedom to explore new ideas. That’s a real luxury in the car industry. Enduring, prestigious brands such as Porsche and Ferrari often lock horns with their fanbase each time they introduce a technological innovation. For example, when Porsche switched the 911’s power steering from hydraulic to electrical assistance in 2011, hordes of prescriptive devotees hurled vitriol at the company, simply because the change distanced the new car from the classic 911. It wasn’t how it used to be. Which is wrong. Apparently. But Cupra can basically do whatever it wants because every one of its customers is a new customer. It doesn’t have a heritage to uphold or a loyal fanbase to appease – and these liberties encourage bravery. Just look at its new . Cupra felt it didn’t rock the boat hard enough with its bold, shooting brake EV, though, so to test the limits of its bravery, the brand has created a new semi-virtual race car which allows the driver to tear around at race pace whilst wearing a VR headset. Crazy, we know. When Cupra told us we’d be driving this new concept racer, we envisaged an expensive accident in our immediate future. Crashes are normally inevitable when you drive a car under the influence of blindness – and, if it isn’t clear enough from the images, once you have the headset on, your visual connection to the physical world is cut. All you see is an arcade-style video game racetrack. You just have to trust there aren’t any obstacles in your real-world path. In the back of the car, there’s a powerful computer that runs the VR headset and the game it displays. The VR goggles are hard wired into the cabin and there’s a camera mounted on the dashboard that tracks the driver’s head movements so, when you move your head in real life, the virtual world you see through the headset moves with you. The computer also receives a constant stream of data about the position of the car’s pedals and steering wheel, which allows the virtual world to react in lockstep with the adjustments you make in the meat realm. And, just in case it all goes pear-shaped, there’s a Cupra racing driver sat in the passenger seat with one hand on the handbrake and the other on a massive kill switch. The upshot of all this clever tech (and a particularly patient racing driver) is that you can experience a virtual reality racetrack without any motion sickness. A common problem with conventional VR racing games is that the motion you view through your goggles isn’t synced with the G-forces you sense through your body – and that cognitive dissonance makes you feel sick because your brain can’t figure out whether you’re moving or not. You don’t get that with the Exponential Experience Concept, though. Turn a right-hand corner in the game and you’re slammed into the left-hand side of your seat, just like you would be in a real race car – because you’re really driving a real race car. You just have a screen on your face. The technology also means that racing rivals don’t need to be in the same place to have a tussle. Providing they both have an Urban Rebel racer and an empty car park to skid around in, they could connect to one another through the internet and race wheel-to-wheel in the virtual world. Cupra’s even trying to engineer a system that’ll make the physical car react if you bump into an opponent in the game. We grappled with this once we’d stepped out the car. We could appreciate the hard work that went into developing the concept, but we didn’t really understand the point of it. We’d rather have driven the car without the VR headset. But Cupra reckons the technology could make motorsports more attractive to younger audiences by presenting it in a format that appeals to them. Cupra says Gen Z is more interested in both playing and watching video games than they are in motorsports. So, the company is currently forging a partnership with a major video game streaming platform (Cupra hasn’t confirmed which one yet – but think the likes of Twitch or YouTube Gaming) so it can livestream the digital and physical elements of its semi-virtual racing series. It’s big business, too. Twitch says its platform hosts an average of 35 million visitors every day. To put that figure into context, the cumulative TV audience for the entire 2022 Formula One racing season (which lasts eight months) was around 1.54 billion. That means Twitch attracts the equivalent of F1’s entire yearly viewership every 44 days. Obviously, Cupra wants in on that hustle. Once you’re over the fear of bumping into stuff you can’t see, it’s surprisingly natural. The biggest drawback we recognised was the lack of peripheral vision, but the sensation isn’t too far removed from driving around a track whilst wearing a crash helmet. And Cupra assures us that the peripheral vision issue will improve with the next generation of VR headsets. Cupra hasn’t tried to ape the meat realm with the concept, either. The view from inside the VR goggles is like a neon version of the classic arcade racer , although some elements from modern racing sims have been thrown in for good measure. For example, there’s a racing line on the virtual tarmac (like you get in Forza Motorsport) that pops up with red warning triangles when you’re approaching the braking zone for a corner. If you’re a keen racing gamer, it’ll all feel very familiar. By the time our second lap rolled around, we felt more comfortable with the controls and were able to push a little harder. Our lap times started to tumble because – and here’s the strangest part – this VR-equipped concept is far less scary to drive quickly than a normal car. It must be something to do with fact there’s a barrier between your face and the real-world accident you’re trying to avoid. And you really can press on. The Urban Rebel is a seriously well-balanced car. The steering is joyfully communicative and there’s virtually no understeer. There’s also quite a lot of power. The racer has two electric motors producing 429bhp and, because it only weighs a shade over 1.2 tonnes, it accelerates like it’s been dropped from a crane. Because it has such an enormous amount of power, you can also make it oversteer if you’re exuberant enough. We didn’t get it particularly sideways, but we watched one of Cupra’s racing drivers smoking around the track like a semi-digital Ken Block. The biggest thing for us, though, was the noise. Unlike almost every other electric car we’ve driven, the Urban Rebel racer makes a proper racket. Its motors whine like a straight-cut gearbox from a classic rally car and there’s a constant background hum, which sounds a bit like a transformer being fed into blender. It was great to experience such savagery from a stereotypically clinical powertrain. Cupra just needs to capture that sensation for its next generation of electric road cars. Probably not. We spoke to several Cupra representatives and it quickly became obvious that this is more of a technical exercise than it is a disrupter for the likes of Formula One. Naturally, Cupra wants its new technology to be in the public eye, but it doesn’t want to sideline traditional motorsports to achieve that. Gavin Cheng, CEO of the eSports network FTW Worldwide (and a consultant for Cupra’s Exponential Experience project) said: ‘It’s an exploration. Nothing will ever replace, in Cupra’s mind, the thrill of actually driving a vehicle. This is core to them. On the other side, you have a generation raised on games. Gaming, influencing, Gran Turismo, Valorant – whatever it is – there’s this whole digital world that’s out there. ‘So, the idea is – is there a future evolution of motorsport that combines these two things while keeping the root of physical driving?’ He expanded on this sentiment, saying: ‘It’s about pushing the intersection between the digital and the physical world. And how can the core spirit of racing be honoured and brought in the new generation?’ We hope his vision bears fruit and that, instead of displacing motorsports altogether, Cupra’s Exponential Experience will grow into a sort of ‘gateway drug’ to get younger, streaming-savvy Gen Z audiences engaged with physical motorsport. It seems they’re tricky to court, though. Our most important take away from the day was that, if traditional motorsports want to keep a steady audience well into the future, they need to work harder on their social media campaigns and audience engagement.

546,VW ID.X Performance concept pushes the limits of ID EVs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-x/,Jake Groves,2023-09-12,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has revealed the ID.X Performance concept at 2023’s ID.Treffen electric car meet. The electric concept car is basically a heavily modified that’s had all sorts of upgrades thrown at it, allowing it to push the limits of the MEB architecture that lies beneath. It’s got a full on Need for Speed bodykit, complete with sharp front and rear splitters, as well as a rear wing made of carbonfibre, and centre-lock 20-inch wheels. VW also says the ID.X’s engineers have increased the toe by 80mm, and dropped the ride height of the ID.7 donor car by 60mm with properly performance-spec suspension. As for power, the ID.X Performance concept really pushes the limits of the MEB platform beneath the bodywork. Two e-motors develop a total of 550bhp, allowing for all-wheel drive power, with VW’s vehicle dynamics manager shuffling the power. As well as the platform’s standard permanently excited synchronous motor on the rear axle, there’s an additional asynchronous motor on the front axle, which VW says means the powertrain is capable of ‘a short-time overload capability and particularly low drag losses.’ ‘It was clear to us that we wanted to base our new show car on the ID.7 and that we would focus on enhancing the performance. In this way we can show what is possible,’ says Andreas Reckewerth, head of VW’s MEB technology office. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

547,Peugeot E-3008: smash-hit SUV goes pure electric,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/peugeot/3008/,Phil McNamara,2023-09-12,Car Magazine UK,"Peugeot is radically reinventing its 3008 crossover with pure electric power, a clean-sheet vehicle architecture and a striking new design inside and out. The midsize SUV has been critical to Peugeot’s renaissance, selling 1.32m units of the second-generation 3008 since 2017. ‘It’s a flagship for the Peugeot brand and the car that others in the C-SUV sector measure themselves against,’ says global head of marketing Phil York. And that’s not a groundless boast: Renault admits its lack of a 3008 rival has held the brand back, so it’s introducing as a rival. The headline news is that the 3008 is the lead car on . This ‘medium-sized’ chassis will underpin an expected two million cars per year, starting with the Peugeot which lands in UK retailers in spring 2024. Stellantis says it designed STLA Medium primarily as an electric car, but there will be a 1.2-litre mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions. It’s the E-3008 that’s the launch model, available with two big lithium-ion NMC batteries. The entry-level battery has 73kWh of usable energy, the long-range pack a mighty 98kWh. If you believe in EVs with right-sized batteries that consume fewer resources, look away now. But if you value big ranges, Peugeot reckons the standard pack covers 326 miles, the long-range variant a whopping 435 miles. Unlike in new Teslas where the battery pack is the floor of the car, the E-3008 has a steel underbody on top of the battery casing. Nonetheless the battery makes the new 3008 stiffer than its predecessor and contributes to the car’s crash performance by acting as a brace. The standard range E-3008 has a 157kW permanent magnet synchronous motor (213bhp) turning the front wheels. With 253lb ft of torque, the electric Peugeot can sprint from standstill to 62mph in 8.7secs, despite weighing a hefty 2114kg (similar to a ). Customers will also be able to choose a dual-motor version. This adds an 83kW (111bhp) motor to the rear axle for a combined 324bhp, and a 6.4secs acceleration time. This is the heaviest E-3008, weighing 2199kg. The 98kWh long range version uses a 170kW motor (233bhp), and while the extra mass adds two-tenths to the standard range’s 0-62mph time, drivers will get an extra 109 miles according to the WLTP test cycle. Peugeot claims STLA Medium has been optimised for best-in-class efficiency of 4.47 miles per kWh: we won’t know for sure until test drives this winter. The battery is liquid cooled and a heat pump optional. The E-3008 has a 400-volt electrical architecture and the standard on-board charger enables 11kW AC charging (from a three-phase wallbox), and 160kW DC charging across the line-up. That restores 100km (62 miles) in 10 minutes, with the E-3008 going from 20 to 80 per cent in 30 minutes. Both the front and rear motors can regenerate the battery under braking. Three brake modes – low, medium and high – can be selected via steering wheel paddles. The E-3008 body is suspended by struts up front and an independent multi-link axle which creates space for the rear motor; combustion powered models get a twist beam. The E-3008 has grown by about 100mm compared with the previous generation model, taking it to 4542mm long. That’s a bit shorter than VW’s ID.4. The E-3008 is 54mm wider than before to create extra battery capacity, ensuring they can be stowed in a single tier to lower the centre of gravity. The wheelbase is 64mm longer to boost interior space, and the boot stows 520 litres (dropping to 470l on all-wheel drive cars). The E-3008 is clearly recognisable as a Peugeot and includes many of its core design cues, while strikingly evolving them. The ‘three-claw’ light graphic from is used for the Daytime Running Lights, which blend into a shimmering and distinct grille: unlike Tesla, Polestar and Ford EVs, Peugeot isn’t abandoning the grille. The roofline is more coupe-like than its predecessor’s boxier, SUV shape: Peugeot calls it a fastback SUV. And it has plenty in common with Peugeot’s other fastback – – employing a similar, triangular rear window graphic and rear spoiler with ‘cats ears’ at the sides. The body surfaces are far less faceted than the 408’s: ‘it’s quite clean, you don’t have many, many lines’ says design director Matthias Hossann. He says that’s because the 3008 is a mature product, whereas the hatchback 408 is trying to gain presence in the executive car segment. The clean look is enhanced by hidden waistline seals, like the new ’s. But the budget didn’t extend to flush, aerodynamic door handles, though triangular bumper sections manage air flow along the side then reduce drag at the rear. Entry-level Allure trim gets 19in aerodynamic wheels; we’ve only seen the GT version, which rides on 20s. The GT’s interior has a beautiful, lounge-like vibe, with a 21inch curved screen that stretches from centre console to driver’s binnacle and is cleverly mounted to seemingly float above the dashboard. That’s wrapped in grey textile and is highlighted by curved metallic inserts, beautifully backlit with a choice of ambient colours. The Alcantara seats have the Peugeot logo embossed in the head restraints. There are very few physical buttons, but Peugeot has doubled the number of shortcut ‘iToggle’ haptic pads to 10, to which you can programme your favourite setting (such as cabin temperature and fan speed on the climate switch). Peugeot says the E-3008 will offer a range of connected services, including over-the-air updates and clever, real-time route planning taking remaining range into account (powered by Tom Tom). Six muted paint colours are available, and three GT option packs offer a sunroof, assisted driving and a Focal hi-fi, plus powered leather seats with heating, cooling and massaging functions."
548,Apple iPhone Lightning connector RIP: what it means for our cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/usb-c-and-apple-lightning-in-cars/,Tim Pollard,2023-09-12,Car Magazine UK,"Today’s news that the new Apple iPhone 15 is dropping its Lightning port in favour of the same USB-C connector used by Android phones ushers in yet more cabling complication for Europe’s motorists. I have a drawer in my desk stuffed with many of the cables you see here. I bet you do, too. Most are from archive phones of varying degrees of smartness, dating back to the early days of my mobile CV: the Nokia banana, Ericcson flip, Windows monstrosities, Qwerty Blackberries and iPhones that oscillated through myriad long-forgotten plugs and sockets over the years. Car manufacturers have had to navigate this tricky tightrope, keeping up with which ports to support. They’ve hopped from 3.5mm jacks through early iPod plugs, USB-A and now USB-C. It can be a connectivity catastrophe if you’re travelling in multiple cars – and many older devices still need to be plugged in if they can’t use wireless Bluetooth, or to connect. And don’t get me started on wireless charging pads… I often find they’re too slow to top up the charge being drained, meaning that the physical connector is still regularly used, no matter what the techheads say. Most car manufacturers have now settled on the Universal Serial Bus (USB) C, the most common socket found in modern vehicles. Now that Apple has been forced to follow suit with the , it will – eventually – make our lives somewhat easier, although iPhone-toting motorists may have to buy a replacement for their trusty Lightning cables in the short term. The 2023 Apple iPhone 15 switching to USB-C will accelerate the adoption of this standard in all new cars. Earlier USB sockets are set to be phased out pretty quickly, according to our manufacturer sources. The change is being enforced by the European Commission, which is on a mission to standardise connectivity for greater portability, cost and environmental reasons. A decade ago, there were upwards of 30 device chargers and that has now dropped to three, and soon one. New rules will force all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogame consoles sold in Europe to adopt USB-C. Around 420 million portable electronic devices are sold in the EU each year, making this a very real, very large problem. Each consumer owns an average of three mobile phone chargers, Brussels estimates – costing the public €2.4 billion (£2.1bn) and causing 11,000 tonnes of e-waste each year. Forcing Apple to adopt USB-C seems a good idea, long term. Just make sure you hold on to your old cables for now – as I suspect we’ll still need those old wires for many years to come. Although cars have become more like fast-moving consumer goods, their lifespan still typically stretches past a decade old. So today’s car vehicles will still require cables and plugs and wires to connect in the decades ahead, as they nudge into their dotage and cross the threshold to classic status. Unless I’ve somehow got my wires crossed, there’ll still be promotional shelves of cables and adapters in motorway service stations for many years to come.

549,Watch while you charge: Amazon Prime Video comes to Volvo and Polestar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/android-automotive-os/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-09-14,Car Magazine UK,"The was one of the first cars to use Google’s Android Human Machine Interface or HMI software – and now the search giant’s OS has been given a significant upgrade. Polestar has announced that Android’s Automotive OS can now run Amazon’s Prime Video. Yes, that means you’ll be able to watch Jack Reacher or Invincible in your sustainable EV – but presumably only when its stationary. The addition of Prime Video follows YouTube in June of 2023, and both video streaming service join a growing roster of apps that include Waze and AccuWeather. Polestar uses Android Automotive OS in the Polestar 2, but it’ll be the operating system of choice in the brand’s forthcoming models – so Prime Video will be available in the and 4, too. The successful launch and integration of Android Automotive OS in Polestar 2 has proven that we can leverage the best navigation and voice control in the business to make life with a Polestar easier,’ said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ‘The Google Play Store has also gained a rich variety of apps that offer interactivity and entertainment, from playing games to streaming series.’ Polestar’s parents brand Volvo isn’t far behind: although not as integrated with Google, the Swedish firm’s cars are also going Prime Video via the Google Play Store, with YouTube following soon too. Likewise, it’ll be preinstalled in Polestar cars shipped from 18 September, with a gradual OTA rollout in markets after that. It seems car makers are splitting into two distinct camps when it comes to infotainment: while some brands such as Mercedes are preferring to build their own bespoke operating systems and go it alone, many brands like Polestar and Volvo to an extent are preferring to partner up and leverage the expertise of existing tech giants.

550,Up close and personal with squared-off new Hyundai Santa Fe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/santa-fe/,CJ Hubbard,2023-09-14,Car Magazine UK,"The new Hyundai Santa Fe has made its debut in Europe, and we’ve had the chance to give it a proper poke and prod for the first time. Could this radical rethink turn this into one of the on sale? If you’re after and a distinctive look in combination with the image of an up and coming brand, then the 2024 Santa Fe could be coming for you. In the US this is considered a mid-size SUV but, yes, we’d file it in the ‘bloody big’ category over here. Compared with the previous model, both the wheelbase and the rear overhang have been stretched to create more space inside. But even without this, the boxy shape would be creating more presence. While there are shades of Discoveries past in the appearance, according to exterior design manager from the Hyundai Motor Europe Technical Center, Nicola Danza, it abrupt change in styling direction was more about distinguishing the fifth-generation Santa Fe from the ranks of sporty-looking SUVs currently on the market. Since the fourth-generation version hasn’t proven to be a massive seller, Danza explains the idea was to offer something distinctly different to this norm, making the new Santa Fe more fundamentally practical in the process. He describes the thinking as ‘anti-design’, resulting in the flat tailgate and roofline, and the overall visual of a traditional estate car on stilts. The one vehicle he references directly as an influence is the , which was very much in this mould. Though it looks boxy at a glance, the front and rear of the new Santa Fe are subtly curved in a manner intended to convey luxury. It’s still a big, flat-fronted shape to battle through the air, so a few aero tricks have been incorporated – most obviously the air-curtain vents and active cooling shutters in the front bumper. The vertical rear end actually has inherent aerodynamic advantages, so that’s fine, while the roofline is relatively low for this type of vehicle. It’s pretty clear that the design teams at Hyundai have a lot of freedom at the moment to present concepts that they think are right for the particular type of vehicle, rather than being force to reinterpret a fixed brand identity again and again. In this instance, Danza says the Santa Fe was even presented to management with square wheels to emphasis the theme. The strategy apparently worked, because we’re told the production version is fundamentally similar to that original idea. And although it doesn’t look like any other Hyundai in general, there are links in the details. It’s hard to miss those H-pattern lights, for instance, which reference the pixel lighting designs seen on other models. The whole point of the re-vectored exterior is to make the interior of the new Santa Fe better – a process Danza refers to as ‘thinking inside the box’. And it if it’s space you’re after, this has worked. Big adults won’t want to spend long in the rearmost row, but they will fit back there and they won’t have a problem with headroom; electrically assisted folding and shuffling of the middle row makes access easier, too. That middle row has bags of space, and neat tricks include the centre console box between the front seats having a lid that opens at both ends, making it easy for those middle-row dwellers to access the contents. The rear doors are long, mind, which might make access in tight car parks an issue (resolved by remote parking capability). And you’ll have to remember to duck your head, as the roofline is lower than in, say, a . Up front it’s all very plush and modern, with big curved screens, clear graphics and lots of cushy materials. It’s also hard not to notice the number of cupholders. We counted 12 before you even contemplate chucking a drinks bottle in the main door bins. This references the car-camping trend in Korea, which has been considered in the manner the rear seats fold flat and that you can now use the boot lip as a seat. See also the speculative accessories fitted to the outdoorsy XRT concept version (below), which include an exterior grab handle, rear ladder and chunky roof rack. It’s more than a bit , but could add some appeal. Note that you can already use the active shutters’ openings as a step at the front, should you need to access a roof tent or similar. Boot space is given as 725 litres, which is 91 litres more than the previous Santa Fe; this is measured with the rear-most seats folded, however, so don’t expect to get that much and seven people inside. This is where things get maybe a little bit disappointing. Hyundai has confirmed the European engine line-up as a choice between a regular 1.6-litre turbo petrol with 178bhp and a 1.6-litre turbo petrol with 158bhp. Both are equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrains also offer 195lb ft, but that doesn’t sound like a lot of power and muscle for such a substantial slab of  automotive transport. The PHEV Multivan has 215bhp, for instance, if we’re sticking with practical seven-seaters, while more traditionally premium seven-seater SUVs are available with far more. The Santa Fe should hit back with attractive pricing, but we’ve got more of a wait before this is confirmed. You can already buy a new South Korea, but deliveries to Europe and North America aren’t due to start until in the first half of 2024.

551,Honda Motocompacto: the electric scooter that folds into a briefcase,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/honda/motocompacto/,Tim Pollard,2023-09-15,Car Magazine UK,"Honda has a long history on two wheels and four – so it should come as no surprise that it’s revived one of its classic products: the Motocompo from the 1980s. The new Honda Motocompacto is a new electric scooter that folds, Transformer style, into a briefcase so it can be carried from your car or house. It’s very much a last-mile solution designed to keep pedestrians mobile in sprawling cities. There’s a pretty tiny 6.8Ah battery that provides enough oomph for a 12-mile range, according to Honda, and will charge back up in three-and-a-half hours. Top speed is just 15mph. When you arrive at your destination, the Honda Motocompacto folds back up into its own box (above), which weighs 19kg. A sturdy cargo, but one that can be lifted in to the boot of a car or left in an office bike park. ‘Motocompacto is easy to use and fun to ride, but was also designed with safety, durability, and security in mind,’ said Nick Ziraldo, project lead and design engineering unit leader at Honda Development and Manufacturing of America where it was designed. Thirty two patents have been filed for its folding mechanism. ‘It uses a robust heat-treated aluminium frame and wheels, bright LED headlight and taillight, side reflectors, and a welded steel lock loop on the kickstand that is compatible with most bike locks.’ We have asked Honda UK if they will sell the fold-up e-scooter on the side of the Atlantic. A spokeswoman told CAR: ‘There hasn’t been confirmation on if it will come to the UK at this point in time.’ In the US, the Motocompacto will cost $995, equivalent to £800 at current exchange rates.

552,The first plug-in pickup – Ford Ranger PHEV confirmed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/ranger-hybrid-pickup/,Tom Webster,2023-09-19,Car Magazine UK,"The is set to become the first pick-up truck to get a plug-in hybrid version, with the new model set to go on sale in early 2025. Although there are a couple of fully electric pick-ups either on sale or on their way to the UK they are from more fringe manufacturers – like the – and this is the first time that a mainstream brand has signalled its intent to provide a truck that you can plug into the mains. The Ranger Plug-in Hybrid will pair a 2.3-litre petrol engine with a motor that will be capable of a fully electric range of 28 miles. This will be Ford’s first non-diesel Ranger, but it claims that the PHEV will be able to match its existing models in several areas that are crucial to pick-up buyers. Payload and towing ability are two crucial factors in the pick-up market, and Ford says that the plug-in Ranger will be able to match its diesel counterparts on this front. It stopped short of naming figures, but it told CAR that: ‘There will definitely be variants of the PHEV that meet the 1.0-tonne payload – we have engineered the vehicle to meet that.’ The 1.0-tonne payload barrier means that the Ranger Plug-in Hybrid can be classified as a commercial vehicle, which means that buyers will be able to take advantage of tax benefits in the UK, such as being able to reclaim the VAT. This is something that the performance Ford Ranger Raptor is unable to do. Ford has also said that the plug-in Ranger will be able to offer the same 3.5-tonne towing ability as the diesel model. In fact, it says that the low-down abilities of the electric motor means that it will have more torque than any other Ranger pick-up. It also says that it will offer better driveability and be more refined to boot – no more clattery starts that rouse the neighbours at 6am… Ford might well have had ‘make a Ranger Plug-in Hybrid’ on the to-do list right from the start while developing the new pick-up, but it has still had to make some amendments to the diesel version. The rear frame has been upgraded to take the heavier electric gear, while it has heavy-duty suspension, tuned steering and a recalibrated combustion engine. About that engine – Ford has chosen to put a 2.3-litre version of the Ecoboost engine in rather than the 2.5-litre version that will sit in the next Ford Transit Custom PHEV. That’s because that hybrid setup isn’t as geared towards towing, apparently. The other crucial addition is the three 10A external power sockets. There is one in the cabin and two in the loading bay (below), and they are capable of powering tools out on site, turning the Ranger into a sort-of mobile generator. Production of the Ford Ranger Plug-in Hybrid doesn’t start until late 2024, with the first vehicles not heading to the UK until early 2025. Unsurprisingly, Ford is remaining tight-lipped on pricing until a bit closer to the time. It’s also remaining quiet on the precise details of weights, payloads and the battery and motor capabilities. As with the pricing, expect more information as we get closer to the on-sale date. We’ll update this page when we have the full specs.

553,New Fiat 600e: UK pricing announced for new electric SUV with 250-mile range,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/fiat/600e/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-09-19,Car Magazine UK,"‘ UK pricing has been announced for the new Fiat 600e. The Italian brand’s new will soon do battle with heavy EV hitters such as the and as well as compact electric SUVs including the and with prices starting at a relatively reasonable £32,995. Order books will open in October 2023, and first deliveries expected in early 2024. Unlike the , which is based on a bespoke electric platform, the 600e is underpinned by common Stellantis architecture. It shows FCA and PSA’s development departments are finally starting to merge – and it should allow Fiat to turn a greater profit on each car it sells. The 600e is also the company’s first foray into the electric family car market. The 500e is great for zipping around town, but it struggles when asked to deal with toddlers and their associated detritus. By not having a horse in the race, Fiat has been throwing business away – and buyers have been flocking to companies such as Volkswagen and Tesla for their practical EV fix. But, despite being on the back foot, Fiat refuses to tackle this problem in a boring manner. Because the bulk of the engineering is being handled by the Stellantis parts bin, the company has gone all-in on style for the 600e, hoping to trade on its Italian flair and charm. But is that enough? We’ve spent some time in the studio with the quirky new EV to get to the bottom of it. Surprise! It’s the same e-CMP architecture that props up the . The same platform will also be deployed under the updated versions of the and but because they’re brand-new cars, the Fiat and Jeep have beaten their stablemates to the punch. Like the Avenger , the Fiat 600e is powered by a 54kWh battery pack. It drives a 154bhp electric motor mounted on the front axle, which has enough grunt to push the hatchback from 0–62mph in nine seconds flat. Fiat also says the 600e has a maximum range of 250 miles on the WLTP combined cycle – but that figure soars to 372 miles if you only drive the car around town. The little Fiat also supports 100kW DC rapid charging as standard, which can charge the battery up to 80 percent capacity in less than half an hour. If you can find a quick enough charging station, it’s also compatible with 11kW AC charging, which can brim the battery in around six hours. We’d like to backtrack slightly and tackle Fiat’s style-led marketing approach. The company recently announced it would stop selling grey cars because the colour grey doesn’t align with its philosophy. Even though it’s the most popular colour for new cars in the UK, Fiat reckons it’s dull and depressing – and, quite frankly, it reckons its customers deserve better. So, the 600e won’t be offered in grey – and woe betide anyone who asks for it. From launch, there’ll be four colour palettes available called Sun of Italy, Sea of Italy, Earth of Italy and Sky of Italy. Italian. And no, that isn’t a euphemism for its reliability. It’s very attractive, rather delicate and is trimmed in stylish materials. We’re not sure it’s the most practical option on sale – rivals such as the Kia Niro EV and have better interior storage and more legroom in the back – but it’s a pleasant place to be. There’s more than a passing resemblance to the 500e and the Jeep Avenger. The steering wheel and climate controls are shared with the city car, while the centre console and 10.25-inch touchscreen have been transferred wholesale from the SUV. The dashboard is slightly more curvaceous than the Avenger’s, but the changes are only skin-deep. The vents and mounts are all in the same place. Buyers won’t be wanting for equipment, though. Available features include a handsfree tailgate, automatic air conditioning, rain-sensing wipers and automatic lights. You can also have a connected navigation system with real-time traffic, parking and charging station updates. Boot space is average rather than class-leading at 360 litres, although you do get a handy under bonnet storage area for your charging cables, which is more than can be said of the MG 4 and Volkswagen ID.3. And if you fold the rear seats flat, boot space expands to 1,231 litres, which is entirely respectable. Despite the Fiat 600e have a starting price of €29,500 in Italy that makes it more than €5,000 more expensive than the mechanically identical Jeep Avenger, in the UK those positions are reversed. The 600e’s £32,995 entry point undercut’s the Avenger’s £35,700 by a useful margin. The entry-level 600e will be trimmed in Fiat’s (RED) specification. It’s a tie-in with the international charity of the same name that aims to bring companies together in the fight against AIDS. The model will be painted red and will feature red interior detailing, model-specific recycled seat upholstery and a unique centre console lid with the (RED) logo. Above that, there’s the La Prima model shown in the pictures here. This costs from £36,995 and gets synthetic leather upholstery, an electrically adjustable and massaging driver’s seat and heating elements for both front seats. Other features include a wireless smartphone charger, keyless entry and a range of charging ports around the cabin.

554,Volvo axes all diesel engines from spring 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/volvo-abandons-diesel-engines/,Tim Pollard,2023-09-19,Car Magazine UK,"In news that’ll surprise nobody, Volvo Cars has announced it’ll kill off all diesel engines early next year – focusing instead on pure and hybrid petrol models. The Swedish car maker made the announcement at Climate Week NYC in the US. ‘Electric powertrains are our future, and superior to combustion engines: they generate less noise, less vibration, less servicing costs for our customers and zero tailpipe emissions,’ said Volvo CEO Jim Rowan. ‘We’re fully focused on creating a broad portfolio of premium, fully electric cars that deliver on everything our customers expect from a Volvo – and are a key part of our response to climate change.’ Volvo will stop building diesel engines in early 2024 and the manufacturer confirmed it is no longer investing in combustion engines at all. ‘We’re no longer spending a single krona of our R&D budget on developing new internal combustion engines,’ it revealed in a statement. As recently as 2019, diesel engines made up the majority of Volvo production globally, the company admitted. The growing importance of sustainability and the fall-out from Covid lockdowns and supply chain issues have accelerated the electric transformation at Volvo, and other car makers. It is far from the first manufacturer to abandon diesel engines; brands like Porsche committed to dropping derv as long ago as 2018, in the wake of the at parent company Volkswagen. Volvo has now thrown its industrial might behind fully electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrains.

555,"New Fiat 600 Hybrid puts the 600e on ICE, slowly",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/fiat/600-hybrid/,CJ Hubbard,2023-09-19,Car Magazine UK,"In further shock news that , Fiat has announced the 600 Hybrid – a dinosaur-chewing companion car to the 600e . This new b-segment warrior brings the mighty power of a 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine to the family car battle ground, an area of the market Fiat has largely been avoiding of late. Reasons to read further about the 600 Hybrid include the ability to move on electric power alone – still relatively unusual for a mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) – and that it has been developed to service regions where conversion to ‘is still at a slower pace’. It’s set to go on sale in the UK in late 2024. Looking indistinguishable from the , which is to say as sleepy as any SUV we’ve ever seen, the 600 Hybrid sports what Fiat refers to as a ‘P2 hybrid’ package. The 1.2-litre triple produces 99bhp all by itself, but is mated to a belt-driven starter generator and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with an integrated 21kW electric motor. This e-motor not only boosts low speed response, it’s also able to move the car all by itself at speeds of up to 18mph (30kmh) thanks to the ‘e-launch’ mode and on-board lithium-ion battery. There are three other e- modes that also utilise this ability: e-creeping (foot off low-speed crawling as per a conventional automatic); e-queuing (in traffic jams), and; e-parking. If e-creeping isn’t the worst name for any innovation on any car launched in 2023, we’ll eat our e-hats. As the MHEV system also recovers energy under deceleration it should help with fuel economy and CO2 emissions, which are expected to be 110-114g/km, depending on spec. The petrol engine uses the Miller cycle for optimised economy as well. It’s no rocketship, however, with Fiat saying ‘the brilliant New Fiat 600 Hybrid features acceleration to 100 km/h in just about 11 seconds.’ Yes, just about. Even for a B-SUV this is a compact car at just 4.17m in length. You can get five people in, but our time spent with the 600e suggests four will be more comfortable. The boot is 385 litres, which is merely ok for this class now. There are two specifications. At the top of the range sits La Prima, a name already familiar from the and 600e. Below this, the regular 600 Hybrid model comes ‘exclusively’ with recycled-fabric seats with white accents and a black bio-plastic dashboard fascia. All models get paddleshifters and an e-Auto Off mode that stops the car shutting down the petrol engine. Which immediately makes us slightly suspicious of the state of the calibration (having driven early examples of the mild hybrid) but there’s quite some time to go before it reaches the UK anyway. The platform is the same Stellantis e-CMP basis as the . The next-gen Peugeot 2008 and Vauxhall Mokka models also use it. Pricing has already been announced in Italy, where you’ll be able to get a 600 Hybrid for 19,950 Euros thanks to current incentives – the regular list price is 24,950 Euros. That’s equivalent to around £21,500 at the moment, but is unlikely to translate directly to the UK even before we consider what might happen between now and the second half of 2024 when the 600 Hybrid is scheduled to be available here.

556,BMW prepares new naming system for Neue Klasse era,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bmw/bmw-nomenclature-new-model-names/,Georg Kacher,2023-09-20,Car Magazine UK,"Applications filed with the EU trademark authorities suggest a pending change of BMW badges and nomenclature which will kick off with the Neue Klasse launch. The concept car shown at this autumn’s is a precursor to the new generation of electric cars being readied in Munich, heralding the direction of travel for the next 3-series and all future mainstream models. But as well as the tech and design story, CAR understands the new era will also usher in a new type of naming convention. BMW will continue to hedge its powertrain bets, offering a choice of pure electric or increasingly hybridised combustion versions. This continues the theme started with the and petrol , but those badges will soon converge. CAR magazine’s sources suggest that the first new arrival based on the Neue Klasse technology stack, the X3 family, will be rebadged X320 and X330 for combustion derivatives, while the all-electric iX3 option will be called iX330, iX340 and iX350. It seems the different naming conventions of ICE and EV BMWs will converge. Our sources suggest the same formula is valid for heartland saloons and Tourings, too – it’s less of a shock to hear 3-series models called 330 or 340 (i330/i340 for electric models), while loftier numbers such as 560, 660 and 760 grace top-of-the-line models. Cleverly, it allows the familiar ‘3-series’ and ‘5-series’ family names to continue, but realigns the individual constituent models below. It’s an attempt to blend the occasional bumpy alphabet soup of letters and numerals spawned by the ever-more complex technical landscape. Work it through: the proposed flexible badging system can reflect different bodystyles, model hierarchies and power/battery capacity with a single common style. When you realise the i3 is the chosen name for the electric 3-series version coming in 2026, you realise why BMW had to retire the original stubby electric supermini pioneer last summer. One of the world's leading motoring journalists, Georg has been a staple on CAR magazine for six decades. Incredible, but true. This extraordinary experience means that Georg has probably scooped it, driven it and rated it before anybody else!"
557,David Brown reveals Mini eMastered: the electrified classic that’ll cost you £150k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/david-brown/mini-emastered/,CAR magazine,2023-09-20,Car Magazine UK,"Here’s a restomod with a twist: the new Mini eMastered – a classic Mini hatchback that’s been converted to run on electricity. It’s the latest, surprisingly costly creation from David Brown Automotive. Best known for the earlier and its resurrected , the firm has taken the beloved classic Mini and given it an all-electric twist with some other modern creature comforts. In a bid to keep the car’s compact size, weight and handling prowess, David Brown opted for a relatively small 18.8kWh battery pack – all that’s needed for such a small car. It claims 0-62mph in just 8.5 seconds. The compact battery has a range of 110 miles – a handy range if you just want to cruise around London emissions-free. Be aware however of the slow charging rate (just 6.6kWh on a wallbox is your lot; no rapid charging here). It appears that embarking on the journey of an electric future comes at a price: the Mini eMastered costs a staggering £150,000. That lofty cost may leave you wondering if you’re paying for an electric vehicle or a piece of automotive history. But for those who can’t resist the allure of a classic Mini EV, it may be a small price to pay to make a big, modern statement. Impressively, David Brown claims the Mini e-Mastered weighs just 640kg, the same weight as the original donor car with its original combustion engine. Step inside the cabin and you’ll notice a load of interior adjustments too, with modern niceties such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Happily, the instrumentation remains delightfully analogue. Michelle Gay, sales and marketing director at David Brown, said: ‘There is an inherent challenge in electrifying such an iconic model, to retain the high levels of reliability, performance, and quality that our customers expect. ‘Mini eMastered is a shape that captures hearts and minds, and it is the embodiment of our passion, vision, and commitment to sustainable luxury.’"
558,Ineos CEO Lynn Calder: 2035 is a more realistic target,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/ineos/lynn-calder/,Colin Overland,2023-09-21,Car Magazine UK,"Ineos CEO Lynn Calder has expressed her support for – but has warned that betting solely on EV may prove costly. Echoing comments made at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, Calder outlined the pitfalls of pursuing electric cars as the only alternative to ICE. Calder, in the job for just under a year now, is walking the same tightrope as every other industry boss: trying to decide which powertrain technology to back and at what velocity. It’s the most important strategic decision facing any chief exec – but it’s acutely pressing for Ineos, a small fledgling car manufacturer. ‘2035 is a more realistic target for consumers to switch to net zero vehicles and will allow the industry to meet the challenge,’ she said. ‘But achieving this target is made harder by the current singular focus on EVs as there is a real risk that that we will fail and that it will be more expensive for consumers, with the whole industry competing for finite resources such as the lithium crucial for batteries.’ Instead, Calder asked for similar levels of investment in other technologies such as a hydrogen: ‘We need support for other technologies such as hydrogen and alternative fuels in the same way these alternatives are being supported by other countries.’ ‘I think all the automotive manufacturers are fully on board with decarbonising and finding the solution,’ Calder said. ‘We as an industry have some of the best brains on the planet. We are going to solve this. But a) we need time and b) we need to be open and innovating constantly, not saying “This is the one we pick and we go down that road”.’ To her the UK government’s insistence on an end to combustion-car sales in 2030 is not a coherent plan: ‘I’d like to see some policy. It’s a statement of intent with no means of getting there. What we’ve seen in the US more recently is intent plus some means of getting there, with the IRA [President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, involving $369 billion of funding for climate-related spending and clean-energy tax credits], saying we’re going to create some incentives and we’re going to incentivise technology, what’s going to actually solve this problem.’ Going electric, especially in a hurry, is inherently expensive. In the case of the that Calder plans to have on sale in 2026, the powertrain costs roughly three times as much as a combustion equivalent. ‘It will only get worse as more and more countries pull from those limited raw materials. ‘What does failure mean? It means we don’t hit the targets on time. But failure also means we might hit the targets on time, but if everyone is fighting for the same raw materials in the world, it’s going to make it extremely expensive, and I fear that politicians are not quite understanding the gravity of what we have to achieve in such a short space of time. We might pretty much price consumers out of the car.’ Ineos Automotive has a fully functioning hydrogen fuel-cell version of the Grenadier, developed using some BMW technology and considerable know-how from elsewhere in the Ineos empire. ‘I think people would buy it but they need to be comforted that it’s a car they can use, and to use it they need to be able to refill it. That’s the frustration with policy at the moment – they’re picking horses and backing them, and I don’t think it’s wise. ‘We need a mix, we need different technologies that are going to get us there, otherwise we’re going to back a horse and we’re going to fail. EV, electrification, is a huge part of the solution, and we’re so into it, we’re building one. We really do think it’s a part of the solution, but the government’s saying it’s 100% of the solution.’ Calder is adamant that Ineos Automotive is here for the long term. ‘Our vision is that we want to be a long-term automotive player. We’re not here for five minutes, to show we can do it [build a successor to the classic Land Rover Defender, in the shape of the Grenadier and now the Quartermaster pick-up, below]. ‘We’ve spent a lot of time in our own echo chamber with the Grenadier,’ she added. ‘When all you’re doing is listening to your own opinions, then everyone can be in great alignment and it’s all fantastic. But now we’re going to hear what everyone thinks. We’ve always said the public, the consumer, will be the judge of this vehicle. We will hear all sorts of things we don’t like. I want to listen to that, it’s really important. ‘I recognise really keenly the challenges we face as a new player. Such a big transition. Pretty much unprecedented. We feel like it’s been over 100 years since the industry has faced quite this much change. To be successful at that, and to be here in decades’ time, we need a portfolio of products, and the technology that’s needed for them. There’s going to have to be different powertrains to satisfy all the different markets. Electric isn’t going to work everywhere, hydrogen isn’t going to work everywhere, combustion isn’t going to work everywhere. How do you balance that portfolio in all of the 40-plus markets we’re going to be in, so that we’ve got that portfolio that people are going to say, “Yes, that’s the one I want”? ‘The battery-electric that’s coming in 2026 won’t be a Grenadier. It will still have that off-road DNA of course, but it won’t be a Grenadier, so we really are moving towards a portfolio of products. Phase two is business mode, having a business that’s long-term viable and being a customer-centric organisation, not a product-centric organisation, and that’s taking a bit of time. The organisation is moving from phase one to phase two. We’ve got a lot of people who have only ever known start-up. And now we’re trying to get towards business-as-usual mode, trying to get to run a business with monthly accounts and KPIs and things that we have to achieve.’ ‘There is part of me that wants to retain the good parts of that: the agilty, the small-company feel where everyone feels like they’re pulling together to achieve something big. In the early days of phase two, we’re certainly still that. That attitude of get things done – we still retain that. But start-up mode also means it’s a bit chaotic. We need a bit of structure in order to be able to get where we want to go, in order to satisfy the hundreds of thousands of customers that we’ll have by the end of this decade. We need to grow up. ‘This is – sorry to use a horrible car pun – where the rubber hits the road; we’re going to find out how good we are, or not. ‘I’ve got a lot of experts in this business who know this industry inside out and back to front and I’d be an idiot not to listen to those people. We’ve built a really solid team over the last eight months that I’ve been in the business, and really proud how we’ve come together, and merged the automotive and non-automotive backgrounds that we now have. We’re doing a really good job of listening to each other. ‘We have our days when we’re like, gosh, this is really hard – because it is, it’s hard. But I certainly wouldn’t want to be doing any other job. We are so excited about what’s next. There is so much change going on at the moment. The rulebook is being rewritten, whether people like it or not. It’s a lot, but my god it’s exciting.’ Pre-orders for the Grenadier have been going well in the USA, says Calder, but Ineos is keen to not rush into that massive market without first applying the lessons from the roll-out of the Grenadier in the UK, Europe and Australia, which involved some supply glitches and frustrating delays for customers. ‘I’m not going to sit here and pretend it will be seamless,’ Calder admits. ‘It’s a new distribution channel that we’re opening up. We have learned so much since we started production in October 2022, we have learnt as an organisation an enormous amount, and a huge amount of that will be brought to bear for the US. I think it will be a very different experience from us launching in the rest of the world. ‘We’ve tested our systems in anger now. We’re really in a much better space. We’ll come across things we’ve not come across yet, and we’ll have our moments. But we have learned shedloads. It will be a completely different experience, for us as a business, and for the end consumer.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
559,How to pay for your Merc's fuel – with your fingerprint,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-in-car-pay-mastercard/,Tim Pollard,2023-09-25,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-Benz will offer customers in-car payments via Mastercard, in what’s being touted as the world-first roll-out of the technology by a car maker. The embedded in-car payments are enabled by a biometric fingerprint sensor built into the MBUX infotainment system, which validates any purchase at a shop or petrol station before authorising payment via the credit or debit card. At first, the scheme will be available in more than 3600 service stations in Germany, but it is expected to roll out globally in key markets where deals are in place. Merc’s scheme harnesses the power of Mastercard Secure Card on File for Commerce platforms technology, which is now integrated into MBUX. It has leading edge security and encryption standards to keep payments safe and secure, according to Daimler. It means that owners in Germany can pay for their fuel at a service station using just their fingerprint, without the need to authenticate via a PIN or mobile phone. When you arrive at a connected service station and switch off to refuel, the Mercedes Me Fuel & Pay screen will automatically show on the touchscreen; drivers select the nozzle number they want to use and fill up. Once they have finished, the total amount will be shown on screen which can be confirmed and paid for with a simple tap of the finger – with no need to walk into the store. Mercedes and Masercard surveyed the market and found that half of 18- to 39-year-olds would order and pay for goods and services from their car’s touchscreen. It’s one of the next big things, it seems. ‘With Mercedes Pay+, we are making everyday life easier for our customers,’ said Franz Reiner, chairman of Mercedes-Benz Mobility. ‘From now on, they can pay their fuel bill directly from their car using their fingerprint – simply, securely, and conveniently. An intuitive payment process and a best-in-class customer experience lay the foundation for the success of digital offerings. We are pioneers in native in-car payment and are already working on the integration of further services.’ Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

560,Nissan Concept 20-23: an electric hot hatch to celebrate 20 years of European design – and preview the next Micra,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/concept-20-23/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-09-25,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Nissan Concept 20-23, designed to celebrate two decades of the brand’s European design office – as well as giving a sneak preview of the next-gen . Unveiled opposite Nissan Design Europe (NDE) in London by company’s President and CEO Makoto Uchida, the new concept takes inspiration from Nissan’s electric Formula E program – as well as its propensity for penning striking hatchbacks. As you’d expect from 2023, the new concept has been described by Nissan as both ‘sporty’ and ‘urban,’ and was drawn up by a cohort of the NDE that involved some younger members. The brief was to create a car that’d be fun to drive on the streets where they work – wishful thinking as any Londoner can tell you. ‘The young team here at NDE was given a simple brief: design a fun electric city car that you’d like to drive every day in London,’ said Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan’s senior vice president for global design. ‘The 20-23 Concept that they designed is a compact hatchback which is strongly influenced by the online racing world. I love the story it tells about how the worlds of modern city living, online gaming and zero emissions mobility intersect.’ Still, the Concept 20-23 certainly plays the part of neo-city hot hatch. A compact three-door hatch, combined with a rally car, it’s an EV covered with aero furniture and even features an air intake on the roof. Of course, the roof scoop is just there to ventilate the interior – there’s no mid-mounted V6 or turbocharged inline-four to feed. At the front, Nissan has given the car what it calls a friendly appearance, with circular LED lights with integrated indicators. The same friendly LED light design is found at the rear, too. Everywhere else though, the 20-23 is aggressive as you’d expect from a sporty hatch. The Concept 20-23 has an ambitious amount of aero for a car that’s designed to drive in London: a front spoiler channels air through the brake ducts and then out again, while deep skirts and flared wheel arches give the Nissan concept some serious road presence. NDE has also added Porsche GT3-style louvres above the wheel arches to dissipate pressure in the wheel bays. The Concept 20-23 also features rear side vents to cool the brakes, and the whole thing is finished off with a huge, single-piece spoiler that grows from the roof rail. The result is a spoiler that doesn’t actually obscure the view out the back of the 20-23, which is particularly useful for a city car. NDE hasn’t furnished the inside of the concept, but Nissan’s designers have put forward an idea of what the cabin could look like. As you’d expect from a concept, the 20-23 has scissor doors which open to reveal a suitably sporty, futuristic interior. The theme is bare functionality, so there’s a brace bar and two bucket seats, while a super-long steering column adds to the Group B and racecar feel of the Concept 20-23. Front and centre is rectangular steering wheel, featuring switches and knobs that’d control every parameter of the car’s electric powertrain. The Concept 20-23 is a neat play on English and Japanese; the first half of its name references twenty years of Nissan design in Europe, and the rest is a nod to the company’s traditional number 2 (ni) 3 (san) as well as the current year. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
561,Mercedes-AMG GLC Coupe unveiled – with slam-dunk roofline and four-cylinder thump,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/amg-glc/,Jake Groves,2023-09-26,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-AMG has revealed its latest GLC version in two flavours: 43 and 63 S E-Performance. And Stuttgart has now shown both new 2023 bodystyles – you can choose your AMG GLC as an original SUV or sleeker coupe with a slightly sloping roofline. The new Mercedes-AMG GLC Coupe (silver car, below) mixes the top hat of a more sporting roofline with the taller ride height and poise of an SUV. Some may find it a curious mix, pioneered by the original first-generation back in 2008 and latterly the . Buyers seem to lap them up, however, which is why manufacturers keep producing them. Mechanically, the two different GLC bodystyles are practically identical, give or take some bespoke tuning of suspension settings and the like. Both hot new SUVs features a lot of the same engineering and tech as the latest AMG C-Class model, including the downsizing of its engine to a four-cylinder. The days of thundering V8s in mainstream Mercs are, sadly, over… Go for the AMG GLC 43 (pictured as a blue SUV, below) and you’ll benefit from a mild hybrid 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine mated to a nine-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Mercedes-AMG says the engine develops 416bhp and means the 43 can sprint to 62mph in 4.8 seconds and onto a limited top speed of 155mph. As for the 63 S E-Performance, that four-cylinder engine gains a battery and electric motor with its own two-speed transmission, for a mind-bending total of 671bhp. The benchmark 0-62mph sprint is done in 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 171mph possible. The e-motor has an electronic limited-slip differential on the rear axle, and Mercedes-AMG says the battery is designed for performance, not range – so there’s only seven miles of zero-emissions driving possible. Both powertrains in the new 2023 Mercedes-AMG GLC are all-wheel drive (albeit with different power-shuffling abilities: the 43’s 4Matic can distribute power 31/69 front/rear, while the 63 can split it 50/50 with its 4Matic+ system) and both use a turbocharger with an electronic wastegate. Both go-faster GLCs have adaptive dampers via AMG’s Ride Control tech and rear-wheel steering. Go for the 63 and you’ll benefit from active roll control. As well as an angry body kit and bigger, sportier wheel designs, the AMG GLC models feature some sportier settings within its MBUX infotainment software including the brand’s Track Pace app that monitors lap times and some new instrument cluster designs. Thin, sporty AMG Performance seats are an option. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

562,Record number of Welsh motorists sign petition in protest at new 20mph speed limits,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/20mph-speed-limit/,Seth Walton,2023-09-26,Car Magazine UK,"A opposing the new blanket 20mph speed limits in Welsh towns has amassed 431,598 signatures in just a week. It’s the biggest online petition ever received by the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, which has to debate any topic receiving more than 10,000 signatures – even though it is not legally bound to change policy. The previous petition record was a poll held in lockdown requesting that supermarkets could sell non-essential items; it received 67,940 signatures. The title of the petition is: ‘We want the Welsh Government to rescind and remove the disastrous 20mph law.’ Hundreds of people protested in Cardiff at the weekend, demonstrating against the new 20mph limits. A map created by analyses the data of where in Wales signatories are based, showing that it’s been signed by motorists in the more built-up north and south towns of Wales who are most incensed by the lower limit. The Welsh government lowered the default speed limit on urban roads in Wales from 30mph to 20mph on 17 September 2023. Restricted roads are usually found within residential areas where streetlights are placed no more than 200 yards apart. While the new speed limit applies to most busy pedestrian streets across Wales, it is not a blanket limit on all restricted roads and there will be some exceptions to the rule. Highway authorities have been granted the prerogative to decide which roads should remain at 30mph after consulting with their local communities. The new speed limit is expected to cost £32 million, though the Welsh government has assured that the cost will be ‘outweighed by casualty prevention savings’. A public health study has estimated these savings could be up to £92m per year. The new speed limit has been called upon to lower the number of traffic-related injuries in residential areas. The new 20mph default speed limit could result in 1200 to 2000 fewer injuries a year with 40% fewer collisions, according to a public health study. The initiative is also expected to encourage a shift towards more active methods of travel such as cycling and walking – incentivising more physical activity to reduce taxpayer costs while lowering the NHS workload in Wales. Though English local authorities have the power to impose 20mph limits on their roads, the default speed limit on restricted roads is still 30mph in England. Some councils have introduced the lower limit, most commonly near schools. There have been calls to reduce the default limit on restricted roads to 20mph from campaign groups and road safety experts, but they’ve been met with resistance from MPs. The government has considered cracking down on local 20mph speed limits following prime minister Rishi Sunak’s criticism of Labour’s road policies as ‘anti-motorist’, vowing that he is ‘on the side’ of English drivers. In Scotland, local authorities in Edinburgh and the Scottish Borders region have already rolled out permanent 20mph limits on restricted roads. Although charities have requested the Scottish government follow Wales by setting a 20mph default speed limit, as it stands the default limit is still 30mph.

563,Production-spec Genesis GV80 Coupe revealed as part of SUV's 2023 facelift,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/gv80-coupe/,Jake Groves,2023-09-27,Car Magazine UK,"Remember the GV80 Coupe Concept? Genesis showed it off at the 2023 New York motor show, complete with a punchy V6 engine and even punchier orange paint scheme. Now, though, Genesis has confirmed the GV80 Coupe has made production, and it’s expected to become part of the brand’s line-up in Europe. Given it wasn’t that much of a stretch to imagine a ‘coupe’ version of an SUV that already exists, the GV80 Coupe doesn’t stray too much at all from the GV80 SUV’s design. The new bodystyle launches at the same time as a near-imperceptible facelift for the GV80 SUV. Genesis says that (besides the roofline and rear redesign) specific wheel designs and revised air intakes with an active air flap feature in the Coupe’s exterior design. The interior has also been given a gentle going over and includes carbonfibre and brushed metal detailing. As well as the brand’s regular 2.5-litre turbo four and 3.5-litre turbo six, Genesis says the GV80 Coupe also launches with another 3.5-litre V6 that is both turbocharged and supercharged. Power is rated at 409bhp and 311lb ft. If you spec that engine, your GV80 Coupe also benefits from a Sport+ mode and launch control, as well as customisable sounds for the engine and even adjustable brake pedal response. The new GV80 Coupe is likely to launch in 2024, including in Europe. By not a great deal, really. The Korean luxury brand says the concept was designed as a ‘statement of intent for the future, hinting towards more emotional and performance-oriented models.’ This corroborates with that Genesis is working on fleshing out its future pure-electric offerings with a grand touring flagship based on its Speedium concept cars. Genesis says the GV80 Coupe Concept uses a rear-wheel drive platform – in keeping with the brand’s efforts to build something at least slightly sportier than their current offerings – but no performance specs are given. In order to emphasise that supposed sportiness, the GV80 Coupe Concept is finished in a wild Magma orange paintwork with some satin grey details. The cockpit includes four bucket seats and a G-Matrix strut brace for extra rigidity. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

585,Mercedes E-Class in-car video calling: does it work?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-e-class-video-calling-does-it-work-/,Jake Groves,2023-10-26,Car Magazine UK,"Just to ram the point home that the E-Class is the techiest car of its size, Mercedes has absolutely gone to town on new features. , a new generation of its infotainment system, which chief technology officer Markus Schäfer says has been developed completely in-house. With MB.OS, Mercedes has also introduced the opportunity to install various apps, further evolving the (not universally popular) idea that your car is an extension of your phone. During the launch of the E-Class ( ), Mercedes had TikTok and Angry Birds installed on the cars we tested and featured two video-calling clients: Zoom and Webex. Yes, video-calling. Zoom and Webex use the E’s dashboard-mounted camera (pictured above), which features a wide-angle lens and points inward to the cabin, as well as the car’s standard 5G cellular network service, to facilitate meetings and calls while you’re in the car. Note that you can only use the apps while you’re in Park, limiting its use to when you’re spending time charging , for example. The video calling apps will likely need to be installed when you have your own car. The E-Class has its own app store where you can download the programs we’ve mentioned, plus plenty of others too. I’ve tested Zoom here – given its easy-to-use interface and quick invitation process – and I decided to video call my colleagues Tim Pollard and Tom Webster while I was on the launch of the E-Class to test out the tech properly From the off, it’s certainly beneficial to log into your existing Zoom account if you have one, and have it paired with your calendar in order to quickly join existing or already-planned meetings. We tried it without logging into an account and the joining process is a little clunkier, requiring email addresses to be typed out on-screen for a meeting invitation to then be sent out. With the meeting invitation sent, Zoom starts the call. It appears like you’re on the phone in your car with a green, upwardly angled phone handset icon while you’re in the meeting ‘room.’ Once your fellow meeting guests join, they pop up on screen just like any other video call. You can also use Zoom’s whiteboard function to draw things, and use emoji-like reactions via the toolbar. Naturally, though, the app is at the mercy of the data signal. It took several attempts to set up meetings, with weak signal at our call location causing the app to glitch and kick us out of meetings. Then there’s the (understandable) safety function of needing to be parked to use it. By that logic, you could just use your own phone, or use a laptop and a mobile hotspot. As with anything that needs data, you’re beholden to how strong your car’s cellular signal is. Our test was in a patchy area, leading to laggy calls When in a call, Zoom uses the dashboard-mounted camera to beam you into the digital world. We noticed the camera was very sensitive to direct sunlight, however. Just like the version of Zoom on your PC, tablet or phone, you can use controls to mute yourself or others, use a digital whiteboard, and invite other guests Sort of. The app is still in a beta phase ­– in its current state, it’s a little glitchy – and its reliance on cellular data can mean iffy video quality. When signal’s strong, it works like Zoom should.

565,Porsche’s 911 GT3 R Rennsport revealed at Rennsport Reunion,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/911-gt3-r-rennsport/,Ben Barry,2023-09-29,Car Magazine UK,"Porsche has unveiled a new track-only, limited-edition 911 at Rennsport Reunion – the Porsche motorsport celebration taking place at Laguna Seca, California from 28 September to 1 October 2023. Called 911 GT3 R Rennsport and limited to just 77 units worldwide, the new model is based on today’s 992-generation GT3 R racecar but – because it is designed only for track use rather than any race series – is unrestricted by FIA GT3 technical regulations. As such, the GT3 R Rennsport both succeeds the modern 935 and flips that car’s logic on its head, given its predecessor was based on the 991 GT2 RS road car but became a circuit-only special. The GT3 R Rennsport’s design is also less obviously in thrall to a retro racecar than the ‘Moby Dick’-inspired 935. Grant Larson and Thorsten Klein from Style Porsche designed the body, which embellishes the 911’s standard aluminium and steel bodyshell with new carbonfibre panels – only the bonnet and roof are said to be direct lifts from the GT3 R racecar. Notable features include aggressive cut-outs in wider wheel arches and vertical carbonfibre fins positioned directly behind each wheel, while the rear wing nods to the 1978 Daytona 24 Hours-winning Brumos Porsche 935/77, as driven by Peter Gregg, Toine Hezemans and Rolf Stommelen. (We’re presuming this is the hook for the 77-unit run). Wing mirrors are replaced by three cameras integrated into the bodywork, though drag and downforce figures are described as ‘largely untouched’ versus the racecar. Buyers can pick from seven ‘basic’ colours, but Porsche also offers three special colours – Rennsport Reunion Design, Speed Icon Design and the Flacht Design pictured, which both riffs on Porsche Martini liveries of old and makes a logical fit for a stars and stripes debut. Inside, the full FIA-spec rollcage leaves Porsche’s 2+2 reduced to a 1+0 single seater, and the remaining controls are similarly racey and far removed from even a GT3 RS – look no further than the bank of toggle switches in the centre console or a steering wheel that looks closer to an F1 yoke than any Porsche road car for evidence of that. Mechanicals are largely as per the racecar, if with some slight revisions. A 4.2-litre naturally aspirated flat six revs to an incendiary 9400rpm with total power of 612bhp ­– a substantial uplift over the racecar’s restricted 557bhp. There’s also a choice of three exhausts: the ultimate is unsilenced and de-catted, but Porsche offers two less noisy options with catalytic convertors. A constant-mesh sequential paddleshift gearbox similarly mirrors racecar specification, with ratios four, five and six matching those of the racer’s set-up for Daytona. Chassis highlights include KW five-way coilover suspension, AP Racing brakes and centre-lock 18-inch alloys, plus there’s a bespoke compound of Michelin tyre said to be more benign during their warm-up phase. There’s no word on other performance figures or lap times for now, but the GT3 R Rennsport’s weight is said to be slightly reduced at 1240kg and the top speed in sixth gear at 9000rpm is some 12mph higher than it racecar sibling. Naturally none of this exclusivity comes cheap – Porsche quotes €950,000 or $1,046,000. That’s hypercar or extremely special racecar money for what’s effectively a Porsche 911 racecar designed not to race, but the limited run means the GT3 R Rennsport is unlikely to hang around for long.

566,Nissan Hyper Urban Concept: an electric SUV from the future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/hyper-urban-concept/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-03,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Nissan Hyper Urban Concept, the company’s latest vision of a family-orientated, . Revealed digitally ahead of the later this month, Nissan says the new concept is aimed at ‘urban- and suburban-based professionals who prioritise environmental sustainability.’ The pictures released show a car that’s SUV-shaped but has all the hallmarks of a concept car. Nissan designers have sculpted an array of angular surfaces which all work to make the car a blend of sporty and dynamic, and those same surfaces mean the car’s appearance can drastically change depending on the light. Wide tyres also make the car look sporty, while introducing a more robust look. As you’d expect from a concept, the Hyper Urban also features scissors doors front and rear, helping to create a more open interior. Nissan says its designers were inspired by urban living spaces, and that translates to foldable front seats (when driving autonomously) and customizable displays. The result? A space that aims to be relaxing and engaging when needed. The Hyper Urban Concept is equipped with V2H functionality, as Nissan looks to interweave the EV with the home to an even greater degree. By acting as a spare battery for the house – in the same way as home batteries like the Tesla Powerwall – the Hyper Urban Concept could reduce in energy costs, whilst also reducing strain on the grid. The EV would also have an Intelligent Charging Management System, which wouldl use artificial intelligence to efficiently manage the power across both buildings and cars. Alongside power management, sustainability will also be key for family cars of the future – so the Hyper Urban Concept incorporates ‘lifespan extension’ ideas too. For example, hardware and software updates would be provided throughout the car’s life, while Nissan also envisages instrument panels that can be easily replaced and upgraded – ensuring the car remains cutting-edge years after its release. Earlier this year, President and CEO Makoto Uchida confirmed . Uchida also revealed that every new model from now on will be an electric vehicle. With that in mind, the car shown here could well make it into production in some form. Squint a bit, and the Hyper Urban concept looks like a mid-sized electric SUV that could slot below the Qashqai. Forget about the scissor doors and wacky interior, and you have the silhouette of another high-volume family car.

567,Torsten Müller-Ötvös retires as CEO of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/rolls-royce/torsten-muller-otvos/,Colin Overland,2023-10-05,Car Magazine UK,"The man who has led Rolls-Royce during a period of massive success is about to retire. Torsten Müller-Ötvös’ exit from the BMW luxury division’s Goodwood HQ ends a glittering career spanning more than 30 years within the group, during which time he also reinvented the Mini brand. Speaking to CAR, Müller-Ötvös said: ‘I’m getting 63 in November, and I’m already pretty old for BMW. It took me easily two years to start to understand what this business is all about. It’s not a car business, it’s a luxury business. It’s all about knowing the client and understanding the client. ‘I inherited a brand that was back to where the brand belongs, the pinnacle. When I joined, the task was now to rejuvenate, to get the brand down from the pedestal it was on at that time, to make it far more approachable, to open up into completely new target groups, to increase the female share massively, and turn the brand from a chauffeur’s car brand to the very cool lifestyle proposition it is now. ‘When you see how the demographics of our clients have changed, from when I joined 56 average age down to 43 now, 99 per cent male, now we are 15 per cent female – obviously more to come – but even more important the level of celebrities that are now part of the brand is nearly 30 per cent. This is quite something. It indicates that we hit the right tone in positioning the brand.’ The controversial Cullinan SUV was championed by Müller-Ötvös, who also oversaw the introduction of the more youth-focused Black Badge sub-brand and pushed the Bespoke and Coachbuild teams for hand-crafted and customised Rolls-Royces, and proudly led the development of the electric Spectre. ‘Black Badge helped a lot, Cullinan brought a unique lot of clients into the brand. It was heavily debated when we launched the Cullinan – “Are you guys crazy?” It’s now the most popular Rolls-Royce ever built.’ He added: ‘We have now formulated the strategy for the next 10 years, product strategy, some brand strategy, business strategy, so we know where we need to go. For that reason I think we can hand it over to a new pair of hands.’ That will be Chris Brownridge (pictured below), who was UK sales director for BMW before rising to the top job two years ago, and has also worked for Mini. Like Brownridge, Müller-Ötvös was also a long-serving BMW group executive when he got the Rolls job. His masterstroke was to stop thinking of Rolls-Royce as just a car maker and refocus it as a luxury brand. ‘I talked to a lot of private banks worldwide to better understand the demographics, the behaviours of ultra high net worth individuals, and they clearly indicated that to be wealthy would change massively over the course of the next years. To become wealthy in your life you don’t need any longer to invest in real estate or machinery, when you are bright enough you can even do it on your phone. We needed to create product that was befitting for younger people. There was also the clear learning that you need to get away from the “chauffeur” strategy – these people no longer want to sit in the back, they want to drive themselves. ‘That’s why we brought Wraith, Dawn, Cullinan – very much a family car, a relaxed, casual way to drive a Rolls-Royce. For many families Cullinan is the number one car now. Unthinkable years ago that a Rolls-Royce would become the number one car in the bigger garage.’ And it’s worked. ‘I don’t talk volume, but we came from 1000 cars [a year] when I joined and we are now at 6000. And what makes me even more proud is the price position. When I joined it was around 250,000 euros average price, it’s over half a million. That indicates also the power of the brand. ‘I’m also very proud that we brought Coachbuilt back to the brand. Something that was seen as technically not feasible when I joined – “Ah forget it, Torsten, it will never work.” ‘We also made it “allowed” to be seen in a Rolls-Royce. We tuned the brand in a way that is better approachable. It’s not unachievable or in a different league, but in such a way that we kept the high exclusivity of the brand, whilst making the brand more relaxed, more casual. ‘It sounds easy, but to convert an automotive brand into a highly regarded house of luxury and lxuury brand, this is quite something and I am extremely proud of it. It’s not only about how you do product, but far more about the ecosystem around the product. All these experiences we are offering our clients, the way we interact with them, the way we look after them is so different from when I came. It is a family. ‘This means attention to all details. How do we create events? What kind of service levels are we offereing? How do we look after them? Obviously we need to be pitch perfect when we deliver the product. We need to deliver excellent product. But it is buying an experience, and being part of a community. ‘I’m glad that I have a high-performance team on my side, people who are very different in their character, very different also in their capabilities and their personalities. I’m pretty outspoken, but I also expect from my people that they are tough with me. I’m not the wise man who knows everything. I depend on the knowledge that I have around the table. ‘For me it’s an honour to be at the helm of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. When I joined I felt a real burden on my shoulders. You’re suddenly responsible for one of the most well-known brands in the world. Then I read a couple of books about Sir Henry and Charles Rolls and that made me even more… nervous is the wrong word. But respectful. Because the ethos of Sir Henry resonates in my brain daily. This kind of “strive for perfection”. Perfection is not achieveable. It is a moving target. This is what we are doing.’ And what’s next for the Anglophile German? ‘I’ll probably go into non-executive director roles. But also taking a bit of me time, and re-starting interests I was always keen to do. I’m a passionate fly fisher but I haven’t done a lot over the course of the last years. I need a bit of mental engagement, some challenges on my hands. I love it.’ Colin is the managing editor of CAR magazine – and the man responsible for production and getting the words and pictures on to the page in an engaging, intelligent and high-quality fashion."
568,Nissan Hyper Adventure: an electric concept for the outdoors,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/hyper-adventure-concept/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-10,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan has revealed its second concept for the and as you’d expect it’s another . Get that surprise out the way, however, and the Nissan Hyper Adventure is a striking concept, designed to cope with the great outdoors. Here’s everything you need to know. Nissan says the Hyper Adventure is for ‘people passionate about outdoor adventures and and eco-friendly lifestyle.’ To that end, the Hyper Adventure is both designed to take on the outdoors, but also features technology designed to support an adventure in the elements. Key to the Hyper Adventure is V2X (vehicle to everything technology) which allow the car to act as an energy source or energy store when out in the wilderness. Within the umbrella of V2X, V2H (Vehicle to Home) tech would allow the SUV to power a camp or home. In the same way, the Nissan’s V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology, means it could help support the grid of a local community. Simply put, the Hyper Adventure can transform itself to a moving battery when needed. Of course, Hyper Adventure also needs to get around in demanding conditions, so it features Nissan’s electric e-4ORCE all-wheel-drive powertrain. The bodywork benefits from high ground clearance, and Nissan says the car can also achieve ‘high aerodynamic performance,’ which is quite optimistic for the low-speed off-roading this car would be doing. The Nissan offers space for a range of outdoor equipment such as tents or kayaks and there’s also a rear bench seat for extra space. The Hyper Adventure also gets retractable steps to help passengers get in and out when stopped on difficult terrain. But the most interest bit? The Hyper Adventure’s instrument panel connects to the bottom of the windscreen, making it easier to look at the road and visually bringing the outdoors in.

As you’d expect, the new iX2 is very closely related to including the platform and powertrain, as well as the interior. But that design? Bespoke (and, er, controversial) to the X2. The overall shape has taken quite a turn from the hatchback-on-stilts look of , with lots of blocky details and impactful lines. The iX2 features a blanked-off grille with a diamond motif similar to that seen on the iX and blue detailing in its headlights in order to (only very subtly) differentiate it from the combustion-powered X2. The interior is largely unchanged from the X1, which includes a smaller version of BMW’s curved display and a high centre console that does without the brand’s iDrive click-wheel controller – BMW insiders say the screen is much closer to the driver than in other cars that its inclusion doesn’t seem as warranted. Here, though, the iX2 uses BMW Operating System 9 – the latest software technology from the brand, which is even newer than what you get on . OS9 introduces a new home screen that always has the navigation map displayed and promotes swifter integration with your phone via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The iX2 is only available in M Sport trim and, as for performance, one variant of the iX2 has been announced so far: the eDrive30. That model includes a single 308bhp e-motor driving the front wheels, and includes a hot hatch-baiting 0-62mph sprint time of 5.6 seconds. BMW also claims a maximum range of 266 miles.

As well as a combustion engine X2, BMW also revealed at the same time. All X2 models are in M Sport trim ( , meanwhile, includes lower-spec Sport and xLine variants), which means large sporty alloys, an aggressive bodykit and sports suspension.

571,New Mazda MX-5 concept confirmed for world debut this month,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/mx-5/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-11,Car Magazine UK,"An important new Mazda MX-5 concept has been confirmed for this month’s , the successor to what used to be called the Tokyo motor show. Mazda is remaining tightlipped about the details but has issued this shadowy teaser photograph of the next roadster, to be shown in concept car guise.

Insiders have revealed to CAR that an electric powertrain is the obvious next step to keep the world’s best-selling roadster alive in a carbon-crunched zeitgeist. Mazda has also confirmed an ‘upgrade’ to the current MX-5, although no details are provided yet. It will be shown alongside a 1989 original Mk1 and an MX-5 SeDV that can be driven by disabled people using only their hands. The MX-5 (current model, above) has now gone on to sell comfortably over a million copies globally since launch 34 years ago. It’s encouraging news that the company continues to develop it. Stay tuned for more news on the new Mazda MX-5. We’ll be updating this page in the run-up to the Japan Mobility Show.

572,"Lexus LBX baby crossover priced from £29,995",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lexus/lbx/,Tim Pollard,2023-10-13,Car Magazine UK,"The new Lexus LBX will be priced from £29,995 in the UK when first deliveries get underway in the spring. All models at launch will be front-wheel drive and Brits can pick from nine different trim levels, stretching all the way up to £40,545 Takumi Design range-topper. It’s a baby crossover to stretch the Lexus range down in to the compact SUV marketplace. It’s significant in many ways, not least for its higher volume aspirations, the smallest footprint of any Lexus in history, a new badge and its fresh design, ushering in a distinctive face post-spindle grille. LBX is designed and engineered primarily for the European market, says Lexus, although the will likely be sold in other continents, too. Based around the Toyota group’s GA-B global platform like its sibling, the Lexus LBX comes with the 1.5-litre hybrid powertrain featuring the latest, more powerful bi-polar nickel-metal hydride batteries for greater range and energy density. The LBX is 4190mm long and 1825mm wide, almost precisely shadowing the popular . It’s slap-bang in the middle of the small SUV segment, where it’ll compete with the likes of the VW T-Cross, Volvo XC40 and Mazda CX-30. The compact crossover is most noteworthy for its new grille treatment; after a decade of large ‘spindle’ design grilles that dominated the noses of most Lexus cars, the LBX adopts a new, pared-back look. Koichi Suga, general manager Lexus Design, said: ‘We have “deconstructed” the spindle grille to make way for a new frontal design. We’ve succeeded in creating a new face identity that’s completely different from before yet is instantly recognisable as a Lexus.’ Slimline headlamps are co-joined by a narrow aperture running the width of the bonnet, shrinking the trapezoidal grille to a smaller opening below the metal badge on the leading edge of the bonnet. The grille is more modestly sized, its honeycomb pattern repeated on the body coloured front bumper area. Europe was the lead global region for the development of the LBX – for the first time ever on a Lexus. ‘This influence will help the LBX become one of the best-sellers for the brand in Europe,’ the firm vows. There’s the familiar three-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol engine that operates on the Atkinson cycle, matched to the Toyota group’s self-charging hybrid tech. Total system power output is rated at 134bhp and 137lb ft and wheel sizes are 17in or 18in. Drive is sent to the front wheels as standard, but higher-spec models will eventually come with Lexus’s E-Four all-wheel drive adding an electric motor at the rear axle, enabling traction at both ends. No performance figures are yet available, but the identically powered Yaris Cross manages 0-62mph in 11.2sec, 105mph all out, 65.9mpg combined fuel economy and 120g/km of CO2. We’d expect similar figures for the Lexus LBX. The LBX has seating for four and a cabin spruced up to meet the brand’s luxury ambitions. The Lexus Link Connect system is standard, operated via a 9.8-inch touchscreen. Lexus has made significant advances in infotainment in recent years and you can now talk to your car using ‘Hey Lexus’ speech recognition. As is the brand’s tradition, audiophiles can also specify a very top-end Mark Levinson 13-speaker stereo. The Lexus LBX is a modestly sized crossover, but loadspace is rated at 332 litres for front-wheel drive models; that figure dips an unspecified amount for all-wheel drive E-Four models. The first customer deliveries aren’t scheduled until March 2024, eight months after it was unveiled. LBX marks a new naming convention for the brand; only the LFA has enjoyed three letters before. Lexus says it stands for Lexus Breakthrough Crossover, but an alternative reading has L for Lexus, B points to the B-segment market (so Ford Puma, Vauxhall Mokka etc) and X again implies it’s an SUV/crossover, as is the industry norm. It’s a market segment Lexus currently isn’t in, and is likely attracted to joining given the prevalence and success of compact crossovers. It’ll also likely aid in recapturing some of the customers it had with the on sale until a few years ago.

573,Nissan’s Hyper Tourer is a self-driving people-mover for the future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/hyper-tourer/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-17,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan has revealed another concept ahead of the , and this time it’s not an electric SUV, but a people mover. Called the Hyper Tourer, the futuristic minivan is the third concept to be revealed by the Japanese brand and focuses on ‘nurturing and reinforcing the bond between people as they journey together.’ Keep reading for everything else you need to know about the Nissan Hyper Tourer concept. Rather than show us another compact, electric SUV, Nissan has shown us a striking looling minivan. Finished in a fetching bronze colour, it’s substantial looking – a clue as to the huge amount of cabin space inside – but also looks relatively aerodynamic. Simply put, it may be the shape of a brick, but it’s a sporty brick at least. Nissan says the car’s exterior has been shaped to represent Japanese beauty and aerodynamic performance, but to our eyes it references Nissan’s premium competition more – namely Lexus. Take another look at that spindle shaped grille and the rear of the car; isn’t that everything we’d expect from Toyota’s premium brand? The Hyper Tourer may look great, but like any minivan the clever stuff is on the inside, not the outside. To that end, the Hyper Tourer uses e-4orce and Nissan’s EV Technology vision, which is an annoying way of saying it’s got an all-wheel drive electric powertrain with solid-state batteries. By opting for Nissan’s forthcoming high energy-density tech, the Hyper Tourer can have an even more spacious cabin, and an extremely low CoG. There’s also space to feature screens on the cabin floor and ceiling, which Nissan says will display footage of riverbeds and skies… The Hyper Tourer also uses autonomous technology, which means that all occupants can talk to each other – in theory. The front seats can swivel 360-degrees, while those at the rear can wear headsets that mirror the navigation and audio controls. Nissan says the Hyper tourer will also utilise biometric monitoring, so it’ll analyse the key vitals of passengers such as heart rate, breathing and brainwaves – and change the music and lighting accordingly.

574,New Citroen e-C3 vies to be the UK’s cheapest electric car in 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/citroen/e-c3/,Jake Groves,2023-10-17,Car Magazine UK,"The race to create cheaper electric cars is heating up with this, the new Citroen e-C3. The battery-electric supermini has been revealed in Paris and intends to rewrite the rulebook on how much European-built electric cars should cost. Citroen says its new e-C3 is ‘the first European affordable electric car.’ The word ‘European’ is the key caveat because the Dacia is cheaper and already on sale in Europe – but it’s Chinese-made. The Spring will launch in the UK in 2024. The new e-C3 will cost from around £23,000 and it will compete with other lower cost rivals such as the upcoming and . Inevitably the new hatch has a touch of the crossover SUV about its stance, but this is not the replacement for the : that will come next. Some of the e-C3’s design details have been inspired by , and the overall look of the car includes many more angular and clean-cut lines than Citroens of the past. That’s something that Citroen design director, Pierre Leclerq, has been working on this past year, with the more aggressive look starting off with the facelifted C5 Aircross. ‘Think more consumer electronics with how we’ll treat things like headlights and grilles going forward. This is the start of something that we’re going to continue to explore in every car that I really believe will give us much more chances to be successful in terms of sales – making everything round is extremely difficult to make a success,’ he told CAR in early 2023. On top of that, the new e-C3 is the first car to launch with Citroen’s new (and yet rather old-school) logo. The brand’s return to the oval badging with the two chevrons housed inside apes that of Citroen’s branding over many decades of its more than 100-year-long history. ‘We tried it first on , and we thought it looked pretty cool and would try it out on projects we were working on in the studio,’ Leclercq told us in early 2023. ‘I wouldn’t say everyone was convinced – we had to work on the proportions and, while it might look like the original logo from 1919, we actually did a lot of work to fine tune it.’ By being smart with materials, technology and engineering. The most obvious strategy is its shape; the new e-C3 is based on the ‘Smart Car’ (no, not that Smart) platform being deployed by Stellantis in markets like India and South America. In fact, the new e-C3 shares a lot of componentry with the ‘CC21’ C3 (which is much boxier and crossover-ier than the outgoing Euro-spec C3) available in those markets. Naturally, though, the biggest expense of an EV is the battery pack. Here, the new e-C3 uses a lithium ferro phosphate battery pack instead of a more traditional lithium ion one, which uses far fewer rare earths like cobalt or manganese, making it cheaper and less reliant on the rather iffy supply chain of those materials. The battery pack is rated to 44kWh here, and Citroen claims a 199-mile electric range for this model. The brand says the e-C3 is also capable of 100kW DC charging, allowing a 20-80 per cent charge to be done in 26 minutes. Sadly, unlike the Oli concept, the e-C3’s charging point is placed in a rather conventional place rather than neatly behind the badge. As well as the info about the battery pack, Citroen has confirmed some performance data. The new e-C3 is powered by a single 111bhp electric motor driving the front wheels, which is good for a 0-62mph time of around 11 seconds and a top speed of 84mph. As for any bonus engineering, Citroen says it’s included some of its Advanced Comfort features in the new e-C3. As well as super-squishy seats, the suspension features the brand’s Progressive Hydraulic Cushions normally only seen on the brand’s larger cars. Full of clever cost-saving measures in here, too – without looking too cheap and tacky. Citroen calls the e-C3’s interior the C-Zen Lounge (ugh…) and it features some interesting details. First of which is the ‘Citroen Head-Up Display’, which isn’t technically the kind of HUD we’ve come to know (i.e.: a digital image reflected onto the inside of the windscreen). Instead, the drivers’ instruments are positioned at the very top of the dashboard and inset into it; driving data like your speed and the state of charge are displayed there, with little else to distract you. It arguably reminds us of the high-set dot-matrix displays of the mid-2000s Xsara Picasso and C4 hatchback. Other simple details include some handy cupholders in the centre console, physical climate control switchgear low down in the dashboard and some soft materials used. As mentioned, Citroen plans to launch the new e-C3 in the first few months of 2024 priced from under £23,000 in its entry-level model, and is expected to launch in the UK in August 2024. More detailed UK pricing information will be revealed closer to its launch. Citroen also makes a point of introducing only three trim levels to simplify the range offered: entry-level You!, mid-tier Plus and top-spec Max. You! models feature the brand’s Advance Comfort suspension, auto headlights, rear parking sensors, manual air con and six airbags. This model also does without a central infotainment display; instead, Citroen supplies you a docking point for your phone. Plus includes 17-inch alloys, a 10.25-inch central infotainment display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Advance Comfort seats, auto wipers, split-fold rear seats and the option of two-tone paint. Max, meanwhile, tops the e-C3 spec off with LED rear lights, tinted rear glass, automatic air con, navigation, a wireless charging pad, rear parking camera and rear electric windows. Citroen has also confirmed that a second e-C3 variant is due in 2025 with a smaller 124-mile range will launch in 2025. This model is unconfirmed for the UK market, but Citroen says it’ll arrive in Continental Europe with a list price starting at €19,900.

583,Lexus LF-ZL concept: a luxury flagship of the future,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lexus/lf-zl/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"Lexus has revealed two concepts at this year’s Tokyo mobility show; a low-slug saloon concept called the LF-ZC, and this the LF-ZL. Unlike the , Lexus hasn’t revealed any firm production plans for the LF-ZL, but it does point to a future for Toyota’s premium brand. Lexus LF-ZL is short for ‘Lexus Future Zero-emission Luxury,’ as this concept is more focused on passenger comfort than the more dynamic LF-ZC. The LF-ZL is more of a crossover or SUV too, and is designed to fit into a more connected future. As you’d expect, the LF-ZL focuses on personalised customer interaction and wants to make the entire driving experience pleasant rather than particularly quick. Just like the LF-ZC, the LF-ZL showcases an evolved, more extreme of Lexus’ existing design language. Featuring the brand’s love it or loathe it spindle shape flanked by a suitably pointy light signature, the LF-ZL is a crossover laden with Lexus’ usual combination of dynamic folds and creases. Because this car is about the passenger experience as well as the drivers’ you’ll find doors that open forward and backward. There are no B-pillars either, making ingress and egress that bit easier. The rear of the car features horizontal and vertical lighting, but interestingly there’s no rear window; the LF-ZL relies on sensors – and presumably a rear camera – for a view out the back. The LF-ZL benefits from the extra cabin space that an EV powertrain brings – and it’s amplified by a huge, swooping greenhouse. There’s ample legroom for rear passengers, and a glass roof ensures the cabin is as light and airy as possible. Like the LF-ZC concept, the LF-ZL will also use Lexus in-house Arene OS – though here it’s supercharged for a further leap into the future. Lexus imagines a system that’s able to monitor and respond to the drivers’ needs whilst also interacting with other services using V2X technology. What’s more, an augmented reality feature called ‘Interactive Reality in Motion’ would enable the driver to quickly find out about landmarks and other POIs simply by pointing. Presumably, you’d be using the car’s autonomous technology when sightseeing, though. AI tech is included in Arene too. It’ll use an advanced voice assistant to give information and suggest alternative routes and activities. Sustainability is already a key aspect of vehicle production, and the Lexus LF-ZL aims to make things even more eco-friendly. The future flagship aims to present an ‘innately sustainable, guilt-free luxury lifestyle that empowers customers to live in tune with their needs and desires while at the same time contributing positively to the environment and society at large.’ With that in mind, Lexus’ interior designers have chosen bamboo to demonstrate the LF-ZL’s sustainable credentials. Thanks to fast growth, a strong ability to absorb carbon dioxide and its decorative options, bamboo is the flagship material in the LF-ZL’s interior – and could well take the place of chrome or wood in future EVs.

584,Hyundai Ioniq 5 N: electric hot hatch costs £65k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/ioniq-5-n/,Piers Ward,2023-10-26,Car Magazine UK,"Say hello to the saviour of the hot hatch, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Or at least that’s what the Korean firm will be hoping for with its first foray into an electric version of the ‘N’ performance brand. Due for UK deliveries in 2024, the Ioniq 5 N features the sort of BMW M3-smashing performance we’ve come to expect of a cooking electric car (twin electric motors giving 641bhp and 568lb ft in the awkwardly titled N Grin Boost mode; 0-62mph in just 3.4 seconds) but this time wrapped up in a package that should also deliver on handling appeal. Hyundai is at pains to stress the efforts it has gone to in order to ensure the Ioniq 5 N delivers on the N promise of being both fast and great to drive. The company is well aware of the halo effect N has had up to now on its brand perception and doesn’t want to blow it with a poor offering here. To that end, the car is 20mm lower (Tyrone Johnson, head of vehicle test and development, wanted more: ‘the car is not as low as we’d like, but we have to keep a reasonable ground clearance’), 80mm longer and, importantly, 50mm wider. The chassis has been stiffened with additional welding and adhesives, and the 5 N also gets unique front and rear subframes. Even the battery and motor mountings have been stiffened, while extra feedback is promised through the all-new steering tune. Larger brakes (400:360mm, f:r) are fitted and the regen system is capable of generating 0.6g. 21-inch wheels on 275/35 Pirelli P-Zero tyres are standard. As befits the hot version, the body has been worked over. Hyundai claims the rear spoiler and diffusor generate downforce and don’t merely reduce lift, while the front has plenty of air scoops and vents. Overall, it’s aggressive enough to mark it out without being too in-your-face – the large rear spoiler can almost look subtle from some angles. The matt blue paint is unique to this car. Heat is the big issue. We got a sneak preview of the car ahead of Goodwood and Thomas Buerkle, head of design at Hyundai Europe, stressed how much work his design team had done on getting enough air circulating around the batteries so they don’t overheat on a hot lap: ‘Every element of the design is both form and function.’ There are air curtains galore at the front, including a neat looking set of vertical slats, which add to the aggressive looks but also throw air where it’s needed. Inside, the car gets figure-hugging seats in either cloth/leather or Alcantara/leather that are mounted lower, while the steering wheel is smaller, thicker-rimmed and with a more aggressive centre boss. It also gains two ‘N’ mode buttons that are configurable and additional knee pads on the centre console, because all that g has to be braced against somehow. Much as with all hot hatches of the past, it’s enough to make the interior feel more performance-oriented than the normal car. Software changes are arguably even more crucial. Hyundai has created N e-shift that mimics an eight-speed gearbox by pausing the torque delivery and interrupting the artificial sound. There’s even a fake rev counter in the dash. That’s not the only ‘N’ promise: N Pedal promises to make the car ‘tuck’ into a corner more (the holy grail of ICE hot hatches and not something anyone has achieved so far with an EV); N Grin Boost gives a temporary burst of power for 10 seconds (those headline figures above drop back to 601bhp and 546lb ft in normal running); N Drift Optimiser does what it says on the tin with an integrated Torque Kick Drift function; N Torque Distribution shuffles torque around, helped by the electronic limited slip diff at the rear; N Launch Control is another obvious one. Despite all this, weight will be the big issue. Hyundai hasn’t confirmed the figures yet, but even the standard car comes in at around two tonnes. A Peugeot 106 Rallye it is not. To be fair, Johnson doesn’t shirk from the issue, but acknowledges they’ve tried to address it: ‘You’re not going to get the impression it’s a 1000kg car, but you would never think it’s a much higher weight car. It’s a fast five door hatchback and that’s the sense you get.’ The official WLTP range isn’t confirmed at this stage, but with a larger 84kWh battery (up from 77kWh in the base car), it should hit 300 miles with a gentle right foot. Hyundai claims it can do two laps of the Nurburgring in one hit, which doesn’t sound like much but represents quite a feat for an electric car because of the heat build-up in the batteries. With electric hot hatches proving rare so far, it’s a brave move from Hyundai. As Till Wartenberg, vice president of N brand, tells CAR: ‘I think the time has come where Hyundai can not only be a challenger anymore, but maybe leading the segment and create something new.’ Hot hatches traditionally combined the holy grail of performance for normal motorists: pace, handling, affordability. Up until now, electric performance cars have occasionally managed to combine the first two (hello, Porsche Taycan), but not so much of the latter (hello, any ludicrous 2000hp + hypercar). Wartenberg acknowledges that value is still important, as ‘N should still be accessible and a reasonable price. But of course it will be more than the ICE car.’ And that price is £65,000 in the UK, pushing it a few grand above its Kia EV6 GT compatriot.

A veteran of CAR magazine, Autocar, Top Gear and Auto Express, Piers has probably driven it, written it and reviewed it before most."

The new Hyper Punk concept is meant to be a ‘mobile creative studio’ on wheels, and Nissan describes it as ‘an all-electric compact crossover tailored for content creators, influencers, artists and those who embrace style and innovation.’ Its exterior design is awash with sharp creases and polygonal angles, and includes clever uses of light like wraparound DRLs and even strips of glowing white in the massive 23-inch wheels. The interior is heavily inspired by origami, with layered triangles folding over each other in the dashboard and there are headrest speakers from Fender installed. Nissan says the Hyper Punk concept includes V2X technology, and the interior’s ‘seamless internet connectivity’ allows the user to ‘link their devices and creative equipment, enabling users to access information or create on the go.’ Given the quietly-growing prevalence of the metaverse, Nissan is keen to show that its concept can work in the physical as well as the digital world.

576,TT at 25: Audi’s iconic sports car bows out,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/tt/,Jake Groves,2023-10-19,Car Magazine UK,"One of Audi’s most iconic models, the TT, is retiring. Ingolstadt’s design-forward sports car comes to the end of its life this year, its 25 anniversary. ‘We’re still basking in its afterglow,’ says Audi UK director, Andrew Doyle. ‘It was one of the key catalysts behind the incredible transformation our brand has undergone over the past quarter of a century, and in this special anniversary year its history and legacy richly deserve celebration.’ In fact, the TT’s 25 anniversary and subsequent retirement had been celebrated with the Iconic Edition – an end-of-the-line variant for the sports coupe and convertible meant to mark its end. An original Mk1, as well as a TT RS Iconic Edition Coupe and Roadster, has been out for one last photoshoot at the very location that gave the car its name: the roads of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. The TT’s story actually started three year’s earlier with the TT Coupe design study (pictured above), which made its public debut at the 1995 Frankfurt motor show. The mid-90s was a time when Audi was trying to modernise itself, introducing a new naming structure and a new design language. But the TT concept’s aim was to push the envelope, designed to show how Audi could be truly radical – rather than just modern. Little changed between concept and Mk1 production car – save for rear side windows – and the TT was quickly considered to be a design masterstroke of the new millennium. Its launch propelled Audi from a maker of clean-if-plain premium executive cars and all-wheel drive weapons to one that’s capable of truly interesting and fashionable sports cars, too. It was also proof that interesting things could come from humble beginnings. The Mk1 TT shared a lot with the rather dowdy Mk4 VW Golf, and yet the two look and feel worlds apart. But such design freedom didn’t entirely mean an easy developmental ride; early Mk1 TTs, sans spoiler as originally intended, made the headlines after some high-speed crashes implied a lack of stability. The car was recalled, with an electronic stability control being applied, as well as a spoiler which, frankly, did more than spoil the air. The TT carried on for two more generations, modernising and refreshing the formula. Some in the automotive community say the original TT will always be the best one, with later models not quite giving the same excitement and quirkiness. While the TT has matured, grown more sensible and tried to keep up with the times over its later generations, Audi has consciously been trying to reinvent the wheel. There have been attempts and new theories put forward, including the TT offroad concept that was designed to take advantage of the SUV craze, or the TT Sportback concept which aimed to make the two-door coupe more usable. Neither got beyond the concept stage, but it means the TT won’t survive the electrification era we’re witnessing unfold in front of us. ‘TT was and always will be a part of our DNA,’ Marc Lichte, head of Audi design, tells CAR. Regarding the future of the model, Lichte adds: ‘we have many ideas of what could happen, but officially, nothing has been decided.’ Instead, Lichte says he wants design elements of the TT to remain part of Audi’s future portfolio. The ActiveSphere concept, revealed in 2023, features coupe-like roof pillars similar to the TT. For now, though, we’ll have to accept that the TT’s life has come to an end. The small coupe shook up Audi as a brand and told the world it could make truly stylish and forward-thinking cars. Rest in peace, TT.

577,Suzuki’s Corolla: Toyota-based Suzuki Swace revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/suzuki/swace/,Murray Scullion,2023-10-21,Car Magazine UK,"Low emissions, strong economy, and bargain prices. These are the titbits Suzuki is offering up in order to entice new buyers to this, the new Suzuki Swace. In case you couldn’t tell, it’s a reskinned and is set to come to the UK later this year. That car is already on our list of the , so it’s no surprise this is too. It’s the second car to come from Suzuki and Toyota’s new partnership – the first being the Suzuki Across, a RAV4 wearing a Suzuki badge. What are the differences between the Swace and Corolla? Well the Swace has a restyled radiator grille, new LED headlamps, and tweaked front and rear bumpers. Inside, the Swace is treated to some new leather upholstery, but apart from that it’s the same as the Corolla. This means buyers get an eight-inch infotainment screen with / , air con, and heated seats. Like all new Suzukis, the Swace is a hybrid. It’s the same 1.8-litre petrol engine/battery/CVT combo as the Corolla. 0-62mph is dealt with in 11.1seconds, although power output is yet to be confirmed. Emissions are stated at 99g/km on the WLTP cycle. There’s an EV mode too. Press the button and the Suzuki will be able to cover ground producing zero emissions for ‘short distances’. The Corolla is offered with a more powerful 2.0-litre engine too, but Suzuki isn’t saying if it’ll come to the Swace. The raison d’etre of this car is the fact that it’ll be a cheaper Toyota Corolla Touring. Prices haven’t been revealed yet, although we anticipate the Swace will start from around £25,000. No words as to whether it’ll be included in Suzuki’s 0% APR deals. Buyers should be aware that at time of writing, the Toyota Corolla Touring is available with no interest to pay. The Swace will appeal to price-conscious estate buyers who don’t give a damn about badges and fleet managers. After all, fleet buyers are concerned about pricing, emissions, and size, and the Swace scores well on all of these fronts."
578,SP-8: Ferrari's latest one-off revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/sf-8/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-24,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Ferrari SP-8, the latest one-off production from Maranello’s bespoke Special Projects programme. Designed by the Flavio Manzoni-headed Ferrari Styling Centre, it’s an open-topped two-seater an uses a F8 Spider as a base – but then takes things a more extreme, distinct route. It was commissioned by one of Ferrari’s current based in Taiwan, but it’ll get a physical debut at Ferrari’s Finali Mondiali 2023 event later this week. The SP-8 uses the chassis, engine and other gubbins of the F8 Spider – but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. As a result, the SP-8 is powered by Maranello’s awarding-winning 3.9-litre V8 twin-turbo. Most of the time here has been spent on the SP-8’s bespoke design. Although the SP-8 sits on an F8 chassis, it looks very different. Ferrari says the ethos of the new car ‘centres around the way in which its volumes crossover and fuse into one another.’ Look at the sketch below, and you’ll see Maranello originally envisaged an extremely futuristic vehicle. Just look at that wraparound windscreen! Still, the essence of those designs is carried over into the finished car. To that end, the entire SP-8 is two-tone; with the front of the car finished in unpainted carbonfibre and the rear painted in silver. Ferrari’s designers have used the two-tone effect to make the rear of the car almost emerge out of the front, creating a dynamic but also classic look. CFD tools have also been employed to ensure the SF-8 doesn’t just look good – but cuts through the air as efficiently as the F8 Spider on which it’s based. The front of the car – while similar to the F8 – is also completely different to the standard car, with Ferrari engineers using a 3D-printed cast to create its unique shape. Unique five-spoke rims complete the look, but not everything on the SP-8 is a one-off: the rear lights are taken from the Roma but different lenses, while the windscreen and the tailpipes have the same treatment as the 296 GTB.

579,Nissan’s Hyper Force concept will be the next GT-R – eventually,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/hyper-force/,Ben Miller,2023-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"The GT-R is Nissan’s Porsche 911: an icon of performance and design and a one-car distillation of all that the marque stands for, or at least strives to stand for. And so, in its 90 birthday year, Nissan’s created the Hyper Force concept. It’s not a new GT-R, sadly. But it is a pretty comprehensive set of next GT-R clues hidden within a striking concept car. It was revealed at the earlier today. Created with input from Polyphony Digital, the outfit behind the franchise with which the GT-R is synonymous, the Hyper Force concept is a battery-electric, all-wheel drive powerhouse toting an at this point entirely fictional 1000kW, or 1341bhp. Reliant on mass-produced solid-state battery technology (which won’t be with us until circa 2028, Nissan reckons), the Hyper Force stays true to the GT-R bloodline with flattering, user-friendly dynamics, a 2+2 layout and styling that ticks all the iconic GT-R boxes, particularly in the front and rear light signatures. The body itself is low, purposeful and recognisably GT-R despite a very zeitgeisty blend of curves and crisp-edged geometry. Nissan design’s Giovanny Arroba: ‘Imagine a chiselled blade that cuts through the air, rather than bowing down, subservient to it.’ As with previous GT-Rs, high-performance four-wheel drive will let mortals tap its 1340bhp without turning the car into a pile of shattered carbon, only this time it’ll be carefully controlled e-motors doing the work, rather than a fiendishly complex mechanical drivetrain. ‘The four-wheel drive system is what makes the GT-R behave like no other sports car; it’s easier to drive and more forgiving,’ explains Nissan product planning’s Ivan Espinosa. ‘It helps you to be quicker and feel more in control of a car. It’s very predictable. With electric technology it’s easy to replicate that – it comes with a lot of tuning, a lot of detail work the same as we did years ago with the GT-R system but in a different way. It’s now software-driven; how you can control the different elements of the motors and braking and the chassis set-up. It’s interesting because it’s something we haven’t done before. It’s a discovery journey, you know, having a chassis engineer talking to the software engineer. It’s a bit of a clash but it’s working, and we’re starting to see the results.’ Huge downforce and active aero play their part on the Hyper Force, too, as does the ability to cut laps virtually while the car’s charging ahead of your next actual track session, the by-wire steering and immersive cockpit displays temporarily making a sim of your supercar. Then, when you do head out, the virtual and the physical might blur, the head-up display helping you optimise your lines and braking points. Espinosa: ‘The GT-R is a driver’s car. The point is not to have the car drive for you. But you could imagine it helping you drive, right, improving your lap times? It would be really boring if the car just took control, but maybe it does this for one lap, so you get to see what the optimum lap looks like. The idea is really to help the driver become a better driver.’ While much about the Hyper Force looks production-feasible, even elements of its outlandish interior, the script on its flanks are a clue as to the technology Nissan considers key to the car’s production timeline – solid-state batteries. ‘It all pivots around the use of all solid-state batteries,’ confirms Espinosa. The technology, which promises to drastically crank up cell power density, is key to delivering on Nissan’s performance ambitions for the next GT-R. ‘It’s not so much about long range,’ explains Espinosa. ‘Imagine a trackday. You want a battery that allows you to do an out lap, a couple of hot laps [at a long circuit like the ’Ring] and an in lap. Then you charge the car and in 20 minutes you’re ready to do it again. This is what we’re thinking. That’s the kind of reverse planning we’re looking at to define the size of the battery. It’s really not about driving hundreds of miles. Perhaps in future Nissans you’ll have an everyday car with a larger battery and then you have a NISMO version which is really track oriented, so you can minimise the battery and the weight and maximise the performance.’ If previous GT-Rs democratised outlandish performance in the sense that they made it accessible, they also made it almost affordable. Traditionally a performance bargain, can that possibly persist as the GT-R goes electric? ‘Probably the most difficult element of all is the affordability,’ says Espinosa. ‘This is what’s making this journey difficult, because today there’s the technology to make an electric supercar. But all these EV supercars are half a million dollars or more. So, we are working on finding the right moment, when the technology hits the right price point, so we can push it out and make an incredible GT-R. We don’t want it to be a super-exclusive car.’ As editor, Ben leads CAR magazine and its content strategy. One of the team who's just as happy on two wheels as four."
580,Iconic SP: Mazda’s hydrogen-powered sports EV concept is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/iconic-sp/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"What will the compact sports car look like in the ? For Mazda, it could look like this; the Iconic SP. Unveiled at the earlier today – alongside the latest MX-5 – the Iconic SP is ‘a compact sports car concept designed to adapt to a new era.’ It underlines Mazda’s commitment to the fizzy sports car, regardless of what’s under the bonnet. Mazda’s design office is on an epic run, and the Iconic SP continues the trend. It’s an electric car underneath, but it’s been penned as classic junior sports car – just like the original MX-5. Clean and flowing lines keep things classy and timeless – and even the interior is relatively basic. And unlike most electric concepts, the Iconic SP doesn’t suffer from the usual smattering of bright blue streaks – this car is electric, but that’s not the reason for its existence. Mazda says the Iconic SP will put out 374bhp, but its low weight (for an EV) of 1450kg promises to salvage the dynamism and agility the MX-5 has come to signify. Interestingly, Mazda says it’ll be powered by a dual rotary power generator EV powertrain – which is a long way of saying it’ll use a range extender. However, unlike the rotary range extender in the MX-30 R-EV, Mazda says the powertrain in this car could be adapted to burn a variety of fuels, including hydrogen and possibly e-Fuels. The Iconic SP will be mid-engined: although it’ll use a battery electric motor, its rotary engine will be packaged in the centre of the car for performance reasons. ‘We love the MX-5, and the world loves the MX-5,’ said Mazda President and CEO, Masahiro Moro. ‘We are determined in the age of electrification to keep the joy of driving which the MX-5 represents alive, and the Mazda Iconic SP, with its dual rotary power generator EV powertrain is our dream solution. A dream we will work hard to launch. Mazda will always deliver vehicles that remind people that cars are pure joy and an indispensable part of their lives.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

581,Lexus LF-ZC: electric sports saloon heading to production in 2026,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lexus/lf-zc/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-25,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Lexus LF-ZC, a preview of a new, electric production car that’ll be on the road by 2026. Revealed at the today, the new EV contains cutting-edge tech Lexus hopes to put into full-scale production, but wraps it up in a low-slung, high-performance package. Lexus calls this design theme ‘Provocative Simplicity’ but that’s basically marketing-speak for Lexus 2.0. It may look futuristic, but there are several design touches that ensure the LF-ZC looks like something from Toyota’s premium brand. The spindle grille remains at the front, though now it’s more of a ‘spindle-shape area,’ and like all other Lexus cars, it’s flanked by the brand’s familiar arrow-shaped headlights – which are even pointier here. At the rear Lexus’ designers have continued the pointy theme, opting for a chunky bumper and a combination of horizontal and rear lights. Will this exact design make it to the production car? Almost certainly not, but it’s still got the potential to be the most interesting-looking Lexus since the LC. It’s also incredibly slippery; Lexus is targeting a Cd of 0.2, which will help the range. The LF-ZC’s swooping greenhouse makes for a huge interior – and as you’d expect it’s covered in tech. The driver uses a more advanced version of Lexus’ steer-by-wire tech and a small cockpit screen, while the passenger benefits from two touchscreens. The idea here is driver focus; the LF-ZC’s low CoG and four-wheel drive system hints at a car you’ll want to divert all of your attention to. When you don’t want to drive, the LF-ZC’s cutting-edge ADAs systems can be accessed via a pad on the left of the yolk, while infotainment functions are accessible on the right. The interior will run Arene OS, a Lexus-designed operating system designed to keep the LF-ZC at the forefront of safety and infotainment tech. In time, Lexus says it’ll also help you improve your driving. The Arene OS makes Lexus the latest brand to try and create its own, in-house operating system, and follows Mercedes’ Lexus says its forthcoming BEVs will be more modular than before, thanks to a gigacasting process. By putting battery tech in the middle, Lexus believes it’ll be easier to produce and manufacture new designs, making future development more agile. What’s more, Lexus’ upcoming EVs will also autonomously drive themselves through the production line using their electric motors and basic sensors. This manufacturing ‘drive-thru’ technology will speed up production and reduce the need for extra equipment.

586,Toyota’s FT-Se concept revealed in Tokyo,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/ft-se/,Jake Groves,2023-10-26,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota has revealed the FT-Se concept – a dinky, two-seat electric sports car concept. The show car was unveiled at the (formerly known as the Tokyo motor show). According to the brand, the concept is designed as ‘a high-performance sports BEV model proposed as one of the options for sports cars in the carbon-neutral era.’ The FT-Se has been designed using expertise from the brand’s Gazoo Racing division, and its diminutive size implies dimensions similar to both the and MR-2. The FT-Se goes hard on its aerodynamics, with a super-sharp look outside. The cosy interior is kept simple with a yoke-like steering wheel and swathes of blue suede-like upholstery. The interior even includes padded areas of the centre console that act as kneepads for hard driving. The brand has also implied that software updates to the car could enhance its performance. CEO Koji Sato has also mentioned Toyota’s developments regarding a ‘manual’ gearshift for electric cars, designed to introduce more involvement into the process. It’s all part of Toyota’s mission to make low and zero-emissions cars that aren’t just for transport. The brand says that it ‘Toyota believes that future mobility will go beyond providing physical transportation tools to becoming a lifestyle partner closely aligned with each customer’s individual values.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

587,Ferrari 296 Challenge: a new 690bhp toy for Maranello's Corse Clienti,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ferrari/296-challenge/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-10-28,Car Magazine UK,"This is the Ferrari 296 Challenge, the latest weapon of choice for Maranello’s global one-make series. It’ll be raced in the four FIA-homologated Ferrari Challenge championships (North America, Europe, UK and Japan) and will take over from the 488 Challenge Evo. Ferrari engineers have borrowed from Maranello’s GT3 program to add power and downforce, but they’ve also aimed to give the new Challenge more usable performance than ever before. Here’s everything you need to know about the new 296 Challenge. It does, doesn’t it – but that’s probably because the 296 GTB is already the prettiest Ferrari you can buy for the road. For Ferrari engineers, making the 296 the latest Challenge car was an obvious choice; it has an agile, short wheelbase, a compact V6-engine (the hybrid element hasn’t made it to the Challenge car) and it’s unmistakably a Ferrari, too. The 296 Challenge buries the roadcar in a significant amount of aero inspired by the GT3 program; there’s a huge front splitter across the front (that’s actually bigger than the GT3’s) and there are also several features on the side of the car to coax air around. What’s more, the 296 Challenge features an F1-derived S-duct integrated into the front bonnet, which the standard car doesn’t have. That’s partly because of the removal of the hybrid system – but we’ll get to that later. The 296 Challenge will primarily be run by gentleman drivers so Ferrari’s technical team has focused on making it fast – but also reliable and predictable for amateur drivers. To that end, the car has 18% more downforce (now 870kg at 250kmh) than the outgoing car, but it’s less peaky and more intuitive. The 296’s S-duct isn’t just there for show; it’s designed to help the car generate more downforce from its reshaped floor. The overall result? The new 296 Challenge is 2.0 seconds a lap faster at the Mugello track than the 488. Maranello has ditched the hybrid system for maintenance and lightness reasons – but it’s increased the power output of the V6 by using GT3-derived tech. Power is now up to 690bhp at 7500rpm, and that equates to 231bhp-per-litre. Torque in the new powertrain is 546 ft lbs. Removing the hybrid system has brought significant weight savings over the road car; so the 296 GTB weighs 1470kg, while the Challenge is just 1330kg. Most of that is from the hybrid system’s removal, the rest from new plastic and aluminium parts (rather than carbonfibre ones) and a brake system that’s 3kg lighter. Ferrari engineers have used redesigned carbon fibres in the new Challenge’s brake discs, and it means the discs last three times longer than before – along with a doubling of the brake pad life. Pirelli has also worked with Ferrari to develop a tyre that’s predictable and that degrades at a slower, more understandable rate. The 296 Challenge will replace the current 488 Evo in the North American and European championships in 2024, and will be introduced to the Japanese and UK championships the year after.

588,What are autonomous car levels? Levels 1 to 5 of driverless vehicle tech explained,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/autonomous-car-levels-different-driverless-technology-levels-explained/,Tim Pollard,2023-11-01,Car Magazine UK,"If you’re interested in the future of transport, you’ll probably have heard of the autonomous car levels already. Simply put, they’re a set of guidelines determined by the to describe the differing levels of autonomy in driverless cars. There are currently five levels in total – we’ll explain why that’s happened in a bit – with Level 1 being the most basic and Level 5 being the most advanced forms of self-driving cars. It covers everything from simple feet-off cruise control to full hands-off everything. Autonomy is a hot topic right now and the UK government is grappling with how to update legislation to allow for driverless cars on our roads. They’re even planning to mandate that the driver could be watching television while the car takes over. Read more on the . It’s pretty straightforward. What is now called Level 1 has been around for many years now, and Level 2 is commonplace too. We’re on the cusp of Level 3 and the next big thing – proper hands-off driving for long periods of time – is called Level 4 and, ultimately Level 5. This is the sci-fi vision of the future where cars are doing for you. For the past few years, car brands have begun to pick up and use the autonomous level terminology – the Audi A8’s Level 3 autonomous skillset was heavily promoted at its launch – but what the levels are, or what they actually mean, isn’t widely publicised. To make things easier, we’ve explained every level of driverless tech, as well as who’s in control, what features they include, and when they’ll be on our roads. has created a lexicon of autonomy. Level 1, the most basic type, is where one element of the driving process is taken over in isolation, using data from sensors and cameras, but the driver is very much still in charge. This started in the late 1990s at Mercedes-Benz, with its pioneering radar-managed cruise control, while Honda introduced lane-keep assist on the 2008 Legend. These were the first steps towards removing the driver’s duties behind the wheel. Level 2 autonomy is mostly where we’re at today: computers take over multiple functions from the driver – and are intelligent enough to weave speed and steering systems together using multiple data sources. Mercedes says it’s been doing this for most of the past decade. The latest is Level 2-point-something. It takes over directional, throttle and brake functions for one of the most advanced cruise control systems yet seen – using detailed sat-nav data to brake automatically for corners ahead, keeping a set distance from the car in front and setting off again when jams clear, with the driver idle. Highly automated vehicles are beginning to arrive on UK roads. The SAE calls Level 3 ‘conditional automation’ – a specific mode which lets all aspects of driving be done for you, but crucially the driver must be on hand to respond to a request to intervene. Audi calls its a ‘Level 3 ready’ autonomous car and the BMW 7-series is launching hands-off motorway cruising – meaning the car has the potential to drive itself in certain circumstances, where it will assume control of all safety-critical functions. How? By refining maps, radar and sensors and fusing this environmental data with ever-wiser and faster processors and logic. Today’s assumption of a two-second comms lag will soon look very slow. By the second half of this decade cars will fully drive themselves in geofenced metropolitan areas, as HD mapping, more timely data, car-to-car comms and off-site call centres (to deal with unusual hazards) improve accuracy. ‘You won’t really need the driver in Level 4,’ says Merc’s autonomous guru Christoph von Hugo. ‘The likelihood is you will just be renting the car, rather than owning it. You won’t take this car on vacation to Florida but you’ll take it on an urban journey around New York, say. It is easier to have ultra-detailed mapping for carefully defined areas.’ The difference between Level 4 and 5 is simple: the last step towards full automation doesn’t require the car to be in the so-called ‘operational design domain’. Rather than working in a carefully managed (usually urban) environment with lots of dedicated lane markings or infrastructure, it’ll be able to self-drive anywhere. How? Because the frequency and volume of data, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the sophistication of the computers crunching it, will mean the cars are sentient. It’s a brave new world – and one that Google’s Waymo car is gunning for, leapfrogging traditional manufacturers’ efforts.

589,New 2024 Mercedes E-Class Estate arrives priced from £58k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/e-class-estate/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-02,Car Magazine UK,"In a move that should surprise no one, Mercedes has launched an estate version of the new E-Class. It went on sale in the UK from November 2023, becoming a fresh rival for some of the , such as the BMW 5-series Touring, Audi A6 Avant and Skoda Superb Estate. Prices start at £57,930 for the E200 AMG Line Estate, stretching to £78,835 (and beyond, depending on options) for the E300e Estate in AMG Line Premium Plus spec. Changes over the are concentrated on the rear end. The Estate has a much larger boot and a slightly taller roofline, which increases boot capacity from 540 litres to 615 litres while liberating a couple of extra millimetres of headroom for rear seat passengers. This sounds good, but it’s worth noting the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate’s boot is 35 litres smaller than the previous generation model’s – and if you specify it with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, boot capacity falls to 460 litres. That’s only four litres more than you get from the boot of a . The E-Class Estate also features an air-sprung rear axle, which can level out the ride height when you pile weight into the boot. All-round air suspension will also be available as an optional extra. From launch, the E-Class Estate will be available with three engines. The cheapest model in the range will be the E200. It features a mild hybrid 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol unit producing 201bhp and 236lb/ft of torque. Mercedes that’s enough grunt for a 0–62mph time of 7.8 seconds and a top speed of 144mph. Fuel economy ranges between 37.1mpg and 42.1mpg. Above that, there’s the E220d. It’s powered by a mild hybrid 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine with 194bhp and 325lb/ft of torque. Its 0–62mph time and top speed are slightly slower than the petrol model at 7.9 seconds and 143mph respectively, but it compensates for that with its superior fuel economy. In official WLTP tests, it achieved between 49.5mpg and 56.4mpg. Stepping up again, there’s the plug-in hybrid E300e. It blends the E200’s 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a beefy electric motor and a 25.4kWh battery pack for a combined output of 227bhp and 406lb/ft of torque. It’ll be the fastest accelerating model in the Estate range from launch with a 0–62mph time of 6.5 seconds, although its top speed is the lowest at 141mph. But performance isn’t really the point of the PHEV – it’s efficiency. Mercedes says the E300e can achieve more than 300mpg on the WLTP combined cycle, although that figure requires you to charge the car regularly and make the most of its 70-mile electric-only range. You bet it is. Like the saloon, you can specify the cabin with Mercedes’s new Superscreen infotainment system. It consists of three displays – one for the digital gauge cluster, a shared touchscreen for the centre of the dashboard and a separate touchscreen to keep your front passenger entertained as you drive along. The screens are also compatible with third party applications, such as Vivaldi web browser, social media platforms such as TikTok and smartphone games like Angry Birds. You can even work in the E-Class’s cabin – the video conferencing app Zoom is compatible with the infotainment system and there’s a selfie camera mounted on top of the dashboard. Mercedes hasn’t officially acknowledged the existence of the next E-Class All-Terrain but Felix Korn, product manager for the E-Class and E-Class Estate, has hinted it’ll arrive in 2024. It’ll become one of the few cars left in the rough-and-tumble estate niche, rivalling the likes of the Ford Focus Active Estate, and . Like the previous generation car, it’ll take the E-Class Estate’s body as a starting point and add lifted suspension, black plastic wheel arch extensions, tough front and rear bumpers and standard-fit four-wheel drive – all of which will allow it to tackle some light off-roading. We challenged Korn about Mercedes’s decision to launch a new E-Class All-Terrain. We assumed that buyers who want a more rugged vehicle would simply opt for one of the company’s many SUVs instead, but Korn told us Mercedes is remaining committed to the segment. Even though All-Terrain models are expected to only constitute between 2 and 3 percent of E-Class sales, he said this was a margin worth chasing because of the low cost of production. The off-road variant can be sent down the same assembly line as the conventional Estate – so why not make it? Sadly, the All-Terrain model won’t be coming to the UK. Mercedes has no plans to launch it in right-hand drive markets – but maybe if we all protest enough, executives will change their minds.

590,New 2024 Skoda Superb: evolution not revolution,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/superb/,Keith Adams,2023-11-02,Car Magazine UK,"The wraps have come off the fourth-generation Skoda Superb, and as the teaser pictures promised, it may be wearing a conservative set of clothes, but this is an all-new car with a massively updated interior, now underpinned by VWG’s MQB Evo platform and built alongside the new Passat. Unike its German sister car, the Superb is available as a hatchback as well as estate, and the sleek new flagship comes with a range of petrols and diesel engines as well as a plug-in hybrid. It has a lot to live up to as the outgoing model is a favourite of long-distance drivers, chauffeurs, antique dealers and car journalists everywhere – in fact anyone who appreciates its squidgy ride, voluminous cabin and utter lack of pretentiousness. The early signs are good, though. We’ve already driven the newcomer in Superb Estate form ( ), and it’s a distinct improvement. The Superb Mk4 might look same-again, but it’s much sleeker and more ‘premium’ in the metal. Both models get second-generation LED Matrix beam headlights, which flank the sharper-looking front end and octagonal Skoda grille. Aerodynamics have taken a step forward with an impressive Cd of 0.23 for the hatch and 0.25 for the estate – a reduction of 10-15%. Moderate increases in length and height have further improved the overall dimensions in the interior. Boot capacity has grown by 20 litres to 645 litres for the hatch and by 30 litres to 690 litres for the estate. This means it remains at the head of the class, for luggage space, while rear legroom remains as impressive as ever. The Skoda and the VW were developed in parallel, so there may have been concern in some quarters that the Superb was going load-lugger only as well – although not if you’ve read our earlier reports on the Mk4, which made the hatchback’s presence clear. Skoda, it seems, has listened to the cacophony of grumbles that touch sensitive buttons and the removal of all physical controls has resulted in across models from all brands. VW Group has been hit hard by this criticism, particularly with models like the Mk8 Golf and ID.3, and has had to backtrack on their rollout. Skoda, it seems, has taken a more considered approach with the new Superb and the . That doesn’t mean there still isn’t a massive screen in the new generation, however. In fact, the latest Superb features a 12.9-inch central touchscreen as standard, likely running a new-generation infotainment system set to be rolled out across many brands within the VW Group. Beneath that, though, is a set of three physical dials and a couple of additional physical buttons. Skoda says the dials in the middle can be customised to allow quick access to the controls you use most using small screens inside them. The good news is that the quality seems. tohave taken a distinct step forward, with some very tactile materials used, as well as tasteful use of colour. Elsewhere, Skoda says it’s used olive tanning in its latest leathers, which is more environmentally friendly than regular tanning – and a technique Bentley also uses with its model. And, in order to provide more space in the centre console, Skoda has moved the shifter onto the steering column, much like VW’s ID models. The interior trim packages follows a similar structure to the Enyaq, offering seven ‘Design Selections’ The Studio Design Selection with black and grey fabrics is included with the basic Essence trim level. In addition, you can choose the Loft, Lounge, Suite Black, Suite Cognac, L&K Black and L&K Suite Cognac. It remains to be seen how many of these will make it to the UK. Skoda has fiddled with the Superb’s dimensions. Now, we’re not convinced that the Superb needed to get any larger – the current car is already an absolute unit – but the next model will be 43mm longer and 12mm taller than before. Skoda says the changes liberate an extra 11mm of headroom in the front, 6mm of headroom in the rear and 20 litres of boot space, taking the hatchback’s seats-up capacity to a whopping 645 litres. However, legroom is comparable to the current car, as the Superb Mk4’s wheelbase remains unchanged. Every version of the Superb Mk4 comes as standard with the VW Group’s latest suite of safety features – including an autonomous emergency braking system that can now detect cyclists. There’s also a new Crossroad Assist function that uses radar sensors in the bumper to monitor traffic at blind junctions and issue you a warning if you’re about to drive yourself into an accident. Skoda has also increased the number of airbags in the Superb. The new car will be available with up to 10. As standard, you’ll get front, side and head airbags, a driver’s knee airbag and a central airbag to prevent the front passenger from headbutting each other in the event of a side impact. Skoda will also offer two side airbags for the rear seats as an optional extra. Surprisingly, given current trends in the new car market, Skoda hasn’t gone all-in on electrification. The next Superb will be sold with both plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid powertrains for the first time, but the company still plans to offer the car with two diesel engines and a pair of high-powered petrols. That’s good news considering the Superb is designed for covering ground conveniently. The range will open with an all-new 1.5-litre four-cylinder mild hybrid petrol unit – and the petrol engine is from the Volkswagen Group’s latest EA211 Evo 2 family of engines which run on the fuel-efficient Miller cycle (like Toyota’s petrol engines) and feature cylinder deactivation technology. Like the current Superb’s 1.5-litre petrol engine, it’ll have an output of 148bhp. We found the new Superb PHEV rather interesting, too. Skoda has more than doubled the capacity of its battery pack, increasing it from 12.7 to 25.7kWh. The company says that will allow the car to cover up to 62 miles on electric power alone. It’ll even be compatible with 50kW DC rapid charging, which will trim charge times and allow owners to make the most of its electric range. The petrol engine backing up the electric motor is the same basic unit used in the mild hybrid Superb, although it’s mated to a six-speed automatic gearbox rather than a seven-speed unit. The system will have a maximum combined output of 201bhp, which is the same as the current Superb PHEV. Skoda hasn’t upset the apple cart with the Superb’s non-electrically assisted petrol and diesel engines. They appear to be retuned versions of the same range of 2.0-litre four-cylinder units that power the current car. The petrol engines have outputs of 201bhp and 261bhp, while the diesel produce 148bhp and 187bhp. All four engines send drive through a seven-speed automatic gearbox as standard, while the most powerful options come with four-wheel drive as standard. Although this was a static reveal, we’ve already driven it in prototype form. Our early run in the ppetrol and diesel models gave us an early taste of the new generation car. As you’d expect from the spec sheet, there’s little in the way of surprises in how it goes and what it sounds like. It’s a relaxed and confident performer, and although it’s not the last word in responsiveness, we couldn’t help admire how finished this prototype felt – but then, the drivetrain’s not really changed that much over the old one. The suspension set-up’s moved on, though. The outgoing car’s body control is acceptable once you stick it in Sport, but a little flabby otherwise. This one, now underpinned by the latest version of adaptive suspension (now called Dynamic Chassis Control Pro) is a great deal more responsive. Yes, the ride is stiffer than before, but it’s well damped and never could be described as uncomfortable. In bends, it turns in with more eagerness, and it tracks corners accurately. It’s no 3-Series, but it’s certainly an improvement. Definitely noteworthy are the fabulous front seats. They’re supportive and the driving position is spot on, and we love the headrests that adjust fore and aft as well as up and down. There’s as much space as the outgoing Superb up front, but thanks to that column-mounted transmission selector, there’s loads of space for your phones and other nick-nacks. There’s excellent space in the rear, as you’d expect, and there’s a fold-down centre armrest with integrated tablet holder. Nice. More than the current car. Skoda hasn’t confirmed prices and specs yet, but, the existing Superb hatchback has a starting price of around £32,605, and we expect the Mk4 model, with its larger dimensions, fancy new hybrid powertrains and lashings of fresh technology, will start from around £34,000. Prices for the estate will likely start from roughly £35,000 and UK sales are expected for all models is expected to commence in towards the end of Q2 2024. Keith is the Editor of Parkers.

591,"New Mercedes CLE Coupe goes on sale, priced from £47k",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/cle-coupe/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-07,Car Magazine UK,"This is the new 2023 Mercedes CLE Coupe and UK prices have been confirmed to start from £46,605. It’s a two-door coupe which will replace both the C-Class and E-Class Coupe, becoming a fresh rival for the likes of and Audi A5 in the process. It’ll hit UK showrooms at the end of 2023 – and it’ll be followed by a drop-top variant in spring 2024 which will square up to cars such as and the upcoming . Read our here. Compressing two cars into one is a bold move, especially when you consider the size, spec and price differences between the old C-Class and E-Class Coupes. But Mercedes is confident it can make do with one model, as it prunes its range to become more streamlined (and therefore cheaper to manufacture and maintain). Buyers can choose from four trim levels: AMG Line, AMG Line Premium, AMG Line Premium Plus and Premier Edition. UK prices start at £46,605 for the entry-level CLE 200 AMG Line, climbing to £72,765 for a range-topping CLE 450 4Matic in Premier Edition. Bianca Licina, product manager for the new CLE, told CAR: ‘We observed the market and we have been in touch with our customers from C- and E-class – and we noticed that their customer needs have developed differently. C-Class Coupe customers wanted to get a car with more size and more status, while the E-Class customer wanted to have a more dynamic and more sporty car. ‘When we did this research, we noticed that we would create two very similar cars that would be too similar to each other, if we continued this path of having two coupes. That was the reason why we said, “Hey, let’s cover both needs in one car.” ‘With the CLE, we wanted to respond to these changing conditions and we kind of redefined the coupe segment for Mercedes-Benz. That means that we will offer one coupe in the mid-size segment in the future, which will be the successor model of the C- and E-Class coupe.’ The CLE was designed to be a Swiss Army knife of a two-door. So, to serve Mercedes’s practicality-conscious coupe buyers, it has enough room in the rear for two adults. It also has a 420-litre boot, which the firm’s engineers proudly state is large enough to swallow three sets of golf clubs. How very Teutonic. In a bid to entice keen drivers, though, the CLE will be available with some clever chassis technology, a 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine and at least one fire-breathing AMG powertrain. But has Merc covered all the bases well enough? We’ve spent some time in the studio with the CLE to get the low-down before it hits showrooms later in 2023. Some of them will be. The model that piqued our interest is the CLE 450. It features a turbocharged 3.0-litre straight six petrol engine with 375bhp and 369lb ft of torque. Mercedes says it’ll be able to shove the coupe from 0–62mph in 4.4 seconds before running into its electronic buffer at 155mph. There’s a faster AMG-badged version of the CLE on the way, too, although Mercedes hasn’t yet told us which of its performance engines it’ll use. But, given its mechanical similarities to the C-Class saloon, we expect it’ll feature the same 670bhp PHEV powertrain as the . The rest of the CLE’s engine choices are all turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol and diesel units. The line-up opens with the 220d. It produces 197bhp and 324lb ft of torque – and it’s the only diesel in the coupe’s line-up. It’s also the joint-slowest engine, taking 7.5 seconds to sprint from 0–62mph. It is, at least, the most efficient on paper returning up to 60.1mpg on the WLTP combined cycle. Above that, there’s the petrol-powered CLE 200. It produces 201bhp and 236lb ft of torque, serving up a 0–62mph time of 7.4 seconds and top speed of 147mph. The CLE 300 features a brawnier version of the same engine with 254bhp, 295lb ft of torque and a 0–62mph time of 6.2 seconds. The 200 is also optionally available with four-wheel drive, while the 300 and 450 are fitted with the drivetrain as standard. Every engine is mated to a nine-speed automatic gearbox and they all benefit from mild hybrid assistance to improve fuel economy and trim CO2 emissions. The Mercedes CLE Coupe uses the same MRA platform found under the , although the brand’s engineers have fiddled with its dimensions to make the new car feel unique, they claim. The CLE is 4850mm long and 1428mm tall, which makes it 99mm longer and 10mm lower than the saloon. However, the wheelbases of both cars are identical at 2865mm. The biggest change for the CLE is its track width. It’s swelled by 40mm at the front and 70mm at the rear, which Mercedes says has improved handling compared to the C-Class saloon. The Coupe’s suspension is also 15mm lower, which has dropped the car’s centre of mass closer to the tarmac. Buyers will also be able to specify the car with adaptive dampers and rear-wheel steering, which Mercedes hopes will increase the car’s appeal for keen drivers. The former upgrade will help to keep the body flat in the corners, while the latter promises to make the car more eager to hunt apexes. The rear-wheel steering system also carves half a metre out of the CLE’s turning circle. Buyers will be able to choose from alloy wheels ranging between 18 and 20 inches in diameter. The entry-level trim in the UK will be Mercedes AMG Line specification, which comes with 19-inch alloys as standard. Mercedes knows how tatty UK roads are, though, so buyers will be able to specify smaller 18-inch alloys on all but the CLE 450 for a little more compliance. Up front, it’s very similar to the C-Class saloon. It features the same 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 11.9-inch portrait infotainment system and dashboard design. In fact, the equipment levels will be comparable between the two cars, as the CLE will also come as standard with keyless go, memory seats and a customisable ambient lighting system. We quizzed Bianca Licina about why the CLE wouldn’t be available with the used in the . She explained: ‘The concept of the interior – and that was a conscious decision to not take another display in the car – is that it focuses on the driver. [This way] you as a driver can focus on the road and driving pleasure.’ Despite being based on Mercedes’s ageing infotainment technology, the CLE’s touchscreen will also be compatible with a range of third-party applications such as the social media platform TikTok, the video conferencing tool Zoom and the internet browser Vivaldi. Rather than spending time reinventing its infotainment suite, Mercedes poured its energy into making the new CLE more practical than the old C-Class Coupe. Its wheelbase is 25mm longer than the old C-Class which, when coupled with some clever packaging and some scalloped front seat backs, has helped liberate an extra 72mm of kneeroom for those in the back. The CLE’s larger dimensions have also created an extra 10mm of headroom and 19mm of shoulder room for those in the back. One of our six-foot testers sat in the rear of the car in the studio and he found it more accommodating than the old C-Class Coupe. Mercedes hasn’t told us yet, but it won’t be cheap. Prices for the C-Class Coupe start from around £46,000, while the outgoing E-Class Coupe is priced from a shade over £51,000. Given that the new CLE is closer to the E-Class in terms of its dimensions, we reckon it’ll be priced closer to £50,000. We challenged Licina on whether the price of the new CLE would still be attractive to C-Class Coupe buyers. She said: ‘I would say it will be challenging but acceptable. I mean, it’s an emotional reason to buy it or not to buy it, right? So, if you’re a coupe lover; if you want an emotional car; if you want sportiness, you will pay – I don’t know – five, six thousand euro more just to have it, right?’ Luke is the Deputy Editor of our sister site Parkers, but he spends plenty of time writing news, reviews and features for CAR.

592,SEMA 2023: highlights of the show’s wild modified cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/sema/2023/,Jake Groves,2023-11-07,Car Magazine UK,"What happens at SEMA, stays at SEMA? Unlikely. The 2023 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show is under way, with several major car brands taking to the enormous Las Vegas Convention Center to show off their wares. Here are some of the highlights of the 2023 show: Precious little defines SEMA other than the simple request for MORE. So much so that Ford Performance has introduced a 3.0-litre Whipple supercharger kit for V8 models of the latest Mustang generation. With it applied, power can jump to beyond 800bhp – all without breaking your warranty. It’s a heavily modified version of Hyundai’s new Kona, dripping with lifestyle equipment and sweet details. The fetching colour is ‘robin’s egg blue’, the car is lowered with new Eibach springs and it features a roof box and bike rack from Thule. The best bit is inside, though, with the stock seats being thrown out in favour of Recaro Sportster CS seats with a fantastically jazzy plaid pattern. It’s all about the great outdoors for Lexus, introducing LX and GX SUVs that are packed to the brim with off-road engineering and clever tricks for making the most of the countryside. Among the mix of show cars is an Aquamarine Blue LX fitted with a quick-release awning, roof rack for surf boards and a mini camping kitchen. Another includes a previous-generation GX fitted with a hammock and some handy essentials for tough off-roading. Another big player at SEMA, Nissan has pulled out the stops with tonnes of new modified builds. These are some of the highlights: Arguably the car that’s stolen the show this year: a rally-spec Nissan Z built by Tommy Pike Customs. A raised ride height comes via custom KW suspension, with bespoke wheels shod in Yokohama off-road tyres. The Z’s power has been pushed north of 400bhp, with a tuneful growl spouting out a cat-back exhaust. Another off-road build, this time direct from Nissan’s NISMO division. The Rogue features a three-inch suspension lift kit, custom carbonfibre detailing and a centre exhaust. The Rogue also features prototype parts, including off-road-spec wheels, roof rack and bumper guard. The Japanese brand always goes big at SEMA, and 2023 is no different with four individual builds and a whole load of build concepts. Toyota wants to bring back the idea of a modified street truck with this: the X-Runner. It’s 3.4-litre V6 engine has been uprated (via an official TRD upgrade pack Toyota will sell in the States in 2024), there’s an electronic rear differential and side pipes complement its angry look. This almost looks like something out of a kid’s toy box. Lift up an FJ45 pickup, cram in a 725bhp V8 engine from a NASCAR racer, install a race-spec three-speed auto (who knew those existed?) and it’s a solid start. Finish the job with two Currie differentials (one for each axle), Fox shock absorbers, Eibach springs and BF Goodrich Krawler tyres and you’re almost there. To celebrate the latest-generation Land Cruiser returning to North America, Toyota is wheeling out a classic restomod: the Rod Millen Group’s 1967 FJ45 Land Crusier Wagon, which is nicknamed the Retro Cruiser. Toyota’s involvement in the DC movie Blue Beetle has resulted in this modded, and heaviliy graffit’d Tacoma truck. UK-based modifier Urban is showing its wares at the SEMA show by taking up some space on the Milltek Corp stand. Its two show cars – a full-size new Rangie and a Rolls-Royce Ghost – are fully tarted up with Urban’s latest bodykit trimmings and feature performance exhausts from Milltek. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

593,Bloodhound LSR seeks new driver in bid for 1000mph dream,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bloodhound-ssc/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-11-08,Car Magazine UK,"Wanted: new recruit to drive change in startup firm. Must be comfortable working under pressure in a fast-paced environment. Desirable traits: experience with jet engineering, strong tolerance to g-force, ability to raise c.£12m in funding… Yes, the Bloodhound LSR (Land Speed Record) project is on the hunt for a new driver. The owner of the project, Wing Commander Stuart Edmondson, is hoping that the potential new recruit will be able to bring the required funding to finally finish the project and make a crack at the world record. The ill-fated Bloodhound project has stalled many times since its inception in 2008, but the current team hopes that a driver with the appropriate financial backing and the skills will be able to take the car to the top of the leaderboard. The driver hunt will take place in a week-long roadshow, catchily titled ‘Race to Greatness: Bloodhound Land Speed Record Driver Search’. The Bloodhound team describes it as ‘an exciting and captivating campaign’ and a ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity [that] will attract passionate and skilled individuals who are ready to push the boundaries of speed’. Current driver and Land Speed Record holder since 1997, Wing Commander Andy Green, will ‘remain very much a key member of the team’, supporting and mentoring the new driver. Green was the first person to break the sound barrier in ThrustSSC, and his record of 763mph has stood since. Edmondson, who was ‘handed the keys’ to Bloodhound in 2022, says that the project is potentially still up for sale but is looking at all forms of sponsorships, partnerships and investments. It’s hoped that a new driver could be an attractive proposition to attract sponsors and media attention, bringing in the circa £12m of funding the team reckons is required to set a new record. The team also hopes to make Bloodhound the first Net Zero LSR holder – using synthetic fuels rather than fossil-derived fuels, which Edmondson feels is more appropriate. The roadshow to find a new driver started at the British Motor Museum on November 8. It’ll move through the country, to Silverstone on November 9, the RAF Museum at Hendon on November 10-11, Brooklands Museum on November 12, the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu on November 13 and Caffeine & Machine in Warwickshire on November 14. Each location will feature a full-scale replica of the Bloodhound LSR car. Read more on the Bloodhound LSR project below… The Bloodhound land speed record project is up for sale again. After a successful test in South Africa in 2019, in which the car got up to speeds of 628mph, the current owner Ian Warhurst is now stepping away from the project. Warhurst saved the project from total cancellation in 2018, but the Covid-19 pandemic has understandably changed the Bloodhound project’s trajectory. A record-breaking 1000mph run is now penciled in for 2022 – funding allowing. ‘It has been a privilege to lead this team of world-class engineers over the past two years. I was spellbound – along with a huge audience around the world – as we tested the car up to 600+ mph in South Africa,’ said Warhurst. ‘When I committed to take the car high speed testing in 2019, I allocated enough funding to achieve this goal on the basis that alternative funding would then allow us to continue to the record attempts. Along with many other things, the global pandemic wrecked this opportunity in 2020 which has left the project unfunded and delayed by a further 12 months.’ If bought again, the next owner of Bloodhound would need to stub up some £8million for the next phase of the project; installing a Nammo monopropellant rocket that’ll power the car to 800mph. Like the previous test, the Nammo test would be carried out at Hakskeen Pan, Northern Cape, SA. You can read more about Ian’s take over of the project below. After going into administration in 2018 – and then being bailed out by Yorkshire entrepreneur Ian Warhurst – the Bloodhound land-speed record attempt relaunched today. Warhurst, the CEO of Grafton LSR has moved headquarters of the Bloodhound to SGS Berkeley Green University Technical College (UTC), and given the car a new look, too. There’s echoes of the Force India, Racing Point story here, isn’t there? ‘Since buying Bloodhound from the administrators last December, the team and I have been overwhelmed by the passion and enthusiasm the public have shown for the project,’ said Warhurst. ‘Over the last decade, an incredible amount of hard graft has been invested in the project and it would be a tragedy to see it go to waste. Starting with a clean slate, it’s my ambition to let Bloodhound off the leash see just how fast this car can go.’ The car will now be called the Bloodhound LSR rather than SSC, and we’re told that the red-and-white livery should soon give way to more sponsors in the future – provided the car stays on track, that is. ‘With Ian providing the cashflow to keep the project on track, Bloodhound LSR is a very different sponsorship proposition to the blue and orange car,’ Grafton LSR’s commercial director Ewen Honeyman said. ‘We’re already having detailed discussions with a number of organisations about exciting new sponsorship possibilities, as well as talking to those involved in the previous phase of the programme.’ Next up is high-speed testing, and after that, the aim is to break the world land speed record, which currently sits at 763.035mph. Once that’s broken, and engineers assess how the car behaves at transonic and supersonic speed levels, the target will be the car’s theoretical 1000mph top-speed. The Bristol-based Bloodhound team are working to surpass today’s world record of 763mph. There are still years of testing and development ahead, however; Bloodhound had planned to test on the salt flats of Hakskeen Pan in South Africa in 2019. A special 11-mile high-speed track is being prepared in the Northern Cape for the record attempt. The organisation appointed Andrew Sheridan and Geoff Rowley, partners at specialist business advisory firm FRP Advisory LLP, as joint administrators on 15 October 2018. The news followed a successful 200mph straight line test in Cornwall, and came a decade after the project was first revealed in 2007. ‘Whilst not an insignificant amount, the £25 million Bloodhound requires to break the land speed record is a fraction of the cost of, for example, finishing last in a F1 season or running an America’s Cup team,’ administrator Sheridan said in a statement at the time. ‘This is an opportunity for the right investor to leave a lasting legacy. We are already in discussion with a number of potential investors and would encourage any other interested party to contact us without delay.’ They have now found the necessary funds for the project to continue. The Bloodhound is powered by a Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine from a Eurofighter, a cluster of Nammo hybrid rockets and a 550bhp Jaguar V8. At full chat, it’s due to cover a mile in 3.6 seconds. The 135,000bhp motor drives the 7.5-tonne, four-wheeled missile for just long enough to hit the 1000mph barrier, in theory. As for stopping it? An air brake deploys at 800mph, the parachute at 600mph and conventional friction discs come into play at ‘just’ 200mph. The  team behind the Bloodhound SSC land speed record have already completed a 200mph dry-run – in Cornwall! The plan was then for the supersonic jet car to head to South Africa for summer testing. Airbrakes and new winglets (visible in this rendering by Flock and Siemens) would have been added as the speed ramped up. The Bloodhound SSC’s cabin is cramped and looks more like the cockpit of a Eurofighter jet than a car. Which means it’s business as usual for Andy Green, the RAF pilot who will drive it. Fighter pilot Green, who received an OBE for his earlier records, said: ‘I’ve met graduate engineers who are adamant that our previous record was what inspired their career choice as youngsters: that sort of thing makes all the effort worthwhile.’ The Bloodhound project has been off-schedule from the very beginning; in 2009, it aimed for a 800mph run, followed by a 900mph attempt in 2010 and the full 1000mph in 2011. It’s 2018 now, guys. It’s hard not to get wrapped up in the goodwill of this project though – proper, pushing-the-boundary innovation to inspire a generation.

594,"Volkswagen ID.7 will start from £55,570",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-7/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-09,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has announced that the its new flagship, the ID.7 , will cost from £55,570. The electric saloon is available to order now, with ‘a number of highly attractive offers’ available until January 2, 2023. Buyers of the ID.7 Pro Launch Edition can enjoy a free or £750 in public charging credits, as well as a £3000 deposit contribution and a reasonable 4.9% APR PCP deal. Pricing for other trim levels, or the ID.7 Tourer estate, has yet to be revealed. However the Pro Launch Edition comes well-equipped with 19-inch alloys, LED lights all round, the new 15-inch ‘Ready 2 Discover’ infotainment system, heated front seats, three-zone climate control and the usual assortment of safety kit. That price puts Volkswagen in a competitive area of the market. It’s priced identically to an entry-level BMW i4 and more expensive than a (admittedly smaller) Tesla Model 3 Long Range or Polestar 2 Long Range. However, it does undercut similarly-sized premium competition such as the Mercedes-Benz EQE. Passat buyers rejoice! Volkswagen has confirmed an estate version of the ID.7 will hit its showrooms in 2024. It’ll be called the ID.7 Tourer and it’ll team the standard car’s swoopy styling and efficient 400-mile-plus-capable electric powertrain with a boot large enough to hold the entire contents of your local garden centre. It’ll become Volkswagen’s first-ever electric estate car. When it goes on sale, it’ll compete against a mere handful of diverse rivals that include the , and . Volkswagen says that, with the rear seats folded flat, the ID.7 Tourer can carry up to 1714 litres of luggage. That figure is 82 litres larger than the company’s previous posh estate, the . And with the rear bench in place, you still have 545 litres of space in the boot which should be ample for a week’s luggage. Don’t scoff – Volkswagen reckons the ID.7 Tourer will be able to live up to its namesake and become an you can comfortably drive over long distances. The company hasn’t yet confirmed the EV’s official range, but we’re expecting the impact of the new estate body to be minimal. Volkswagen says the change has only dropped the car’s drag co-efficient from 0.23 to 0.24. We’ve already spotted an undisguised ID.7 Tourer prototype undergoing testing, but the car in Volkswagen’s official images wears a light camouflage wrap. The front end of the car remains unchanged – and buyers will be offered the same range of powertrains, battery packs, optional extras and interior technology as the saloon. You can read more about these specifications below. The Volkswagen ID.7 is the new flagship of the brand’s ever-growing , and one of ten electric cars Volkswagen intends to launch by 2026. It’s an Arteon-sized saloon that was designed to target the upper mid-range segment – and it introduces some clever new powertrain technology along with some much-needed interior revisions over the Volkswagen existing ID cars. It’ll be launched worldwide (unlike some ID models), with the saloon version of the car hitting European and Chinese markets by the end of 2023 before making the leap across the Atlantic to North America in 2024. The ID.7 will be manufactured in Volkswagen’s plant in Emden, Germany alongside the . Before Volkswagen officially acknowledged the existence of the ID.7 Tourer, the biggest news was the car was to become the third ID model to feature a hot GTX variant. It’ll get an undisclosed uptick in power plus a load of sporty styling tweaks to hopefully make up for the lack of a shouty turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine. More on that below. Look at the ID.7 from the front, and you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for an ID.3. Volkswagen has decided on a look for its ID range and it isn’t straying an inch from it. Just like the , it features short overhangs, a stubby bonnet, flush headlights and a raked windscreen. This styling isn’t just for show, either. It helps the ID.7 achieve a super sleek 0.23 drag co-efficient. After driving a near-production prototype, we must report that this comes with a compromise, though. Like the ID.3, this super-raked look does have an impact on visibility. Shame. But these are the sacrifices we make in the name of progress. Move away from the front and the ID.7 grows into a 4961mm saloon, with a low 1862mm roof. There isn’t much design happening down the car’s flanks, but it gets more interesting the further back you go. The rear lights, for example, have something of the about them. All things considered, though, this isn’t a particularly memorable-looking car. It’s the considered, understated design approach we’ve come to expect of the ID range, stretched to be saloon sized. The ID.7 debuts a raft of new technology seen for the first time in any ID car. Powertrain-wise, the electric saloon comes with a new 210kW motor that features stronger magnets, more windings, a higher wire cross-section and improved cooling. The overall result is a bump in efficiency and power, and one we expect to see trickling down to the rest of the ID range in time. From launch, buyers will only be offered the ID.7 Pro. It’ll be fitted with a 77kWh (gross 82kWh) battery pack that Volkswagen says is good for an estimated range of 382 miles (615km). A longer-legged Pro S model will arrive later featuring VW’s biggest battery to date – an 86kWh unit (91kWh gross) offering a maximum range of 434 miles (700km). The ID.7 will also become the first in its family to feature battery charge preconditioning. Simply prod the location of a charging station into the sat-nav and the car will prepare its battery to receive the maximum 200kW charge rate by the time you get there. Interestingly, this can be triggered manually too – great for those using or . The ID.7 debuts a raft of new technology seen for the first time in any ID car.

Interestingly, this can be triggered manually too – great for those using or . Volkswagen’s most recent infotainment system is the Achille’s heel of everything from the Golf to the Cupra Born – and the ID.7 represents Wolfsburg’s first attempt to fix some of its mistakes. So, the volume bar is now backlit, which means you can see where to swipe at night. Plus, the climate controls now have their own permanent hot bar on the saloon’s bright 15-inch infotainment screen. The result? You can see where to swipe now, and doing something as simple as changing the cabin temperature doesn’t take four screens of swiping and poking. Volkswagen’s engineers were also keen to point out the amount of customisation the new infotainment screen will offer. There are ‘favourite bars’ for your most-used apps, it’s possible to create your own ‘tiled’ home screens and you can customise a ‘car control centre.’ There’s also a range of shortcuts which owners will almost certainly learn and use to speed things up even more. Elsewhere, the ID.7 drops the pod-style cockpit dials of the ID.3 and ID.4 in favour of a smaller unit that’s integrated into the line of the car’s new ‘Smart Air Vents’ (more on those later). Volkswagen points to a new customisable augmented reality-enabled HUD as the primary display for the driver, with the amount of information it shows varying between a full view and a pared back one. It’s not all good news though. VW’s Smart Air Vents can be saved to user presents or be used in conjunction with the car’s voice controls – but alarmingly, they can only be moved by using the touchscreen. The result? If you want to change the direction of the vents you’ll need to delve into a dedicated screen and drag each one, or call out a setting to the car’s voice assistant. Sure, they may make the cabin look slightly neater, but ultimately these vents are another solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. What’re the chances of them being replaced by standard vents on the second-generation ID.7? The ID.7’s other party pieces include a panoramic sunroof with electrochromic technology, as well as a massage seats and ambient lighting. A 14-speaker, 700-watt sound system is also available. This isn’t a huge surprise. The ID.7 follows on from the ID.4 and ID.5, both of which are available with Volkswagen’s sporty GTX specification. However, while Volkswagen has acknowledged the ID.7 GTX’s existence, it hasn’t yet confirmed how much extra performance it’ll get over the standard car. If the other GTX models are setting the precedent, don’t expect huge gains in performance. Rather than being akin to its GTI models, the GTX trim is closer in character to Volkswagen’s GTE and GTD cars. We’re expecting a slight power increase, but nothing ground breaking. Volkswagen’s GTX trim is as much about the styling as it is the performance – and the ID.7 will be no exception. It’ll feature a red and black colour scheme inside and out, with the dark crimson being completed by gloss black replacements for the car’s door mirrors and roof. Inside, you’ll get contrasting stitching on the seats, dashboard and door panels. The GTX made its first global appearance at the on the 5 September 2023. The ID.7 comes with assisted parking and features assisted lane changing and adaptive lane guidance. You can read our early impressions of a .

595,"New Mini Countryman JCW: hot MINI's larger, lardier cousin returns with 296bhp",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mini/countryman/,Tim Pollard,2023-11-09,Car Magazine UK,"MINI has revealed the biggest, baddest version of its new Countryman, ahead of the model’s global launch next year. The MINI Countryman JCW (John Cooper Works) will be the hottest version of the Countryman when it launches with a similar formula to its predecessor – pairing a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine with ALL4 four-wheel drive and a sporting suspension setup. For the latest Countryman JCW, that engine pushes out 296bhp and 295lb ft, providing a 0-62mph sprint of 5.4 seconds. That makes it marginally less powerful than the old car, which was capable of 0-62mph in just 5.1 seconds. Top speed is an electronically limited 155mph. The Countryman’s power is sent through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox (the old car used an eight-speed torque converter) to all four wheels. The wheels in question are 19- or 20-inch alloys, larger and wider than the previous model’s. Visually, there’s plenty to mark it out as a JCW. Bespoke bumpers front and rear contain vertical reflectors, and new LED lights flank an octagonal grille in glossy black. The red and black colour scheme is typical JCW, and extends to a newly-designed C-pillar. Those colours continue on the inside, with a two-tone dash, sports seats and ‘atmospheric’ ambient lighting. It’ll cost from around £42,000 in the UK, comfortably undercutting the Volkswagen T-Roc R, Cupra Formentor 310 or BMW X1 M135i. Read more about the new MINI Countryman below… The new Mini Countryman has been unveiled ahead of its world debut at next week’s – and the big news is there’ll be a fully electric version this time round for the third generation. As with the regular , buyers will be able to choose from combustion or electric vehicle (EV) derivatives, as parent group BMW continues to hedge its bets in the great energy transformation remoulding the car industry. The 2024 Mini Countryman grows up, as the designers aim to broaden its appeal among families and those wanting more accommodation: it’s a significant 13cm longer and 6cm taller, freeing up more room for luggage and limbs onboard. Bootspace stands at 480 litres (+30 over its predecessor), stretching to 1450 if you flop the adjustable rear backrests down. The new compact crossover lands in UK showrooms in February 2024, priced from £28,500 for the least powerful petrol-powered Mini Countryman C. Three different petrol powertrains will be offered from launch: Notice the absence of any diesel powertrains, which have not been developed this time around, as the world gradually turns its back on derv engines. In fact, nor are there any manual transmissions; it’s auto only for the Countryman this time round (insert sad face emoji if you’re a fan of DIY gears). Three trim levels will be offered in the UK: Classic, Exclusive and Sport. Key to expanding the appeal of the Countryman is its swollen stance. It’s a more challenging design than the new Mini hatchback’s, also unveiled officially at the Munich motor show; where that car focuses on purer, simpler styling, the SUV maintains its slightly awkward Mini-meets-SUV character while stretching way past 4.4 metres in length. This is not an especially graceful crossover. Note the heavily stylised C-pillar featuring a contrast-colour panel – an attempt to remove some of the visual heft of the side profile. It’s fooling no-one. See the Countryman in the metal and you’ll quickly recognise this is a much bigger car – though it’s worth remembering that this growth spurt will free up space for the rightsized, 4m-long later in 2024. Where the Mini hatch loses its black plastic wheelarch surrounds, the Countryman keeps its perimeter cladding, in line with its more rugged, crossover character. Choice of alloy wheels stretches from 17in to 20in, depending on spec and powertrain. A pair of electric Mini Countrymans are available with the 2024 relaunch, carrying a chunky premium that positions even the cheapest model some way north of the most powerful JCW petrol. Both are powered by the same 65kWh battery pack: It’s a canny move to offer all fuels to all customers. Although pricey to engineer, the smorgasbord of powertrain choice should expand the appeal of the new 2024 Mini Countryman range and stretches BMW’s footprint into new niches. Note that the electric Countryman is actually based on a different platform to the hatchback EV (developed with China’s Great Wall). The new generation of Countryman will be built in Germany this time. BMW’s Leipzig plant was opened in March 2005 and currently makes the 1-series, 2-series Gran Coupe and 2-series Active Tourer – all of which run on the UKL platform used by both BMW and Mini. It’s the first time BMWs and Minis have ran on the same production line. Step inside the new Mini Countryman and the interior is largely carried over from the new hatchback. It’s a back-to-basics approach that strips out some of the complexity of earlier BMW-era Mini cabins and simplifies everything in one giant, 240mm-diameter round instrument pack. Instead of trying to shoe-horn rectangular digital read-outs into a circle, this time the whole OLED display is optimised to be circular, with navigation and apps designed in the round. Owners can flick between different modes, choosing sporty or retro typefaces for speedo and dials – and the whole interior is bathed in a choice of colours at nighttime, as projectors flash a light show across the textile dashboard in the dark. It’s pretty cool. We’ve sat inside and tried it, and can confirm it’s a giant leap forwards from what went before – albeit with a heavy emphasis on the digital experience. Witness the Mini Sounds feature, with a Mini jingle and 30 new noises for info and warning functions. You’ll either love it or reach for the earplugs pronto. The new Mini Countryman architecture comes with the latest software packs to premiere some new tricks: self-parking that can drive the car in or out of a specially tight space itself; hands-off autonomous driving at speeds of up to 37mph; and ‘Hey Mini’ voice-activated infotainment, complete with the Spike personal puppy assistant to operate nav, phone and entertainment systems. With Mini’s younger demographic, BMW is banking on the youthful digital heart of this car striking a chord – and the latest Android-based OS9 is shot through with Mini’s trademark joie de vivre. We’ll be poring all over the Mini Countryman at its IAA world debut, so come back for more detail in the coming days.

596,First pics of production-spec Polestar 5: four-door EV charges 10-80% in 10 mins,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/polestar/5/,Tim Pollard,2023-11-10,Car Magazine UK,"Polestar has revealed that its upcoming four-door GT, the Polestar 5, is capable of charging from 10-80% in just 10 minutes. That charging speed was achieved during a test of battery supplier StoreDot’s so-called extreme fast charging technology. Similar tests have been conducted in lab conditions, but Polestar claims this was first test carried out with an actual vehicle, in this case a prototype 5. The car used was fitted with a 77kWh battery featuring what Polestar describes as ‘silicon dominant’ cells. They have similar energy density to existing nickel manganese cobalt batteries, but don’t require extra cooling, StoreDot claims. Perhaps more significantly, the rate of charge actually speeded up during the test, from 310kW at 10% to 370kW at 80%. Polestar suggested that charge could add 200 miles of range to a mid-size EV in little more time than it takes to fill a fuel tank. The Polestar 5 (pictured below alongside the 6 convertible) was unveiled in production-spec form in November 2023 at the massive Polestar day event in Low Angeles. It sat among Polestar’s entire roster of current and future production cars at the event, where the company . Storedot has been hard at work developing the new battery chemistries, including solid state cells. The battery pack under the floor of the Polestar 5 feature’s StoreDot’s pouch cell design, which is claimed can give 100 miles of range with just five-minutes recharging from 50-80% – an assertion backed up by its performance in testing. After the test, Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said: “Time is one of life’s greatest luxuries. With this new technology, on longer journeys when drivers stop they’ll be able to spend less time charging and be back on the road faster than before. In fact, that stop time will be akin to what they experience with a petrol car today.” The Polestar 5 made its public debut in camo’d form being slung up the hill at the . ‘We love showing our latest prototypes to the public at Goodwood. With production now starting in the first quarter of 2024, it’s time for to take its first-ever run up the famous Hill,’ Ingenlath said during the Festival. ‘The SUV for the electric age looks fantastic and will be an exceptional car to own. The latest Polestar 5 verification prototype is here, too. Developed in the UK, Goodwood is like home turf for our electric four-door GT.’ With new models launching annually, by the end 2024 the will look something like this: The Polestar 5, due in showrooms later in 2024, closely follows the template set by the of 2020. It’s a four-door grand tourer that’s a Scandi alternative to the and . An aluminium intensive architecture underpins the 5. It’s the first fruits of Polestar’s new R&D base in the UK at the MIRA research facility in the Midlands, where a lightweight bonded platform is being developed to power top-end models. It’s the same technology deployed by the likes of Aston Martin plus inhouse Geely siblings Lotus and (the London taxi maker). That explains why Polestar has based its second engineering facility in the UK – to tap into that low-volume, high-tech expertise already existing nearby in Coventry. Whereas the 2, 3 and 4 models use Volvo and Geely platforms, the 5 and further low-volume spin-offs will be based around the exceptionally stiff structure developed by a team led by Pete Allen, head of Polestar UK R&D and the engineering brains behind the . He said: ‘The platform combines low-volume performance car attributes with modern technological advances to bring lightweight, high-rigidity sports car chassis technology into mass production.’ The bonded and riveted aluminium architecture is designed to be super-flexible, allowing a family of spin-offs to be deployed from the same hardware – including the 6 roadster. The 2024 Polestar 5 looks very similar to the 2020 Precept concept car (pictured below). Head of design Maximillian Missoni told CAR magazine: ‘Polestars should have control and precision, but also emotion.’ It goes without a conventional grille, instead having a so-called SmartZone which houses all the safety sensors and driver assistance tech. But more noticeable is that, like the Polestar 3, the 5 doesn’t nave a conventional back window. Instead, it has a huge sweep of glass from the trailing edge of the bonnet to just behind the back seats. Rearward vision is provided by cameras. The car seen at Goodwood rolled on giant 21-inch alloy wheels that give a purposeful stance, house brakes big enough to haul off the speed promised by 872bhp and a provide large contact patch for grippy handling. No word yet on performance figures, but with an electric motor at each axle and a stout 664lb ft of combined torque, it’s surely going to be nipping at the heels of supercars.

597,New Euro 7 emissions rules set to be softened after EU vote,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/what-is-euro-7-emission-standards/,Tom Webster,2023-11-10,Car Magazine UK,"The next round of European emissions standards, dubbed Euro 7 or EU7, are inching through the EU’s legislative process and are now likely to arrive in 2026 for passengers cars and 2027 for heavy goods vehicles. The European Parliament has approved its guidance on the emissions laws and it appears that they will be softer than originally conceived. Every new car sold in Europe will have to be able to pass EU7, which replaces the current EU6 emissions regs. It’s still not yet law and there is plenty of red tape yet to unravel: the European Parliament will now finesse the final approach with the European Commission and European Council, so expect more compromise and tweaking to follow. It is expected that the final document will be finalised by early 2024. Euro 7 is set to continue the emissions limits from EU6, limiting the nitrous oxides (NOx), particulate matter and carbon monoxide a combustion engine can emit. However, it now adds particulate emissions from brakes and tyres. With the demise of and cars planned some time between 2030 and 2035, we’ve got our first insight into what the emissions testers will be concentrating on when cars don’t have exhaust emissions. For the first time, , tyres and brakes are all set to be assessed, with testers rating their various impacts on the environment, both locally and globally. There are also plans afoot to keep tabs on cars throughout their lives, so they can be continually assessed – not just when they’re first registered and brand new. Electric cars don’t emit anything from an exhaust, so emissions testers shouldn’t be interested in them, right? Nope, the team behind the Euro 7 proposal have found a number of ways to assess EVs, concentrating on the electric part and several bits that are common to all vehicles. First of all, Euro 7 is set to go after the battery, and it will set standards for how much capacity a unit should have after a certain period of time. We don’t know what the parameters are yet, but think a requirement to be able to offer a certain percentage after a set number of years. The idea is that you should be able to get a guaranteed minimum range when you look at a used car. Testers are also turning their attention to the emissions produced by any car, regardless of powertrain. These emissions are not from the engine at all, as the tiny microplastics produced by a car’s tyres and brakes will also be assessed. With no CO2, NOx or other elements coming out of the rear end of the electric vehicles of the future, it is reckoned that these factors will be the biggest contributor to air pollution from road transport in years to come. Petrol and diesel cars and vans are still set to be a feature on our roads when Euro 7 comes in, so they aren’t forgotten. CO2 is not a major element of the latest proposal, though, as the path to zero CO2 has already been laid out, says the European Commission. Instead they are choosing to tighten up requirements on NOx targets and introducing goals for formaldehyde and ammonia due to their role in creating urban smog. Another notable change, as far as targets are concerned anyway, is the decision to unify the tests – petrol and diesel cars will no longer be subject to different targets and will both have to hit the same levels. This means both will have to meet the 60mg/km target for NOx for example – this isn’t a huge change as petrols already had to meet this level under Euro 6 while diesel cars had an 80mg/km target. In a move that is not likely to be universally welcomed by manufacturers, Euro 7 will require cars to come with yet more sensors. These sensors will measure a car’s emissions throughout their life, with the theory being that a car can be continuously monitored out in the real world. Theoretically this should reduce costs overall though. However, vehicles will have to comply with the new regulations for longer. Under Euro 6 they only had to meet targets for the first 100,000km (62,000 miles) and five years but this is set to double to 200,000km (124,000 miles) and 10 years. Other details will see vans and heavy duty vehicles, such as lorries and buses, subject to the same rules, albeit different targets. Testing will also add more driving conditions to the real-world element of the assessment, with temperatures of up to 45 degrees being factored in to assess performance in a hot summer. Testing is only at the proposal stage but is set to come into force from 1 July 2025 for cars, while large vans, lorries and buses etc have until 1 July 2027.

598,Watch: Ford's Supervan 4.2 takes on Pikes Peak hillclimb,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/ford/supervan/,Tom Webster,2023-11-10,Car Magazine UK,"On the 101st running of the world’s toughest hillclimb, one vehicle stood out from the rest of the pack. Pikes Peak saw Ford bring along its incredible Supervan 4.2, an van aiming to challenge the course record. Ford’s produced (somewhat over-produced) an 18-minute video charting the team’s attempt. It’s got it all – ace cinematography, interviews with slightly churlish Garys from Ford Performance, bonus Max Verstappen, and an overdramatic narrator. Taking on one of the world’s most challenging motorsport events in what looks more like an than a racer is no small feat; it’s a good thing the Supervan is no normal Transit. We first saw the high-velocity at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed, underlining this EV’s promotional purpose. It’s very much a strategic tool to underline Ford’s rapid transformation into a purveyor of electric vehicles – for passengers and cargo. Ford has form at Pikes Peak: a Model T won the very first race in 1916, lumbering 12.4 miles through 156 turns on the steep ascent of Pikes Peak in a time of 28min 3sec. Ace rent-a-race-driver Romain Dumas piloted the SuperVan 4.2 at the 2023 race, aiming to win the Open class as well as challenge the overall record. Did he manage it? Watch the video to find out… There have been a series of improvements made to the SuperVan since it was first shown at Goodwood, sufficient to warrant an upgrade in name – this is now officially the SuperVan 4.2. These are centred around optimising it for tackling the Pikes Peak gradient, with aerodynamic changes designed to deal with the high-altitude air and improve downforce. It’s also shed power as a result of this, losing 600hp in the process. The Pikes Peak improvements focus on two major areas – the powertrain and the aerodynamics. Where the original Ford Pro Electric SuperVan, to give it its full name, was powered by four motors, the 4.2 has cut this down to three in a bid to improve the power-to-weight ratio. This has seen a reduction in power from the original 2000hp, although the latest version still offers a not-insignificant 1400hp. One of the motors powers the front wheels and two sit at the rear of the vehicle. There is still no talk of an official 0-62mph time, but the original was talking about something in the region of less than two seconds. Funnily enough, the engineers haven’t gone into much detail on the range, either, but it has said the SuperVan can be recharged to full in just 45 minutes on a standard fast charger. The Pikes Peak version of the SuperVan was reworked by Ford Performance and experts at STARD Advanced Research and Development. As the event ends up 14,115ft above sea level, the van needed to be able to deal with the thinner air at the finish line. The tweaks include a new lightweight carbon-fibre rear spoiler and front splitter. The removal of one of the motors has also helped it shed weight, resulting in 1996kg of downforce at 150mph. The brake regeneration system has also been revised, as have the driveshafts, while it is fitted with magnesium-forged wheels with Pirelli P Zero racing tyres. The weight-saving sees it get a Perspex windscreen while everything unnecessary has been stripped out from the interior. The original had a selection of driving modes, which allow the driver to tailor the van for different uses. These include Road, Track, Drag, which enhances straight-line acceleration, Drift for sideways showoffs and Rally for heading out on low-friction surfaces. If that wasn’t enough then there’s also launch control, pit-lane speed limiter and an E-Boost function. We expect Dumas will be fettling all these settings to prepare it for the 1440m thash up Pikes Peak. Perhaps the most ridiculous feature is the Supervan’s Tyre Cleaning Mode that brakes one axle and allows you to send a load of that power to the other to scrub off some rubber and warm what remains. It works on both front and rear axles, too. There are a few energy-saving features too, including three-stage brake regeneration and an Eco mode. For those moments when you need to pop down the shops and want to save battery perhaps. One thing that was carried over from Ford’s more conventional vehicles is the infotainment, which is the latest Sync system, as seen in models such as the . This allows Ford to plot a route, find a charger, send data for analysis and get insights on the charging and battery. The big vertical screen has been a casualty of the weight-saving regime, though, with the cabin now much barer and more basic. The SuperVan is rumoured to be road legal, even if you might baulk at taking on any sort of speed bump or width restriction with those wheelarches and front splitter, but it’s arguably more suited to the hillclimbs of Goodwood and Pikes Peak. Dumas has already demonstrated the van at the Festival of Speed and set electric records at the Nurburgring, so it’ll be in with a good shout in Colorado. There have been three previous SuperVans, and, like this one, they have all been bonkers explorations of what can be done when you put a very fast engine under the most sensible and practical vehicle that Ford makes – the Transit. The first one appeared in 1971 and took a GT40 chassis and popped a van bodyshell on the top. For good measure, it then added a 4.0-litre V8 into the mix. The second generation came in 1984 and took a C100 Group C chassis and put a 590hp Cosworth racing engine underneath. This then evolved to the SuperVan 3 in 1994 (pictured above), which used the same chassis and a 650hp 3.0-litre supercharged V6 Cosworth engine of the type seen in F1 cars of the time. This was good for 150mph and it wasn’t afraid to do it either.

599,The latest news on the GWM Ora 03 EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/gwm/ora-03/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-10,Car Magazine UK,"This is the GWM Ora 03. It’s an electric hatchback designed to compete with the likes of the and – but it undercuts both of those cars on price. Prices for the generously equipped First Edition model will start from just £31,995. Ora is the dedicated electric off-shoot brand of the Chinese pick-up truck manufacturer Great Wall Motors. The company recently took the decision to expand into Europe – and the firm’s keen pricing appears to have struck a chord with UK motorists. Ora says it has already taken more than 6000 expressions of interest from British buyers. The 03 had its official European debut at the 2022 . ‘Funky Cat’ was certainly a brave choice for a car badge. Perhaps too brave – from January 2024, as part of a European renaming strategy the Ora Funky Cat becomes the GWM Ora 03. The first versions of the 03 to reach the UK will feature a 48kWh battery pack and a 169bhp electric motor, which Ora says has enough poke for a 0–62mph time of 8.3 seconds. Top speed is 99mph and, on a full charge, the EV will cover a claimed 193 miles. If that’s not quite enough for your daily commute, might we suggest moving a little closer to work? Or, if that isn’t feasible, just wait a bit because Ora will soon launch a 63kWh version of the 03 which will have a maximum range of 260 miles. 80kW DC fast charging is standard across the line-up, which means the 48kWh version will charge from 15 to 80 percent capacity in just over half an hour. The EV also supports 11kW AC three-phase charging and 6.6kW home charging. You would think that a £32,000 EV of this size would be relatively Spartan – but you’d be wrong. Standard equipment includes 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection and a clever traffic jam assist system that can steer, accelerate and brake the car when you’re caught in a queue. Inside, you get leatherette seats (which hardly smacks of quality, but we’ll let it slide given the price), dual-zone climate control, a wireless smartphone charger and keyless go. There’s also a pair of 10.25-inch displays – one for the infotainment system and one for the gauge cluster. They’re grafted into the same unit and mounted atop the dashboard. Early First Edition models are available in a choice of bold paint finishes and bright interior colour schemes. The standard car will come with Nebula Green paint and black upholstery, but buyers can swap this for Aurora Green paint with green interior trim or Mars Red paint with red interior trim. Funky, isn’t it? The GWM Ora 03 is sold by International Motors Group – the same company which imports Subaru and Isuzu to the UK, Ireland and Sweden. The firm has a few retailers, most of which are in Southern England, though there are some further afield. There are also several aftersales centres for servicing and maintenance. And of course, you can order your Ora 03 online too. Luke is the Deputy Editor of our sister site Parkers, but he spends plenty of time writing news, reviews and features for CAR.

600,McLaren 750S 3-7-59 edition celebrates the ‘Triple Crown’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mclaren/750s/,Jake Groves,2023-11-11,Car Magazine UK,"McLaren has announced a proper nod to its racing heritage with this: the 750S 3-7-59 edition. It’s a wild-looking art car that celebrates McLaren’s motorsport history. The 3-7-59 edition is specifically designed to honour the motorsport ‘Triple Crown’ – i.e. the fact that McLaren has won the Indianapolis 500, the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. McLaren’s MSO division have created six rolling art cars to celebrate the wins, as part of the brand’s 60 anniversary celebrations in 2023. Each car is delicately designed and individually painted with individual nods to Johnny Rutherford’s number 3 Indy 500 winner of 1974,  Alain Prost’s Monac-winning number 7 F1 car of 1984 and the 59 worn by the McLaren F1 GTR driven to a win at the 1995 Le Mans endurance race. The paintwork takes the MSO team 1200 hours on each car, with 20 paint colours used in the design, and there are some neat details inside like a special key fob, bespoke upholstery and a ‘3759’ plaque on the door sills. Naturally, only the most avid and rabid McLaren fans will be up for buying such a collectible. And six of those most avid McLaren fans have already bought the six that will be made. Interested in a normal 750S? Read on. As you might expect from how it looks, this is very much a heavy update of the 720S that came before it. Even members of the McLaren team themselves admit that. So, as you can probably tell, it’s all about marginal gains. Shane Harman, product planning manager at McLaren, guided CAR through the new 750S’s changes at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. ‘We identified three key areas that we wanted to really move the car on with. The first, as you imagine, is performance. Second was driver engagement – something where we think our competitors can sometimes do a better job than we can – and technology in the cabin.’ Harman goes on to say that, when you’re competing with the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini, it helps to make your cars as fun as possible. Not that the 720S wasn’t fun at all, mind you. On the face of it, true – you’d struggle to notice. ‘30 per cent of components are new,’ says Harman, ‘but visually, yes, it absolutely is an evolution of the 720S.’ Look closely and spot the new and cleaner front bumper, new front splitter, narrower eye socket intakes, new rear wheel-arch vents, revised rear bumper, 20 percent bigger rear wing and new service compartment below the rear screen. ‘The ‘eye socket’ headlights shape can be in body colour, which can be a bit Marmite,’ says Harman, ‘but around 30 per cent of customers are speccing them.’ Inside, as with the Artura, rockers either side of the instrument binnacle control the Powertrain and Handling modes (they’ve migrated from the upper centre of the dash), and there’s a new MCL button – which effectively acts like an individual mode ­– that allows you to set your specific parameters and access them quickly. Apple CarPlay is included, too. The headline numbers are a 30PS increase in power – from 720 to 750PS (thus the name) or from 710bhp to 740bhp. Power is increased by more turbo boost and lightweight pistons, borrowed from the 765LT. There’s also a new engine management system. As before, the 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 uses a flat-plane crank and a dry sump. It revs to a heady 8500rpm. The greater power, and a 30kg weight shaving, means even better performance than the ultra-swift 720S: 0-62mph in 2.8 sec and 0-124mph in 7.2 sec. That’s also slightly brisker to 124mph (200 km/h) than its main Maranello rival, the 296 GTB. It’s a meaningless difference (just 0.1 sec) but in the performance race between McLaren and Ferrari it may matter to some braggadocio customers. And in order to keep up with the Italians in the fun department, the 750S gains – faster steering, a shorter final drive ratio and a new brake booster to give more pedal feel and better modulation. Engine note has been improved by new engine mounts – designed to enhance the drama of the V8 at start-up and under hard acceleration – and by a new and lighter central exit stainless steel exhaust system, as on the P1 hypercar. But the 750S is still a serious performance car, too. Downforce is improved, and the aerodynamic balance has also improved, supposedly making it easier to drive fast. ‘The splitter is extended over the 720S,’ says Harman, ‘and the new rear wing gives us a five per cent increase in downforce.’ The reduced weight, to 1389kg (DIN) is due to lighter carbon-shelled seats (even lighter racing seats are available), new 10-spoke forged alloy wheels, new springs and dampers, a lighter instrument display and even lighter (by 1.6kg) windscreen glass. It’s comfortably lighter than rival Ferraris and Lamborghinis (or than the McLaren Artura). As before, the carbon fibre monocoque provides enormous rigidity, great strength – and is the single most important component in the McLaren’s featherweight credentials. A new 750S Spider is also available, yes, using the familiar (and fast – just 11 seconds to open or close) Rectractable Hard Top (RHT). As before, there is only a marginal dip in performance over the coupé: just 0.1 sec slower to 124mph. Thank the minimal weight penalty for the convertible version – just 49kg heavier. That’s due to the marvels of the carbon monocoque chassis, which needs no beefing up for the necessary strength and rigidity.

601,Volvo’s electric EM90 launches in China: is it the ultimate MPV?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volvo/em90/,Jake Groves,2023-11-12,Car Magazine UK,"Volvo’s keeping the MPV people carrier flame alive with its new EM90 people carrier, officially revealed for the Chinese market. It certainly was an odd announcement when Volvo said it would enter the MPV market earlier in 2023, but the Swedish brand says it’ll bring ‘a new standard of style to the MPV segment.’ It, like some other car makers, has noticed a growing demand for such large and opulent MPV models; it wasn’t long ago that to cater to the same market. The new EM90 likely shares an awful lot with the very cyberpunk Zeekr 09 – also only available in China. But, happily, the EM90 still looks like a Volvo. The EM90 features its own version of the brand’s classic Thor’s Hammer headlight design at the front of the rather boxy shape. On top of that, Volvo says an illuminated logo makes an entrance here – a first for the brand. At the back, Volvo says the EM90’s rear light signature is ‘inspired by the skyline of modern cities.’ Right… Naturally, though, the focus is on the interior and its space for many occupants. Volvo says its new EM90 is designed to be a living room on wheels, with CEO Jim Rowan adding that it’s ‘a car with room for life.’ The MPV features ‘top-notch’ sound insulation and road noise cancellation technologies (available soon via a software update) on board, while air suspension helps keep the ride as cushy as it can above those 19- or 20-inch aero wheels. Ambient light is everywhere in the materials, too, even in the seat backs. Those inside will also benefit from a 21-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system, an enormous 15.4-inch infotainment system and a voice assistant that features an animated avatar. For those in the back, the roof-mounted widescreen display allows you to watch movies or conduct business meetings on the move. As for specs, Volvo says the EM90 has an enormous 116kWh battery pack underneath all of that tech and upholstery, which means up to 459 miles under China’s testing procedures and claims to charge between 10 and 80 per cent in half an hour. Volvo says the EM90 features a 268bhp e-motor, good for a 8.3sec 0-62mph sprint. Volvo very cleverly says that the EM90 is for China , not China only – though the brand hasn’t confirmed where else the EM90 may be sold in the future.

602,"VW's updated ID.4 costs from £46,035",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id4/,Jake Groves,2023-11-14,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has given its ID.4 and ID.5 a very mild mid-life refresh, addressing some key criticisms owners and reviewers had of the car as well as bringing it closer in line to the latest models in the ID. range. The key upgrade is the introduction of VW’s latest 12.9-inch infotainment system. Similar to the setup in the , this has a new menu structure and, praise be, illuminated touch-sensitive sliders underneath it for volume and temperature control. The previous system had drivers blindly stabbing in the dark, often turning the stereo up to full when what they wanted was the temperature down by half a degree. To facilitate the installation of this large screen the drive selector has moved to the steering column, replacing the right-hand column stalk and leaving the left-hand stalk to control lights, wipers and indicators. There’s a new voice assistant, improved heads-up display and a premium Harman Kardon sound system. The ID.4 and ID.5 now feature the APP550 drive unit from the ID.7. This improves efficiency but also delivers a significant boost in torque, with the new base-spec ID. models having 282bhp and 402lb ft. Performance-branded GTX cars now deliver 335bhp, up 40bhp from before and endowing them with a 0-62mph sprint of 5.4 seconds. Range, meanwhile – at least according to WLTP – has been boosted by 10.5 and 11.8 miles for the ID.4 and 5 respectively. The boxy ID.4 will now go a maximum of 337 miles while the slinkier ID.5 manages 339 miles. Improved thermal management means charging speeds are also bolstered – all-wheel drive cars can now top up at 175kW instead of the 135kW previously available. The price? The range kicks off from £46,035 for the ID.4 Life Pro, up to £49,440 for the Style Pro and £53,865 for the GTX. The ID.5 represents a heftier investment – base Life trim is not available, so the range runs from £50,940 for a Style Pro up to £56,545 for a GTX Style. VW’s second ID model is here: this is the new ID.4 SUV. The all-electric people mover is . The new ID.4 is designed to be a roomier and more practical model to , with the same powertrain options underneath. If it looks familiar, that’s because it’s based off the ID Roomzz concept. Yup. It’s longer, with a longer wheelbase, than a – so VW claims it has as much room as a full-size SUV. Still a five-seater, but with a much larger boot area than the ID.3 – 543 litres as opposed to the 3’s 385. The overall look hasn’t changed a great deal from the concept; there’s almost a shooting brake-like swept-back silhouette to the car, with a bluff front end. VW says the ID.4 can be had with LED Matrix lights under its IQ.Light tagline, with 3D-effect rear lights as an option (pictured on the yellow car). The ID.4 uses the same basic platform and drivetrain as the ID.3. To ensure as much power and range as possible, the SUV has the 201bhp, 229lb ft version of the ID.3’s electric motor driving the rear wheels, kept spinning by a 77kWh battery pack. It’s capable of a 0-62mph sprint in 8.5 seconds, and VW claims a maximum range of 323 miles. Choices will expand to include all-wheel drive and a larger-capacity battery pack in 2021. Little else that isn’t already available on the ID.3. The interior concept is essentially the same, even if there’s more space inside than the hatchback; clean cockpit with a twist-action gear selector attached to the drivers’ instruments and storage cubbies in the centre console. An augmented-reality head-up display is on the options list – something VW managed to get out of the door before Mercedes did with the new S-Class – and the connected infotainment system has real-time traffic data, live updates on the state of nearby chargers and the ability to pre-condition your car via a phone app. The ID.4 will first go on sale in two limited editions: 1 and 1 Max. The 1 version has 20-inch wheels, heated seats, parking camera, two-zone climate control, adaptive cruise, navigation and more. Go for the 1 Max and that spec list is topped up by the aforementioned LED matrix headlights and 3D rear lights, 21-inch wheels, adaptive dampers, a panoramic glass roof and a powered, hands-free tailgate, augmented reality head-up display and more safety tech. Now the range has expanded, the ID.4 range starts at £41,570 for the Life trim. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

603,Production-spec Renault 5 EV spotted in app promo,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/5-ev/,Jake Groves,2023-11-15,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has confirmed that the new 5 EV will launch at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show at the end of February 2024. On top of that, a production-spec image of the small EV has been spotted during the Ampere Capital Markets Day presentation on Wednesday 15 November. The image of the production-version of the 5 EV is seen in a demonstration of a companion app for the car (pictured below), and indeed, other Renault models. It can be said that the production version, then, will change very little compared to the concept car that was first revealed in 2021. Unlike the entirely square DRLs of the concept, for example, the DRLs of the car pictured on the app screen are cut into four quarters. The removal of the glowing ‘R E N A U L T’ signature on the front of the concept is apparent, too. Luca De Meo, Renault Group CEO, confirmed the launch of the new EV at the press conference for the Capital Markets Day, as well as . Read on for the full story of the 5 EV prototype, with exclusive studio imagery by John Wycherley. ‘What’s cute about the 5 is that it oozes character, it has a soul,’ says Laurens van den Acker, Renault Group’s design director. ‘It embraces a time when cars had real character. It’s modern even though it’s inspired by the past.’ The original 5 arrived in 1972, a 3.5m-long hatchback with four-cylinder engines mounted longitudinally and driving the front wheels, a mechanical package shared with the (which is also being revived as a small electric SUV). The basic silhouette, clean surfaces and key graphics are being revived – but with a twist. For example, the original 5’s square headlamp shape is retained but as the Daytime Running Lights in the lower bumper (see below). The actual new headlamps are stretched and more trapezoidal to reflect the bigger girth of the new model, with a modern twist coming from a row of boomerang-shaped LEDs. The chunky proportions look spot on, thanks to a harmonious wheel-diameter-to-height-ratio and a great balance between width and height claims Renault design director Gilles Vidal. ‘And we enhance those proportions with the shoulders and the sculpted wheelarches, especially the rear ones inspired by the 5 Turbo’s.’ The wheels – pushed out to each corner for minimal overhangs – measure 19 inches in diameter. ‘The idea is to put into production exactly what you saw [with the concept] or even better, if we can,’ asserts the design chief. Keeping the roof low is a challenge for electric cars with a battery slab in the floor, and Vidal concedes the production 5 will be a little taller and narrower (the prototype is a little longer than a three-door Mini). ‘But our ratios are better than the competition’s,’ he claims. Former Peugeot design grandee Vidal joined Renault in late 2020, with the new 5 project well underway. Renault’s design team had pitched a revived 5 before, but had been turned down by company leaders. Then in July 2020 Luca de Meo, the former Fiat brand chief who led the 500’s revival and ran SEAT, became Renault Group CEO. He saw the model in the design studio – and six months later he unveiled the 5 Prototype as part of his Renaulution plan, saying that reviving a cult car from the past ‘can light a fire under a brand’. He’s not wrong. Retro EVs have scored both media attention and commercial success: think and , which will spawn a hotter version in 2023. The production 5 will also retain the wraparound rear lamps with their stacked, glowing red LED strips (below), and the conjoined aerodynamic vertical blade to help reduce drag. Unsurprisingly the fabric roof, with its ‘70s vinyl roof vibe, is a purely concept car touch – Renault is exploring ways to deliver two-tone colour schemes that eschew paint. The 5’s job is to replace the Twingo city car and , targeting a starting price from €20-€25,000. ‘That would cut the Zoe’s price by one-third, without incentives. That is a very good price,’ says VP of engineering Gilles Le Borgne. The CMF-B EV platform, to be used by the 5, 4 electric SUV and , is a critical ingredient. Non-EV components – such as the axles and heating and ventilation – are also shared with Renault, Nissan and Dacia’s small petrol cars. A volume of 3 million units a year provide big economies of scale. EVs on the platform get a bespoke underbody to house the nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries. Expect 40 and 52kWh packs, with the latter good for around 250 miles of range. ‘With the 5, we want a very agile, urban car,’ says Le Borgne. ‘It’s 3.92m long. To achieve that you need to limit the wheelbase of the car.’ And that means energy dense batteries, else the underbody – and costs – will grow to stow more cells. The engineers will deploy a 100kW (136bhp) electric motor to turn the front axle. It’s a Renault-designed, electrically excited synchronous motor which doesn’t use any rare earths, with copper coils for the rotor replacing magnets and thereby lowering the environmental impact. The coils help Renault control the current in the spinning rotor to conserve energy; it’s particularly efficient at high speeds. The production 5 will be assembled at Renault’s ElectriCity campus, which unites three facilities in northern France to become a hub of EV components, cars and vans. The new 5 EV will be one of 10 battery-electric vehicles to go on sale by 2025, with other models including the 4 baby SUV (below), and Kangoo zero emissions van and passenger car variant."
604,New electric Lucid Gravity SUV launches at 2023 LA show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lucid/gravity/,Jake Groves,2023-11-17,Car Magazine UK,"Lucid Motors has revealed its second-ever car: the seven-seat Gravity SUV. Covers came off the new Gravity SUV at the 2023 Los Angeles motor show, with Lucid saying it ‘heralds the dawn of a new era for electric SUVs.’ Naturally, there’s a lot of familiarity between the Gravity and in how the SUV looks, with Lucid’s clean sculpturing and shallow lighting clusters front and rear. Lucid says the Gravity’s shape allows a low drag figure of 0.24Cd. To our eyes, it doesn’t really have the same clean visual drama as the Air, but still. The interior evolves the concept of the Air here, with a huge 34-inch drivers’ display that sits proudly atop the dashboard. The ‘Clearview Cockpit’ panel blends the driver’s instruments, central infotainment display and key automotive functions in one display. Another display lower down in the centre of the dashboard is also present. As for space, the Gravity is a three-row SUV with space for seven inside. As well as the usual boot area, the Gravity also features a 227-litre frunk area. Lucid says the Gravity uses a 900V electrical architecture for super-fast 350kW charging capabilities for its battery pack which, according to CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson, is ‘little more than half the size of some of our battery-hungry competitors.’ Lucid is targeting a 440-mile range under US testing regulations and says the Gravity can sprint to 60mph in 3.5 seconds. Production is expected to start late in 2024, with a US entry price of under $80,000. We’ll update our story when we know more.

605,Farmers and estate managers rejoice: New Subaru Forester unveiled,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/subaru/forester/,Tom Wiltshire,2023-11-20,Car Magazine UK,"The wraps have come off Subaru’s latest Forester, which the firm unveiled at the LA Auto Show last week. The sixth generation of Forester doesn’t mess with the tried-and-tested formula – it’s still an unapologetically boxy , both in silhouette and in the flat-four engine that sits under the bonnet. The Forester sells in minuscule numbers in the UK, as with all Subarus – but it’s wildly popular in the US, with 2.6 million cars sold over there. It’s no surprise, then, that Subaru chose to reveal its new car at the LA Auto Show rather than a European or Japanese motor show. The Forester’s familiar five-door shape gets a new hexagonal grille flanked by sharp headlights, giving it a very similar front end to Ford’s old (non-electric) Explorer. Copper detailing on the wheels and cladding around the lower part of the body add some visual interest, while the rear sees a full-width element joining the taillights. Inside, it’s business as usual – Subaru’s retained physical gauges, but the 11.6-inch Starlink infotainment system contains the climate controls and vehicle settings. Cheaper models will make do with twin 7.0-inch screens instead. Under the skin, there’s a stiffer platform and Subaru’s storied symmetrical all-wheel drive system. Combined with X-Mode off-road settings, the Forester should retain a high degree of capability on the rough stuff. Subaru buyers worldwide expect no less. For the US, the Forester will get a 2.5-litre flat-four engine producing 180bhp and 178lb ft – just about adequate for such a large vehicle. However, a model is on the cards, and it’s this that we’d expect to be the sole offering for the UK market when Subaru launches the Forester here next year. Current UK Foresters get a faintly hybridised ‘e-Boxer’ as the sole powertrain offering. We’d expect prices to nudge north of £40,000 when the new Forester arrives in the UK, up from around £38,000 for the current model."

The hypercar track-day special was unveiled all the way back in the dark days of 2020 and is still warming up for its maiden laps next year. Bugatti has kept our interest by unveiling more details about the interior of the Bolide – and it’s as extreme as you might expect, with a confection of ultra-lightweight materials, an F1-style steering wheel and more tricks and toys for the discerning (and deep-pocketed) track-day connoisseur. You’ll climb in to the grippy seat and be tilted back, with your legs raised as if you were about to do a stint at the Le Mans 24 Hours. Pity the poor passenger who can sit beside you. Race-style winglets ensconcing the seatbacks mean you’ll likely not see them whimpering next to you. ‘Bolide’ is Italian for ‘missile,’ lest you forgot, and is the name for bright meteors that usually explode in the atmosphere. Maybe not literally, but the performance it can unleash seems that way. The 8.0-litre quad-turbo W16 makes 1825bhp and 1364lb ft – extreme numbers in themselves – sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. Bugatti claims a 0-62mph sprint is over with in just 2.1 seconds, 0-124mph is done in 4.3sec and 0-186mph is finished in just 7.3sec. Those superlative performance figures allow the Bolide to lap the Nurburgring in just 5min 23sec. Our stomachs feel quite queasy just reading those figures. In the case of the W16 used here, the turbochargers are all-new, the intake and exhausts have been opened up (compared to those on a ) and a bespoke cooling system uses air-to-air intercooling with water ‘pre-cooling’, which Bugatti claims is a better set-up than a Formula 1 car. It’s the chassis and extreme weight-saving techniques that really take the Bolide to the next level. A dry weight of 1240kg means a one metric horsepower per 0.67kg power-to-weight ratio. All screws are made of titanium and 3D-printed titanium alloy components are used throughout. Aerodynamics include firsts like a morphing air intake that bulges out at higher speeds, the wheels are made of magnesium and the pushrods in the double-wishbone suspension weigh just 100g each. The Bolide is less than a metre tall – the same height as the Type 35 racer and has folding doors like a LMP1 racer. In order for the car to race on FIA circuits, organisation-approved details like an automatic fire extinguisher, pressure refuelling, centre locks for the wheels and a six-point harness all feature. ‘In my 16 years at Bugatti, I have never worked on a more extreme concept,’ says Bugatti design boss, Achim Anscheidt. ‘It’s the very first time that my team had the freedom of creating an absolutely minimalistic design around the W16 engine, and is a project more technically driven than shaped by style.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

607,Stellantis will turn your diesel vans into EVs,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/stellantis/stellantis-to-convert-diesel-vans-to-electric/,Tom Webster,2023-11-23,Car Magazine UK,"The route to an could be made easier, and potentially cheaper, thanks to a planned scheme to turn diesel vans into electric ones. Stellantis has announced that it is launching a scheme in France that would take existing vans, strip out their engines and replace them with an electric motor and battery, giving old vehicles a second life. ‘We all know that an electric car is more expensive than a diesel car and there are some professionals who are keen to go for an electric answer, because there are zero-emission zones in big cities, for instance, but it’s expensive,’ said Stellantis’ senior vice president for commercial vehicles, Xavier Peugeot. ‘So how do they cope with the situation? By going for an E retrofit solution, which we are proposing.’ Stellantis is only offering the conversion on its medium-size vans to start off with – the Citroen Dispatch, Peugeot Expert, Fiat Scudo and Vauxhall Vivaro fit the bill therefore. The idea is that you would be able to take your existing vehicle with, say, 100,000km (62,000 miles) or so on the clock into Stellantis and it would replace the engine with a battery capable of a 120-mile range. Payload would take a slight hit, and go down to around 900kg, the firm says. The conversion is being carried out by Qinomiq, but to all intents and purposes the offer is a Stellantis one. You would take your vehicle to your Stellantis dealer, explains Peugeot, and they would manage the work. You would then be treated like any other customer when it comes to aftersales, with the company offering a warranty on the newly installed tech. Given that new batteries come with a mandatory eight-year warranty, the likelihood is that you would get similar on the conversion. Stellantis hasn’t confirmed whether you would get any sort of upgrade on the warranty cover on the rest of the van, or indeed any work would have to be carried out other than that which is necessary to remove the engine and install the electric powertrain. The cost of that installation is not insignificant, with Peugeot saying it will be around €20,000 (£17,400), although this is yet to be finalised. The price is being quoted in Euros because the initial plan is for the scheme to launch in France first, although Stellantis has said that it intends to take it to other countries ‘including the UK.’ It will kick off in France in late 2024, with a UK launch time still TBC. There would be different challenges in respective countries, such as reclassifying the vehicle as an electric van. However, this should theoretically be possible. There might even be cash available to contribute towards the cost – the London van scrappage scheme offers up to £6000 to those planning to retrofit a van. Not ready to let go of your engine entirely? The only other major scheme out there will take your existing van and turn it into a plug-in range extender. The company behind this scheme is Bedeo. Once again you are restricted to Stellantis vans, but the large ones in this instance. This is because Bedeo was the company behind the first Citroen eRelay and Peugeot eBoxer. However, Stellantis is planning to take the production of these models inhouse, so Bedeo is on the hunt for alternative routes to market. This system leaves the diesel engine but replaces the rear axle with two in-wheel motors. These are then powered by a battery that goes underneath the floor. The van is primarily powered by the battery, with a 73-mile range, but you can switch so that it is driven by the engine instead should you need to go on a longer journey. Tom Webster is our Vans Editor, as well as being the Deputy Head of the Bauer Digital Automotive Hub, meaning he has a keen focus on all things vans and automotive ownership."
608,Dacia deactivates online sales for Black Friday,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/dacia/black-friday/,Tom Wiltshire,2023-11-24,Car Magazine UK,"Budget manufacturer Dacia has shut down its online car sales portal today, as a protest/marketing stunt against . Dacia says the move will help highlight its commitment to offering good value on its model range all year round, rather than waiting for a specific day to offer the best prices and deals on its , and . Black Friday is an American import, referring to the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It typically marks the start of the Christmas shopping season, and with US-based online marketplaces dominating the internet it’s a phenomenon that’s spread to Europe too. But Dacia’s research shows that consumers are bowing out of the spend-fest this year, being sceptical of the value on offer and wanting to save money during the cost-of-living crisis. Dacia says Black Friday can lead consumers to overspend on things they don’t need, and that 70 per cent of Brits believe it’s just a marketing gimmick. Retailers will often use tricks like raising the price of an item for a few weeks before the big day to then ‘cut’ the price on Black Friday, or offering great deals on items that are limited in stock to then upsell consumers to a different product with a greater profit margin. Luke Broad, Dacia’s brand director for the UK, said: “At Dacia, Black Friday is just a normal Friday. Shutting down our online sales for the day is a bold move but it does show our commitment to being the UK’s number one car manufacturer for value. This is a way to put our money where our mouth is. Black Friday can easily lead consumers to overspend on products they don’t need – which isn’t what Dacia is about. “Today, you can relax knowing our cars are built tough and built to last, so you can take a break and buy from us tomorrow, confident that you’re getting the best value on the market”. Our proved cheap certainly can mean cheerful. Dacia’s configurator and online sales portal will be closed for the whole of Black Friday. If you’re less sceptical and do want to check out some of the best deals on offer, our consumer team has come up with some brilliant – and genuine – deals on everything from ."
609,"The first £66k Ineos Quartermaster pick-ups are built, launching in December",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_ineos/grenadier-quartermaster-pick-up/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-27,Car Magazine UK,"The new Ineos Quartermaster pick-up has gone into production and the first sturdy trucks are rolling off the line at the Hambach factory in France. European sales are due to begin in December 2023. It was first unveiled at the 2023 – and it’s the next step in the company’s plan to create a credible off-road alternative for the . Ineos has fast-tracked production of this pick-up variant to satisfy a screaming demand from markets in need of workhorse trucks, such as Australia. Ineos is making some bold claims about it, too. The brand says the Quartermaster has the ‘best off-road credentials of any mass-produced pick-up.’ Sales for Asia, Africa and the Middle East are slated for early 2024, while North American sales are next in line. Ineos says the Quartermaster is named after the British army officer responsible for the supply and distribution of provisions. An apt name for this tough workhorse… It’s based on an extended version of the ’s ladder chassis. The truck’s cabin is about the same size as the standard 4×4, but the vehicle’s overall length has increased from 4895mm to 5440mm thanks to a longer wheelbase and the load bed’s larger rear overhang. Despite this, the Quartermaster has the same ground clearance and wading capability as the Grenadier, although its breakover and departure angles are shallower. What the Ineos Quartermaster gives away in rock-crawling ability, it claws back in practicality. Like the Grenadier, it can tow up to 3500kg. Its load bed can also carry up to 760kg – and there’s enough space in the back to hold a standard Euro pallet. Space inside hasn’t altered much, either. The only sacrifice you make is a 6mm reduction in rear-seat legroom. Like the Ineos Grenadier, the Quartermaster is available with a choice of two 3.0-litre six-cylinder BMW engines – one petrol and one diesel. The petrol produces 282bhp and 332lb ft of torque, which Ineos says is enough for a 0–62mph time of 8.8 seconds. The diesel serves up 246bhp and 406lb ft of torque, allowing the truck to complete same 0–62mph sprint in 9.8 seconds. Both options have a top speed of 99mph and both share the same eight-speed automatic gearbox and permanent four-wheel drive system. Ineos is also experimenting with a hydrogen fuel cell version of the Grenadier, although whether the technology will be available on the Quartermaster is yet to be confirmed. There’s also a seven-seat version of the Grenadier in the works, based on the same extended chassis as this new pick-up. Naturally. Ineos needs to rise to the challenge of the almost infinitely customisable Defender, so it’ll sell you a waterproof canvas canopy (for £1829), a roll-top tonneau cover (at £2268) and a roof rack (for £1417). You can also choose from either 17- or 18-inch wheels in either steel or alloy. If you’re feeling flush with cash, you can also specify the Quartermaster in Ineos’s generously equipped Belstaff trims, called Trialmaster and Fieldmaster. The former is an adventure ready specification with a snorkel intake, front and rear differential locks, knobbly BFGoodrich tyres and features such as heated washer jets, heated door mirrors and a lockable interior storage box. The Fieldmaster is a little more biased towards style and comfort. It gets 17-inch alloy wheels, pop-out safari windows on the roof, heated leather seats and carpet floor mats. Both Belstaff variants of the Quartermaster pick-up are priced at £73,715.

610,Goodwood Revival 2024: now powered by sustainable fuel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/goodwood/revival/,Luke Wilkinson,2023-11-29,Car Magazine UK,"The 2024 Goodwood Revival will be a landmark event in next year’s motorsport calendar. That’s because every car in every race throughout the weekend is set to be powered by . Goodwood has sanctioned that every competitor must use a fuel that has a minimum of 70% sustainable components. Porsche has already done the proof-of-concept testing. At the 2023 Goodwood Revival, it supplied a special batch of synthetic fuel to power an entire grid of pre-1966 911 racers – and the race was just as spectacular as those powered by traditional petrol. The decision will serve as further proof that eco-friendly petrol (be it ethanol-based fuel created from crops or synthetic fuel crafted in a lab from raw carbon and hydrogen) can be used to extend the lifespan of our classic cars and reduce their carbon emissions with no adverse effects on their performance. Goodwood has an all-star roster of supporters for the change, too. Key ambassadors include Sebastian Vettel, Jenson Button and Rowan Atkinson. Atkinson is particularly supportive of the move, saying: ‘I used synthetic fuel in my racing Jaguar at Goodwood this year and found it to be not just as good as the pump petrol used previously but in performance terms, superior to it in every way. ‘It’s perhaps unsurprising that if you synthesise a fuel from first principles, you’re going to make a better product than that produced by just applying heat and pressure to some black gunk you dig out of the ground.’ Now scroll down for some highlights from the 2022 Goodwood Revival. Our round-up includes pictures from the event, insights from our reporters on the scene and some video clips of the most exciting races from the weekend. The 2022 Goodwood Revival has wrapped up after a successful weekend of high-octane historic racing, glorious September sunshine and some moving moments as West Sussex paid tribute after the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Be sure to flick through our gallery above to see plenty of captioned pictures – or carry on reading for a guided tour around the best bits of the Revival weekend. Black armbands were worn by many drivers and spectators, while the parade of priceless cars was punctuated by special memorials to the Queen – from a minute’s silence each evening to the more informal, and occasionally ursine, marks of respect dotted around the Goodwood estate. If anywhere could pull off a sensitive homage to the late sovereign in a motorsport setting, it was Goodwood – and so it proved. This remains a classy, upper-crust event with impeccable taste, a point not lost on the tens of thousands of attendees, nearly all of whom were sporting period, pre-1966 clothing. One of the first sights upon entering the main gates was the aftermath of a UFO crash – a visual gag conjuring up the post-war intrigue with flying saucers and martians. A very Goodwoodian detail that set the tone for what was to follow. In many ways it’s a metaphor for the Revival: you disappear down a rabbit hole as you pass through the turnstiles, transported to a past world, far, far away from traffic jams and broken . Goodwood woke up to a UFO crash this morning… there's whisperings that this UFO marks the 75th anniversary of the Roswell incident in New Mexico but it's yet to be confirmed. 👀 📸: Toby Whales However, look past the actors and costumes and, really, the Goodwood Revival is all about the greatest cars and people from the motorsport canon – and there was no shortage of droolworthy talent to pore over in the packed schedule from 16-18 September. A tribute to Graham Hill sparked a family reunion on track: son Damon drove some of his dad’s grand prix racers, including the 1962 championship-winning BRM, while grandson Joshua piloted the Lotus 49. F1 design legend Adrian Newey was also on hand to drive his own 49. It’s a noise that CAR magazine won’t forget in a while. Hill was one of a long list of famous drivers – professional and amateur – in attendance at the 2022 Revival: from Jenson Button and Karun Chandhok to Pedro de la Rosa and Rowan Atkinson (below), while the entry list to the Freddie March Memorial Trophy sounded like a of touring car greats. Goodwood provided a warm-up act to the Le Mans 24 hours’ 100th birthday next year, hosting the special centenary trophy and 15 drivers, who have won motorsport’s toughest challenge 44 times between them – from André Lotterer and Neel Jani to Romain Dumas and Tom Kristensen. These drivers are well versed in wringing a racing car to within an inch of its redline, yet in nursing it safely over the finish line. No wonder the racing was infrequently processional and more often spirited. The RAC TT Celebration featured some extraordinarily close encounters and the number of spins, offs and occasional smashes into the chicane (it’s polystyrene, not brick despite appearances; who knew?) proved that the Revival is a genuine A-lister on the historic motorsport calendar. Your correspondent walked the circuit for the first time and wholeheartedly recommends this pursuit – for affording new vantage points, for burning off the greasier breakfast options and for discovering fresh parts of the Goodwood estate you’ve never visited before. For instance, the members’ car park is a must-see: the sight of a posh picnic beside an impeccable 1952 Bristol (above) epitomises the spirit of Goodwood. If you need a break from the track action, browsing the public car parks is full of surprises – parked a few cars down from the Bristol was an original Mercedes Gullwing whose bonnet sported Stirling Moss’s signature… The Duke of Richmond doesn’t stand still and this year’s innovation was the Revive and Thrive zone, a kind of upmarket, retro twist on make-do-and-mend. It’s a neat way of fusing ecological imperative with the post-war spirit of giving things a second and third life (although greens would surely still question this event’s high-revving carbon footprint). It’s this attention to detail and constant evolution that has carved out a reputation for the Goodwood Revival in the motorsport – and society – calendar. This is a special event that many prefer to the vast Festival of Speed for its visceral on-track racing; yes, it remains an event with an elitist aftertaste, but the essence of Goodwood remains a strong draw to the motorsport fan and casual visitor alike. That the 2022 Goodwood Revival was blessed with dry weather and some superlative sunsets just added to the magic, tinged as it was with the backdrop of national mourning. How fitting that crowds were transported back to the heyday of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. I think that many visitors might just prefer the world then to now. Not a bad way to end day one of the . What a sunset. 📸: Scroll on to watch some of the action via the official channel.

611,New Omoda 5 SUV: China's crossover bound for UK in 2024 explored in detail,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/omoda/5/,Jake Groves,2023-12-01,Car Magazine UK,"Omoda, the car brand incoming from China, isn’t too far away from launching in Europe. The new 5 SUV, pictured here, will hit the UK market in March 2024. CAR has spoken to several executives getting the brand off the ground in Europe and the UK, and has had an up-close preview of the new Omoda 5 – the brand’s first car to launch here. Omoda is part of the Chery group, an auto maker that is currently the ninth biggest in its home market. In fact, the Omoda 5 is already on sale in China as the Chery Omoda 5 and in other markets around the world including Australia. Wenlong Liu, brand manager of Chery Automotive Company, said that Chery had been the biggest car exporter in China for two decades; last year it sold 450,000 vehicles outside the domestic market – and now it’s turning its attention to Europe. ‘We took the decision not to include the Chery name [for Europe],’ UK branding manager Matthew Upton tells CAR. ‘We wanted a fresh start for a new brand and for it to look at a younger demographic. ‘The value proposition you get from Omoda is really impressive,’ adds Upton. ‘For the money, some of the technology you’ll normally only find on much higher-end vehicles.’ The name is derived from two sources: O being associated with oxygen (yes, that bit’s a little nonsensical), and ‘Moda’ is synonymous with fashion. ‘The main thing with the brand is there’s a big focus on fashion,’ says Upton, ‘and it being a brand of stylish SUVs with a focus on design.’ On top of that, Omoda is known for adding a little extra to the ownership experience. In its home market, owners are called Omoders, with Omoda saying they get access to the ‘O-Club’ which is touted as a social platform for the brand’s community and additional experiences. The approach sounds likea blending of Nio’s lounge-like ‘House’ locations and the DS ‘Only You’ scheme designed to give you access to exclusive events. Upton says the Omoda team are still fine-tuning the European version of this, with more details to come. The new Omoda 5 is a mid-size SUV that will go on sale in March 2024, pitched as a rival to the and . It’s a compact crossover measuring 4.4 metres long. Omoda’s new 5 SUV seemingly blends design cues from the , Lexus NX and Hyundai Kona with an enormous grille that looks almost as if it’s completely flush with the front bumper, a full-width rear light bar and lots of colourful accents on the trim pictured. The EV version has a much cleaner and more modern-looking front fascia, including angled new lights. Inside, meanwhile, has a clean design including a high-mounted infotainment screen and places to put your phone similar to Tesla’s range of cars. There’s a single, wide panel mounted atop the dashboard that incorporates the car’s digital instrument cluster and a central touchscreen, and the infotainment system includes a voice assistant that has the ability to operate certain functions like the sunroof without touching a button. Two specifications of the Omoda 5 will be launched: Comfort (for £24,000) and Noble (for £27,000). Our studio preview of the 5 SUV gave us an opportunity to experience the interior quality and technology first-hand on an Australian-spec Omoda 5 Noble. Overall, the interior quality is reasonably strong – the buttons on the steering wheel feel solid and the interior touch points all feel well screwed together. The large amount of gloss black panelling on the centre console will smudge fast, however. The screens operated quickly and, while the graphics aren’t of the utmost resolution, the system felt reasonably logical to use (unlike, for example, the tech on the MG 4). Elsewhere, rear space is reasonable – even for a 6ft tall adult – as it the boot space offered. The brand says the 5 SUV will be available with a 1.6-litre petrol engine that develops 187bhp and 203lb ft, and an EV version is coming too. Omoda says the 5 has already achieved a five-star Euro NCAP crash test rating, and features driver assistance tech like adaptive cruise, lane keep assist, auto high beam and more as standard. The petrol Omoda 5 doesn’t appear to have very competitive efficiency figures; the combined headline figure stands at 31.4mpg and CO2 emissions of 170g/km are surprisingly high, too. Omoda says the electric model will launch at the same time as the combustion-powered one in March 2024. Prices haven’t been announced yet, but we expect the 5 EV to close in on £30k in the UK market. Aside from a revised design that goes for aerodynamic efficiency at the front, the Omoda 5 electric model will feature a 61kWh battery pack and a 201bhp electric motor that drives the front wheels. Omoda says the 5 EV is capable of a 0-62mph sprint in 7.6 seconds, and claims a 280-mile range. A hybrid version of the Omoda 5 is expected to launch by the end of 2024. After that, Omoda is going full steam ahead by launching more models in Europe and the UK in the years to come. Over the next three years, Omoda will launch the 3 (a small crossover that’ll rival the Ford Puma and Vauxhall Mokka), the 7 (which is described as ‘Tucson or Sportage-size’ by UK director, Victor Zhang) and the 9 (which will be a similar size to a Range Rover Sport or Porsche Cayenne). Zhang also says the aim is for Omoda to provide different powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, where it suits the car and market best. ‘We think the UK, for example, is still not fully ready for EVs at the moment,’ he says. ‘I know there’s the 2030 ban coming, but ICE cars will still play a big role for the next one to three years. ‘Other Chinese brands like Ora, Nio and BYD are focusing entirely on EVs for Europe, but we’re doing a whole range – which makes us different from the rest.’ In a step away from various initiatives from various car makers to introduce agency models, subscription services or online sales, UK branding manager Upton confirms that Omoda will sell its cars via traditional dealerships where you can still buy a car in the building. 50 are planned for the UK. ‘We’ll have them in the most popular cities first,’ says Upton, adding that ‘it will be a traditional dealership initially once we’ve set up.’ Omoda is also going to offer a seven-year warranty on its new cars, and include an eight-year battery warranty.

612,New classic! Genesis reveals X Gran Berlinetta concept at the Gran Turismo World Finals,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/genesis/new-node/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-12-02,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Genesis X Gran Berlinetta VGT, an extreme concept car that continues to stretch and expand the young brand’s bold design language. Unveiled at the 2023 Gran Turismo World finals in Barcelona, the X Gran Berlinetta VGT is a Vision GT car, and therefore commissioned especially for use in However according to Genesis’ North American design team, it firmly establishes design cues that’ll be seen on future production cars. It does, and that’s because despite having a relatively blank canvas for the project, Genesis’ North American design team wanted to distil the very essence of the brand into the new concept. And what’s the essence of Genesis you ask? Well, it starts with the badge: the crest forms the shape of the grille, while two lines across the logo’s wings end up forming the car’s unique light signature. ‘Whenever you see a Genesis on the road, people immediately recognise it by the two line signature with the headlamps, and then the two line signature with the rear of the car as well,’ said John Krsteski, Senior Chief Designer of Genesis Design North America at the unveil in Barcelona. ‘So two lines; that’s the way we always approach our design ethos.’ With that in mind, the X Gran Berlinetta VGT takes the now customary Genesis grille and turns up to eleven, while glowing, parallel lines wrap around the front and the back of the car just like the brand’s current production models. The X Gran Berlinetta VGT is of course very different to a G70, but Genesis is keen to point out its ethos of ‘athletic elegance’ is just a bit more front and centre in this car. Take the Genesis’ styling cues to one side, however, and the X Gran Berlinetta VGT features classic lines and volumes more reminiscent of something from Italy – and that was deliberate, too. ‘In the beginning of this project, we were heavily inspired by cars from the 60s specifically Grand Touring Cars,’ said Tony Chen, Exterior Manager of Genesis Design North America. ‘These vehicles really accentuate a long dash to axle distance, and that means the cabin is really pushing and really accentuating power from the front. It’s then swept back where you have a really long hood.’ ‘The vehicle is really reduced in frontal mass, so it cuts through the air very efficiently. You’ll see in the shoulder [what] we call this the parabolic gesture. And this also is seen amongst our production line-up, where the line or the volume starts up high and then drops.’ Inside, the X Gran Berlinetta VGT is a hybrid of race car and luxury saloon, so although you can see the shape of the monocoque, it’s all padded with neat diamond-stitching. Like the brand’s production cars, the concept uses fine, almost jewellery-like details in its switchgear – once again adding to the luxurious feel. To keep the gaming theme going, Genesis’ interior designers have take inspiration for the steering wheel from the PlayStation’s iconic controller. Unlike some of the more extreme Vision GT cars (take a look at the , for example), the Genesis concept isn’t beyond the realms of reality. For a start it’s not powered by hydrogen or supercapacitors; the Genesis design team says it’ll use hybrid power in a way similar to most hypercars. In fact, a lot of the possible engineering has been sense-checked at least. Polyphony Digital’s rigorous approach to its Real Driving Simulator has forced the Genesis team to seriously think about the engineering under the X Gran Berlinetta’s flowing curves. ‘That was all a great learning experience for us because we didn’t realise the level of intensity that goes into every detail of performance,’ admits Krsteski. ‘We went back and forth even with our engineering teams internally to gather all this information to make sure that it was all going to go into the game. So, the cars, when they do perform, they’re performing exactly as [they would].’ Like many contemporary hybrid supercars, it’ll use a compact V6 – in this case front mid-mounted in the car’s swooping bonnet. Genesis has picked a redline of 10000rpm, and quotes a maximum output of 1071hp and 986lb ft of torque. 859bhp and 790lb ft of that would come from the ICE, while the remaining 198bhp and 196lb ft will come from a Yasa e-motor. Probably not, though Genesis’ design team is adamant that aspects of it will be recognisable in future production cars. ‘The crest grille, the two lines, the parabolic gesture – these are all kind of resonating in the line-up today and will be further enhanced in the future,’ revealed Chen. ‘So once we develop this kind of design strategy, the team really has their own take on how to cook with those ingredients: that’s what you see [in the concept] and what you’ll see in trickling future production vehicles. Think of this Vision GT car as a canvas to stretch, prod and exercise Genesis’ design ethos and you’re pretty much there.

644,Renault Solarbay tech: the smart sunroof that lets each row pick their tints,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/renault-solarbay/,Tim Pollard,2024-01-15,Car Magazine UK,"One of the eye-grabbing features on the new h and are their Solarbay panoramic glass roofs. Developed by glazing specialist Saint-Gobain Sekurit, it’s a moonroof that lets each row of passengers choose their own tinting, simply at the flick of a switch or a voice command using Google Assistant. Hot day at the beach and the kids are frazzled? Parents can make the glass almost opaque for row two, while still bathing in sunshine up front. Driving near Heathrow and the children want to spot planes while the grown-ups want some privacy? Renault Solarbay can do that, too, as well as offering full transparency or shade to both rows. When you activate the opacity mode, it looks like a wave passing through the nine glazing segments. They’ve not missed a trick in making this tech stand out from the crowd. When you switch the ignition off and park up, the glazing automatically dims for greater security and to minimise solar gain. At start-up, the sunroof will default to its last setting, meaning the driver won’t constantly be adjusting the level of tint. CAR magazine has tested the roof in action and been impressed how quickly the glass reacts to commands. It uses a technology called AmpliSky that sandwiches glazing with a layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs), whose chemical structure reacts to an electric current, changing the opacity of the glass one panel at a time. The glass roof saves 30mm of headroom, as there is no need for a mechanical rollerblind and it’s 8kg lighter, too. Crucially, 50 per cent of the roof is made from automotive glass waste and 90 per cent of it can be recycled at the end of its life. Anne-Chloé Kort, the product lead for the Renault Scenic E-Tech said: ‘At Renault, we are innovating non-stop to improve life on board our vehicles and comfort standards for our customers. Solarbay is a smart, high-tech feature that does exactly that.’ Tim oversees the digital teams that bring you CAR magazine and Parkers, our car-buying sister website.

645,Subaru Crosstrek launched: the XV’s heavily reworked successor,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/subaru/crosstrek/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-01-16,Car Magazine UK,"The has been around for a long time, now. It hit the UK market in 2017 – and Subaru’s reluctance to give the car a comprehensive update in that time meant it was starting to feel a little long in the tooth compared to newer rivals such as the and . But Subaru has finally recognised this – and it hopes a swathe of updates ushered in with the rebranded Subaru Crosstrek will drag the XV back into the race. The firm has given the SUV a thorough styling overhaul, loaded it with some fresh technology and dropped the car’s XV branding in favour of the new ‘Crosstrek’ nameplate. The revised and rebadged Subaru Crosstrek is available to order in the UK now. Prices start from £34,290 for the most basic Limited specification, which makes it around £6000 more expensive than the most basic . However, Subaru justifies the added expense by offering the Crosstrek with more equipment and a hybrid powertrain as standard. Quite a lot. There are new front and rear bumpers, slimmer LED headlights and extra body cladding that extends further up the car’s flanks. The entry-level Crosstrek also comes with a fresh set of 17-inch alloy wheels as standard, while the range-topping Touring model features 18-inch alloys. Subaru has made some aerodynamic improvements, too. There are new air outlets on the trailing edge of the front wheelarches, which the company says allows turbulent air to escape from the arches, helping to reduce front-end lift and improve stability. There are similar outlets on either side of the rear bumper that are designed to reduce body sway by releasing the air pressure that would otherwise get trapped behind the panel. The changes continue inside. The 2024 Subaru Crosstrek’s dashboard and interior trims will be familiar to XV owners, but Subaru has made a few targeted upgrades that it says make the Crosstrek easier to live with. The biggest changes are some extra sound deadening and a new front seat design that Subaru says makes the car more comfortable over long distances. There’s also a new 11.6-inch portrait infotainment system, with support for wireless and . However, the larger screen occupies more space on the dashboard, eating into the space that was previously occupied by the climate control panel. That means the car’s physical knobs and dials have been replaced by a new climate control menu on the touchscreen. Like the XV, the Crosstrek is powered by one of Subaru’s 2.0-litre four-cylinder mild-hybrid boxer engines – but the new car’s engine is less powerful than the one it replaces. It produces 134bhp and 134lb ft of torque, compared to the 148bhp and 192lb ft you got in the old XV. Subaru says the Crosstrek has a 0–62mph time of 10.8 seconds and a top speed of 123mph. As before, the engine sends drive to all four wheels through a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The range-topping Touring model also has a feature that allows the driver to cycle through eight fixed gear ratios using a pair of paddles mounted behind the steering wheel. Subaru is really leaning into its rugged branding with the Crosstrek. Every version of the car is fitted with hill descent control and an off-road driving setting called X-Mode, which adjusts the car’s throttle response, gearing and stability control system to make the car easier to pedal over rough terrain. Touring models also feature hill start assist and a further two driving modes, called Intelligent and Sport. Every version of the Crosstrek is fitted with the latest version of Subaru’s Eyesight Driver Assistance Technology. The company says the revised safety suite has a wider field of view and improved software, allowing it to recognise pedestrians and bicycles sooner. The technology also now notifies the driver of any hazards faster and, if necessary, will apply the brakes to avoid an accident. Other standard safety equipment includes automatic emergency steering, blindspot monitoring, lane-keeping assist and rear cross-traffic alert. Plus, there’s an interior monitoring system that’ll issue the driver with a warning if it recognises they’re distracted or fatigued behind the wheel.

613,Toyota’s Urban SUV concept previews a boxy baby EV for 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/urban-suv-concept/,Jake Groves,2023-12-03,Car Magazine UK,"Toyota’s developing a rival to the growing small electric SUV market, and this Urban SUV concept is our first look at its new contender. The Urban SUV Concept has a tall, boxy small crossover shape that’s designed to make it a relative companion to the – even if it looks a little larger than the ‘self-charging’ baby SUV that’s already on sale. ‘It has a compact footprint and high driving position that many customers in urban environments are looking for,’ says president and CEO of Toyota Europe, Yoshihiro Nakata. ‘This model gives us a strong indication of what will be a key contributor to our BEV sales here in Europe.’ Performance specs are sparse, but Toyota has confirmed that production version will have two different battery sizes available and offer front- and all-wheel drive versions. ‘This will be our electric offer for the B-SUV category that is growing more and more in the European market. We have had success with the Yaris Cross, and we don’t intend to leave anything to the competition when it’s about battery electric vehicles,’ says Andrea Carlucci. We expect the new model to launch under Toyota’s current electric car nomenclature, meaning it could bear the name bZ2 or bZ2X (as the bZ3 already exists for the Chinese market). The resulting production car will rival the likes of the and , as well as the and upcoming Ford Puma EV. Interested? If you are, you won’t have to wait long: ‘we plan to reveal the production version of this car in the first half of next year,’ says Nakata. After something smaller? Toyota’s not venturing into the supermini EV market like Renault with its upcoming 5 EV for now, according to Carlucci: ‘This will be the most compact BEV car, at least for a while.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

614,Toyota FT-3e concept shows off next-gen EV platform,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/ft-3e/,Jake Groves,2023-12-03,Car Magazine UK,"After its initial reveal at the , Toyota has revealed more details about its new FT-3e concept. The FT-3e is designed to bring balance to the EV force, being as light and as sparing on natural resources as it can be while providing the best range possible. The new, rather boxily-designed four-door crossover is designed to show the overall future of Toyota. The brand says the FT-3e is 17cm longer, 14.5cm wider and 5.5cm lower than the that’s currently on sale, and features neat details like animated lighting and displays in the doors that can be used to preview the state of battery charge. Beneath the skin, Toyota says the FT-3e’s architecture is the same as that of the , as well as the – two cars that were also revealed during the 2023 Tokyo show. ‘Every part of the company will benefit from this new platform, and that includes GR,’ says Toyota’s chief branding officer, Simon Humphries. Toyota also aims to bring a range of battery sizes and chemistries to market over the next few years using this platform as a base. The brand’s new range of batteries includes a Performance version due in 2026 which has twice the range but is 20 per cent cheaper than the one seen in the bZ4X. After that, a cheaper lithium iron phosphate battery will have a 20 per cent better range and a 40 per cent cost reduction compared to the bZ4X. After that, Toyota promises that solid state batteries are on the way. ‘We have made a technological breakthrough that overcomes the long-standing challenge of solid state battery durability,’ says Toyota’s European Vice President, Andrea Carlucci. ‘A method for mass production is currently being developed and we are striving for commercialisation in 2027-2028 with production capacity of several tens of thousands of vehicles.’ Production models using this battery technology, as well as new-generation software will arrive from 2026.

615,Morgan goes electric! XP1 three-wheeler EV revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/morgan/xp1/,Piers Ward,2023-12-06,Car Magazine UK,"Is no tradition sacred? Morgan, previously the last remaining bastion of string-backed driving gloves, has built an three-wheeler case study, the XP1. Flat-capped moustaches will be bristling at the affrontery. Although it’s only a prototype at this stage and has no confirmed on-sale date, this isn’t some vapourware concept car as it’s based around the same chassis and aluminium monocoque as the . Plus, the XP1 actually works – a prototype has been up and running for three months now. EV deniers should be aware it weighs less than 700kg, despite carrying a 33kWh battery under the bonnet (roughly the same size as the Mini Electric’s). That’s only about 60kg more than the ICE version of the 3, which should help keep the doubters at bay. It’s no surprise that the company has been so rigid on what it feels is a key aspect of a Morgan, whether it’s electric or not. Matt Hole, Morgan’s CTO, told us that ‘Morgan is so unique. We had to keep it lightweight – we’ve borrowed the bits we need and then integrated them within the 3. Just like we’re integrators in our ICE cars, so we will become integrators in EVs.’ By picking and choosing parts that fit its strict brief of keeping the weight as low as possible, the firm can combine them with a Morgan twist to create the eccentric cars it’s known for. To that end, the electrical gubbins comes from various companies. The 100kW motor from UK firm iNetic is mounted in the transmission tunnel and still powers the single rear wheel, while the inverter is from a Chinese OEM. There are four power levels on the car, indicated by the number of chilis showing on the dash, and unlike on some EVs, the noise from the electrical motor is completely natural. There’s no synthesised sound, which is doubly handy because the XP1 doesn’t have any speakers to pump it through. Suspension development work is ongoing as Morgan continues to experiment with what feels correct. As Hole points out, ‘we’ve tried to make it engaging. There aren’t any gears, so we’ve tried to make it drive in such a way that it [the XP1] tunes your brain to do other things as you’re driving along. It needs character.’ As it stands, the spring rates and front dampers have been tweaked to cope with the extra weight from the batteries. The additional heft has also meant the steering geometry has been changed, to give the car more bite when turning into a corner and because there’s more urgency to the torque delivery in an electric car. That additional torque is also why Morgan hasn’t yet settled on a rear tyre configuration for the XP1. The unusual front tyres remain the same as the Super 3 (they’re such a unique design it’s difficult to change them), but the rear’s spec is still up for debate. The bodywork remains largely the same as the Super 3 – it’s identical behind the rear hoops – but changes to the front, underfloor and fitting of wheel spats means the drag coefficient has dropped by a third, from 0.65 to 0.42Cd. Modelled with CFD, the XP1 has unique side blades with asymmetric holes carved into them to better deflect air along the sides of the car. A completely flat underfloor helps reduce drag, while the ICE car’s vents on the leading edge of the bonnet are filled in by LEDs that light up to show when the car is charging. It’s unlikely the prismatic battery arrangement would see production (Hole favours a cylindrical set-up) and in an ideal world the motor would move back from the transmission tunnel, be rotated through 90 degrees and then placed into the space where the bevel box normally sits. It would save on gearing costs and be a far more efficient way to manufacture the car. Thanks to Morgan’s new toolchain development software – used on the XP1 and also rolled out across all its upcoming cars – Hole knows this is a solution that works. But budgets being what they are, the XP1 prototype is stuck with the cheaper solution of the motor in the transmission tunnel, certainly during this development phase. Although it’s yet to be confirmed for production, the XP1 is vital for Morgan as electrification becomes ever more dominant. Currently, the Wiltshire firm uses a mix of Ford and BMW engines, but as those manufacturers commit to a far more electrified future, their powertrains will become increasingly rare commodities. ‘This gives us a future opportunity for our powertrain changing,’ according to Hole. Given the time and effort that Morgan has expended on the XP1 and the way that the wind is blowing in general, you’d be a brave person to bet against it appearing in production form before too long.

616,Second tuner fined in 'pop bang' exhaust crackdown - what it means for you,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/illegal-exhaust-modifications/,Graham King,2023-12-06,Car Magazine UK,"A second car tuning company as been fined for adding a ‘pop bang’ ECU remap to a car, in a prosecution brought by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The case follows a similar ruling in December 2023 that effectively rendered pop bang remaps illegal. The earlier case resulted in tuning companies being obliged to inform customers if a modification would make their car illegal for use on the road. Onyx Performance of Reading met that obligation, however the judge ruled it had failed to make sure that the car would not be used on the road. Until now there had been no such obligation in law but, under the UK’s system of case law, the ruling sets a precedent that other tuning companies will now have to abide by. Onyx Performance removed the catalytic converter and exhaust silencer from an unnamed vehicle before adding a ‘pop bang’ remap to the ECU. While the company advised that the car would not be road legal as a result of the modifications, they did not make sure the car wouldn’t be used on the road. Removing a cat and silencer is illegal and results in an MOT failure. DVSA also tested the noise levels of the car and found it to be over the 75dB legal limit. Having been convicted at Reading Magistrates Court, Onyx Performance was ordered to pay a fine totalling £5,800. The judge hearing the case ruled that there is a ‘heavy burden’ on tuning companies to make sure that a car fitted with modifications that make it illegal for road use will only be used off-road – on a race track, for instance. According to the DVSA’s report on the case, businesses ‘must take all reasonable steps’ to explain whether or not a particular modification is road legal. If not, they must ‘satisfy themselves that the vehicle is not to be used on public roads.’ The report adds: ‘Vehicles need to leave their premises on a trailer if changes made render the vehicle illegal for road use.’ West Yorkshire firm AET Motorsport was found to be openly advertising decat exhaust systems and noise-generating ECU remaps. The DVSA’s Market Surveillance Unit engaged the company to carry out the modifications to a . Once the modifications were completed, the car was found to be generating 77dB of noise – 2dB over the legal limit. Remember that an increase of 1dB effectively represents a doubling of the volume of noise. At no point did AET Motorsport point out the illegality of the modifications. The company was fined over £7,000 by Kirklees Magistrates Court. After Onyx Performance’s conviction, DVSA’s head of the Market Surveillance Unit, Chris Dormand, said: ‘We’re delighted with this outcome which, combined with a similar recent prosecution, highlights that companies must act within the law. ‘Modifications designed for off-road use are illegal on our roads and businesses will be held accountable. DVSA takes this activity very seriously and, where appropriate, we will prosecute companies who offer [these] services.’ Roads Minister, Guy Opperman, added: ‘Everyone knows that horrific sound, when exhausts go pop and bang in the street, and cracking down on companies that fit these modifications shows our commitment to ensuring that Britain’s roads remain among the safest in the world.’ It’s not just companies that risk being fined. The Department for Transport is currently trialling ‘ ’ that detect when a car is exceeding the legal noise limit. Police can issue a £50 on-the-spot to drivers of such cars. If the trial proves successful, noise cameras are likely to be rolled out across the UK. The DVSA also told CAR: ‘To stay road legal, consumers will need to choose a [modification] supplier who has the correct knowledge to keep them within the law.’ Graham King is a Senior Staff Writer on the Bauer Automotive Digital Hub, working across CAR and Parkers"
617,"New 442bhp Mercedes-AMG CLE53: double turbos, six cylinders, all-wheel drive",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/cle-amg-53/,CJ Hubbard,2023-12-06,Car Magazine UK,"So, there’s now an AMG version of the – the half-way house replacement for both the C-Class Coupe and the E-Class Coupe. Given its general straddling persona, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to discover this is a CLE 53 model, meaning it dodges the four-pot bullet but doesn’t quite get the kick in the arse an AMG V8 would deliver. Still, 442bhp isn’t too shabby. And you do get ‘double turbocharging’ (more on that in a minute), ‘fully variable’ all-wheel drive and . As standard. An evolved version of the 3.0-litre straight-six turbo – previously the M256, now the M256M. As well as changes to the combustion chambers, inlet and outlet plumbing, piston rings, injection and conventional turbocharging, this engine range boasts a second electrically driven turbo for increased response. Hence double turbo. Compared with the original, boost pressure goes up 0.4 bar to 1.5 bar overall and there’s further assistance from the 48v mild-hybrid system – worth 22bhp and 151lb ft on its own. Once Mercedes has done all the calculations on this, in addition to the 442 horse there’s 413lb ft in total available 2200-5000rpm, with overboost to 442lb ft on demand. Top speed is the usual electronically limited 155mph and the official 0-62mph time is 4.2sec. Compared with the standard car, the AMG CLE53 has a 58mm wider front and 75mm wider rear track width, and the flared bodywork to match. Those are 20-inch wheels, should you be worried. AMG Ride Control combines steel springs with variable damping, where the ‘damping on each wheel adapts to the current driving situation and road conditions.’ This happens regardless of driving mode, but you do also get a choice of Comfort, Sport and Sport+ settings. Mercedes-AMG claims a ‘noticeable differentiation’. You also get three-stage speed sensitive steering, plus rear-wheel steering with a standard maximum operating angle of 2.5 degrees. The AMG 4Matic+ all-wheel drive system is fully variable, with a heavy rear bias, especially when the ESP Sport setting is engaged. And obviously when you’ve gone to the shops in – although you’ll need an optional upgrade to the AMG Dynamic Plus package to access that. The whole character of the car is managed by the AMG Dynamic Select system, which has five basic programs – Slippery, Comfortable, Sport, Sport+ and Individual – and a further AMG Dynamics levels. These are Basic, Advanced and Pro. Most of this can be controlled directly from the steering wheel using the dedicated AMG buttons. These look gimmicky but are neat to use, based on our experience in other models. Reasonably. You get high-tech digital headlights, lots of interior screens, ambient lighting, and leather. There’s still scope for a tasty upgrade, though, courtesy of the UK-specific Pro Performance package. This combines the AMG Optics package – a bunch of visual mods that make the exterior more aggressive and the interior more racy – and the AMG Dynamic Plus package. As well \as Drift Mode, the latter also includes a Race setting and active engine mounts to achieve tighter agility. No official announcement on that just yet, but with the over £60k this sizeable coupe is surely going to be another £20k above that. At least.

618,BMW M Mixed Reality: we drive a BMW M4 on track using just a VR headset,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-m-mixed-reality/,Tim Pollard,2023-12-11,Car Magazine UK,"Ever played a video game so realistic you felt you were genuinely there? Modern screenplay is so fast, so visceral, so accurate that the gap between reality and the virtual world is narrower than ever. We should know: we hammered a around an empty race track, with the driver’s head shrouded in a VR headset, and lived to tell the tale. It’s all part of BMW’s M Mixed Reality, a rolling lab testbed that lets you drive a real M sports car around an empty test track using artificial gameplay, harnessing the latest advances in processing power, eye-tracking and ultra-high-definition goggles. Sounds like a Mario Kart skunkworks, but there’s a serious edge to the project: BMW wants to push the frontiers of virtual, augmented and mixed reality – to understand how human beings interact with digital interpretations of the reality around them. Today’s will be overhauled in 2025 with the new full-width Panoramic Vision stepchange, and M Mixed Reality shows what could follow later in the decade if current technology trends become more extreme. And it is pretty extreme. I warily don the 12-megapixel Varjo XR-3 headset and before we set off follow an installation process that’s like an eye test at the opticians, staring at dots and symbols while the mixed-reality goggles learn to track my eye and head movement. It’s so they can accurately project the gameplay into a photorealistic line of sight. Once ready, I set off and immerse myself in a digital world that could be taken from an arcade machine. It’s the BMW M Mixed Reality metaverse, a race track with barriers, bridges and bonus tokens to collect as we drive round. It’s a route that’s been carefully selected to work on the huge concrete apron we’re actually driving around. Reassuringly, there’s a safety co-pilot sitting next to me in case I hallucinate, pass out or go rogue. It’s all very odd. I quickly learn to trust the high-fidelity imagery, yet I’m driving a real M4, its turbocharged flat six snarling and thrusting us around the empty apron. It’s insane, great fun and – when my live stream temporarily crashes (‘You turned your head too far to look at the door mirrors’) – rather disturbing. It dents my confidence and I don’t drive quite as briskly after that. BMW says the data is helping it design future in-car AR and VR systems. But I’d rather just enjoy an M4 without any goggles, thank you very much. BMW uses state-of-the-art Varjo XR-3 mixed reality headsets, offering photorealistic imaging and the widest field of view on the market. Cost? Around £6700 a pop. Munich is working with gaming specialist Epic Games to develop the M Mixed Reality software. It processes ECU data on the car’s movement, yaw and position. Two M4s are devoted to the project, nicknamed Bonnie and Clyde by engineers. They are mechanically stock, barring an extra brake pedal for the safety co-pilot riding shotgun. The fact that we’re still here to write the tale suggests that it does work, yes. BMW M Mixed Reality is an extraordinary fusion of the virtual and physical worlds. It’s uncanny how quickly we learned to trust the system – until a momentary blip in gameplay dented our confidence.

619,Hyundai and Kia reveal new snow chain tyre technology,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/hyundai-kia-integrated-snow-chains/,Seth Walton,2023-12-11,Car Magazine UK,"Snow chains may not be common or essential for drivers in the UK, but if you’d like some extra help to fortify your , Hyundai Motor and Kia have come up with a solution. The two manufacturers have unveiled a new snow chain-integrated tyre technology that can deploy alloy snow chains at the push of a button to maximise tyre traction in snowy or icy conditions. The tyres feature radial grooves at regular intervals around their outer edge. Housed within these grooves are shape memory alloy modules that are compressed under normal driving conditions so they don’t touch the road and the tyre surface is smooth. However, when road grip is compromised by heavy snow, an electric current will activate the modules so they protrude out from the surface of the tyre, providing more contact with the road surface to maximise traction. Once back under normal conditions and with the electric current switched off, the shape-memory alloys will return to their original position, retracting back into the tyre grooves to reinstate a flush surface. The technology is patent pending in South Korea and the United States. Hyundai Motor and Kia haven’t announced an expected release date, or even which cars the tyres may be found on, but they have declared their plans to mass-produce the tyres after more research and technological development. If successful, it’ll remove one of the fiddliest jobs known to motoringkind: the application of snow chains (above). ‘This innovation, which will hopefully be introduced on Hyundai and Kia vehicles someday, reflects our commitment to turning advanced technologies into real-world solutions that benefit customers,’ said Hyundai’s head of advanced chassis development, Joon Mo Park. ‘We will continue to develop technologies that enhance safety and convenience of our vehicles and bring value to our customers.’ Seth is a former staff writer across all our modern motoring titles, including CAR magazine and Parkers.

It’s less of a boulevardier and more of a quarter-mile bruiser, judged on its spec sheet. It mixes the well-known 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbo engine (hardly known for being a sluggard) with the E Performance plug-in hybrid powertrain for a devastating set of performance figures: It’s enough to make the AMG SL 63 S E Performance the most powerful and fastest Mercedes SL of all time. The rear electric motor is rated at 150kW, enough for an extra 201bhp kick at the back wheels, delivered through a mechanical limited-slip differential. Fully variable AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive monitors traction at the rear axle and feeds drive to the front wheels when required. If this is all a bit much, read on for more background on the rest of the SL range. Mercedes unveiled its all-new SL convertible back in 2021. Along with introducing a whole new platform, fresh technologies and a back-to-basics design, the latest 2+2 SL is designed to hark back to an era of grand touring prowess the brand has been famous for. ‘We wanted to come back to its origin,’ AMG boss, Philipp Schiemer tells CAR. ‘The original SL was a sports car, with the ongoing generations it was a symbol for a lot of people.’ ‘You can only imagine the original SL’s impact. We wanted to take the car back to those roots,’ adds AMG’s chief technical officer, Jochen Hermann. ‘If you think about the 300SL in the ’50s – how far ahead of its time it was – we wanted to take this car back to that and give it a clear character. The last two SLs were something in between being sporty and a cruiser.’ This new-generation SL, then, also aims to bridge the gap between Mercedes-Benz and its AMG skunkworks. ‘AMG took over this car,’ says Schiemer, ‘combining the sportiness and driving dynamics of AMG with the comfort and luxurious appeal of a Mercedes-Benz.’ At launch, the SL was available with two power outputs of AMG’s 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8: the SL 55 and SL 63. Both have all-wheel drive (though this system doesn’t have a rear-drive mode like an E63) and a nine-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The SL 55 (in white) produces 469bhp and 516lb ft, sprinting to 62mph in 3.9 seconds and topping out at 183mph. The hotter SL 63 (in red), meanwhile, develops 577bhp and 590lb ft, good for a 3.6-second 0-62mph time and a top speed of 196mph. The SL added plug-in hybrid variants under the Mercedes-AMG E-Performance banner – the same powertrain that’ll also underpin the upcoming AMG C63. That comprises a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine mated to e-motors and a battery pack. Mercedes says it’s designed to be as much as a grand tourer as it is a sports car, given the heavy involvement of AMG. So, along with the V8 power from launch and standard all-wheel drive, the new SL can be had with rear-wheel steering and, for the SL 63, AMG Active Ride Control. That’s a semi-active hydraulic anti-roll system designed to kill body roll through the bends – something usually reserved for top-heavy SUVs. The SL 63 can also be specified with an electronic limited-slip differential for the rear axle if you specify the AMG Dynamics Plus pack. ‘Sporty does not have to mean rock-hard dampers,’ explains Hermann. ‘It can mean precise and predictable. You don’t need to make a car uncomfortable to achieve these things. With all the systems and modes, including the e-diff, the power split across the axles and the rear-wheel steering, you can make this car very sporty with the push of a button,’ claims Hermann. Active aerodynamics (which Mercedes calls Airpanel), including a pop-out rear spoiler inset into the top edge of the tailgate, and the new MSA platform the SL is underpinned by comprises an aluminium space frame with optional active engine mounts (part of the aforementioned AMG Dynamics Plus pack). Choosing a soft-top over a tin-top reduces weight and complexity, too, and Mercedes says it takes just 15 seconds to raise or lower at speeds up to 37mph. The new roadster has also taken a leaf out of the S-Class’ book with its new portrait infotainment setup running the latest MBUX functionality. Yet Mercedes calls it ‘hyperanalogue’, given the split off, square driver instruments leaving little to distract you. We’ll be the judge of that… Mercedes’ new SL went on UK sale in the first months of 2022. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

621,New Renault Scenic E-Tech electric priced from £41k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/scenic-e-tech/,Phil McNamara,2023-12-14,Car Magazine UK,"The Scenic people carrier is being reborn as the all-electric Renault Scenic E-Tech SUV, unveiled at the 2023 . An entirely predictable development given the MPV’s plummeting popularity: the Scenic was pulled from UK sale in 2019, and almost all its peers have been axed too. Nonetheless the revamped Scenic promises to be faithful to the original’s philosophy at least, putting its occupants first with lashings of space, safety and wellbeing features. It also has a profound and welcome focus on sustainability. Read on for full details and specs of the all-new Scenic E-Tech electric, which arrives on the UK market in May 2024, priced from £40,995 for a Techno E-Tech 100% electric 220hp Long Range. As with the original, the Scenic is the Megane E-Tech’s bigger brother (indeed the groundbreaking compact original MPV was named Megane Scenic initially). That means it shares the electric hatchback’s CMF-EV platform and entry-level 60kWh battery, though it’s 269mm longer and has 99mm more steel between the wheels to boost cabin space. It’s a handsome, nicely proportioned car with its wheel-at-each-corner stance and low roof, more than 30mm lower than the original domed Scenic and many contemporary SUVs. That’s no mean feat for an EV with a two-tier battery under the floor. While a shimmering grille full of Renault diamond shapes is eye-catching, it’s reminiscent of Peugeot’s approach, as are the vertically arranged, half-rhombi LEDs. Surely no coincidence given Renault poached the Lion brand’s design director Gilles Vidal two years ago – and this is his first Renault. Customers can pair six exterior paints with a black or grey gloss roof for a two-tone effect; roof rails are standard. Range-enhancing aerodynamic features including air ducts under the day-running lights (DRLs), flush door handles, aerodynamic wheel covers and a squared-off bumper to sever the air to reduce drag. The interior design feels more exceptional, starting with the packaging. The Scenic is compact at 4468mm long, but the boot is a decent 545 litres while its 2784mm wheelbase makes for rear knee- and headroom that vies for class-leading, Renault claims. That headspace can be enhanced by a high-tech glass roof, called Solarbay, whose polymer dispersed liquid crystals can switch from opaque to clear at the touch of a button. Voice commands can also tell it to shade only the front or rear sections. Eschewing a motorised sun blind makes it more compact and saves up to 8kg, says Renault. Half of all Scenic glass is recycled, and 90% can be reused at the end of the vehicle’s life. The original Scenic’s fold-down trays were a novelty in the ’90s, and the new Scenic echoes this with a neat rear armrest. This has fold-out stands for the kids to watch movies on their tablets, which it can also stow or power from two USB-C ports, alongside two drink holders. Upmarket Iconic trim features linden wood trim picked from sustainable forests, and ambient lighting can adjust in step with humans’ circadian rhythms to reflect the time of day (cool during sunlight, warmer at night). Among the 50 apps in the Google-driven infotainment is SongPop, where occupants try to name that tune by tapping answers on their smartphones. And when you park up to charge, powered seats can shift into a relaxed position and perform massages, while the infotainment, ambient lighting, USB chargers and glass roof remain powered for 45 minutes. The Scenic will be available in standard or long-range spec. The latter has a more powerful motor turning the front wheels, punchier DC charging capability and quicker acceleration. See the full specs for both models below: 60kWh 125kW (168bhp) and 207lb ft 9.3sec 261 miles 130kW DC 87kWh 160kW (215bhp) and 221lb ft 8.4sec 385 miles 150kW DC Using the Google-based journey planner (which even considers wind direction and speed to predict electricity consumption), the Scenic will pre-condition the battery as it approaches a charging stop. Renault claims the car can recover 50kWh on a 150kW charger in 30 minutes. All Scenics have a heat pump to efficiently warm the battery or the cockpit, boosting range. Renault also says revised cell chemistry makes the battery 6% more power dense than the Megane E-Tech’s. The CMF-EV platform, which underpins the Nissan Ariya and Megane E-Tech, is a decent foundation. It’s light compared with many peers – the 87kWh bigger battery Scenic weighs 1842kg – and it has a multi-link rear axle which should help with comfort and dynamics. The Scenic has the same steering ratio as the Megane EV, which should translate into quick responses. Renault claims the chassis resists roll well, so that should deliver an agile car – which sounds somewhat at odds with the occupant-oriented focus… There are four levels of regenerative braking – from zero to 3, optimised for one-pedal driving in town – which should deepen the driving experience. Renault has also worked with French electronica composer Jean-Michel Jarre to create the external pedestrian warning and welcome sounds. Google him, those under the age of 40… Many manufacturers have been talking a good game on recyclability, and here comes Renault’s statement production car. Almost a quarter of the Scenic’s mass comes from recycled parts – and 90% of materials can be used again at the vehicle’s end of life. For example, some 37% of its chassis and body metals are second-life materials. Bio-sourcing is also important: the dashboard cowling and steering wheel cover are partly plant-based, and plastic from recovered bottles constitutes part of the floor mats and seat fabrics, for example. There’s no leather in the car whatsoever (Renault will phase out hide options entirely by 2025), and the motor and battery also forego rare earths, lessening their environmental impact. The Scenic has the obligatory big screens, including a 12.3in digital driver’s binnacle. This replaces the trad, circular speedo with a speed line which changes colour according to power demand and vehicle speed. And with the increasing gamification of driving and regulation’s ever-tightening grip on safety, the Scenic introduces a ‘Safety Coach’. This uses the front camera and sensors to monitor driving style including distance from the car in front, cornering speeds and even the use of indicators. Digital feedback will be similar to cars’ eco-driving coaches, but mission creeping into more aspects of driver monitoring. Renault sees it as a boon to assist inexperienced drivers, others may find it deeply intrusive. It’ll be linked to the speed warning system (mandatory on new cars from July 2024), one of 30 driver assistance systems on the new Scenic. All this is in keeping with the model’s roots. The 1991 concept that presaged it was called S.C.E.N.I.C. (Safety Concept Embodied in a New Innovative Car) and its innovations included drowsy driver monitoring and a driver’s airbag. The new car reminds us that safety is eternally important – and that the modern SUV is the new MPV for the 2020s."
622,Polestar 3: hands-on with the new electric SUV targeting Porsche's Cayenne,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/polestar/3/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-12-18,Car Magazine UK,"The Polestar 3 launches in summer 2024, priced from £79,900 in the UK, or £1009 a month if you prefer to lease it. That’s the for the Launch edition of the SUV with Pilot and Plus pack bundled in, but cheaper, more accessible versions will arrive in due course. The Polestar 3 is, as the name suggests, the third in Polestar’s burgeoning family and can’t arrive soon enough. The 1 was a rare-groove plug-in hybrid coupe and the company has had to make do with the 2 electric saloon since launch in 2020, going on to sell 24,000 in the UK. Now the Swedish EV specialist is about to launch a barrage of new bodystyles, with two new electric crossovers due in 2024 to broaden its range signficantly. The new electric SUV claims a pretty sizable range and potent performance figures, and first models are expected to arrive at the end of the second quarter in 2024. Expect a UK launch in May/June. ‘The Polestar 3 is a powerful electric SUV that appeals to the senses with a distinct, Scandinavian design and excellent driving dynamics,’ says Polestar boss (and mustard-coloured blazer enthusiast) Thomas Ingenlath. The Polestar 3 takes a lot of design inspiration from the , including the angular double-blade headlights (likely in an effort to differentiate Polestar more from Volvo’s Thor’s Hammer light signature) and aerodynamic wing blades at both the front and rear of the car. CAR has pored all over the first 3 in the UK and the aero addenda really stands out. Crouch down at the front of the car and you’ll see slats on the leading edge of the bonnet, channeling airflow – and the same at the rear by the integrated roof spoiler (see below). It’s an unusual shape and its scale is hard to judge from photos. It’s big at 4.9m long, yet much lower than you might expect. For a car positioned roughly against the SUV, it’s significantly lower-riding and more coupe-like. As well as offering a crucial SUV to the world markets, Polestar says the new 3 will ‘take our manufacturing footprint to the next level,’ according to Ingenlath, ‘bringing Polestar production to the United States.’ So, as well as being built in the Volvo Group’s facility in Chengdu, China, the brand plans to also build the Polestar 3 at Volvo’s Ridgeville plant in South Carolina. The 3 is launching with one powertrain variant for now, which Polestar calls the Long Range Dual Motor model. A Performance Pack can be applied for some extra goodies, too. As standard, the Long Range Dual Motor Polestar 3 features a sizeable 111kWh battery pack and two permanent magnet synchronous motors, developing 483bhp and 620lb ft of shove, good for a five-second 0-62mph time and a top speed of 130mph. Only one battery will be available at launch. Spec the Performance Pack and power rises to a heady 510bhp and 671lb ft, shaving 0.3sec off the 0-62mph sprint. Regardless of whether the Performance Pack is applied or not, Polestar says the 3 is capable of up to 379 miles of range. Sounds to us like a useable 300 miles to us. The Polestar 3 has adaptive self-levelling air suspension as standard with active damping, as well as four-piston Brembo brakes. On top of that, the 3 has dual-clutch torque vectoring technology on the rear e-motor that’s evolved from its initial application on . A one-pedal driving mode is available, and the 3 can drive with just one motor active for better efficiency under low loads. As well as a power boost, the Performance Pack tweaks the geometry for the air suspension, adds unique alloys and accents the car in Polestar’s now traditional gold. As for charging, the Polestar 3 can swallow up to 250kW at a time at a DC fast charger, or up to 11kW via an AC outlet. Yes, to the point that it might end up stealing the ’s thunder a little here. A standard Polestar 3 has five radar sensors, five cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors inside and out, and the ‘Smart Zone’ where most of the forward facing equipment lives is placed where a grille would be on a combustion engined car, is something Polestar is proud to call a design cue all of its own. The Polestar 3 runs on the same platform as Volvo’s new electric flagship so, like the EX90, the 3 can be had with a suite of safety tech (including LIDAR and eye-tracking cameras) that really moves the needle. The LIDAR sensors, supplied by Luminar, as well as thee more cameras and four more sensors are part of the Pilot Pack that will be available to order on Polestar 3 models from the middle of 2024. Sensors inside also include ones to check you haven’t left anyone inside (Hyundai and Kia do this, too, but only by remembering you opened the back door before driving off in the first place) and the tech is also linked to the climate control system, which Polestar claims is designed to stave off heat stroke or hypothermia in extreme temperatures. Elsewhere, the 3 benefits from Google’s Android Automotive OS – which originally debuted on the Polestar 2. Here, it’s evolved from the version initially seen on the jacked-up fastback Polestar’s been selling for a couple of years now, and the brand promises over-the-air updates and the potential for new software to be applied or installed after the car’s been built. That OS displayed via a 14.5-inch touchscreen in a remarkably clean, low-fuss interior – just like . The brand also says it’s been careful with its material choices, including ‘animal welfare-certified’ leathers and wool. We’ve sat in the Polestar 3 and can vouch for the quality on offer and the space. Don’t fret about the low roofline: it is a supremely roomy and spacious interior, with ample space in both rows of seats and a huge boot. One niggle: the demisting and window heating buttons are positioned high up on the roof by the cabin lights. We’re not sure this is compatible with Swedish ergonomic best practice… You can order a Polestar 3 now from £79,900 for the long-range dual-motor version launching first, with the optional Performance Pack adding £5600 to the price tag. Much like the Polestar 2, expect the 3’s drivetrain options to expand over time, likely with single motor versions stretching the range downwards. It’ll land in the UK in late Q2 2024. The Polestar 3 made its dynamic debut at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed (above), where we discovered that the Swedish brand could add a hotter version of . Polestar engineers aren’t ruling out a BST version in due course. Short for ‘Beast’ and originally given to a one-off Polestar 2 for CEO Thomas Ingenlath, the BST package made it to series production on the saloon and the uptake surprised Polestar. Two series of BST-spec Polestar 2s have been produced and sold (accounting for 270 and 230 sales), and CAR understands the suits in Gothenberg are now weighing up a similarly bonkers version of the more practical (but still powerful) Polestar 3. You only have to look at the mythical status of similarly silly cars such as the Volvo T5 R – a distant ancestor of the Polestar 3 – to see why this could work. Or, if you prefer something more contemporary, Hyundai’s decision to release an , also shown at Goodwood. There appears to be a strong market for incredibly quick but practical electric SUVs, and the Polestar brand could cash in with a 3 BST. The Polestar 3 BST hasn’t been confirmed, let alone the specs, but we can look towards for an idea of what to expect. Polestar engineers tweaked the car’s handling, fitting new Öhlins two-way adjustable dampers, an aluminium strut bar and also added software-based performance upgrades. Nice work, if you can get it, but we suspect that cheaper, powerful models will move the needle further. We’ll update this page once we hear more details of the Polestar 3 UK range in due course. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
623,New McLaren GTS revealed: GT replacement is a mild update,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mclaren/gts/,Jake Groves,2023-12-19,Car Magazine UK,"McLaren has announced the new GTS supercar. It’s the replacement for and comes complete with a whole raft of tweaks, revisions and updates to the package – even if you likely won’t be able to spot them on first glance. It’s all about aero tweaks for the new GTS’s bodykit over the GT. The front valance below the headlights has been updated with new sculpted air intakes, and taller air scoops over the rear wheelarches also feature. Both are desgiend to help air flow and cooling, and are coupled with the GTS’s new rear diffuser. Adaptive suspension and ceramic brakes are standard, and the GTS launches some new wheel designs. The GTS uses McLaren’s carbonfibre MonoCell II-T carbon tub and a lightly updated version of its perennial (and very good) 4.0-litre twin-turbo, flat-plane V8. McLaren says the engine benefits from revised ignition timing and ‘increased camshaft torque achieved by more aggressive combustion phasing.’ Power is boosted to 626bhp (14 more than the GT), even if the 3.2sec 0-62mph time and 203mph top speed remain the same as the outgoing GT. McLaren has put some focus into widening the scope for personalisation, too, with new upholsteries and plusher materials inside, as well as more bits of technology to soften and gild the supercar experience that little bit more. McLaren says the new GT is available to order now, with the first deliveries coming in 2024. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

624,Think-different Tesla Cybertruck will also double up 'as a boat' – Musk,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/cybertruck-electric-pick-up/,Tom Webster,2023-12-19,Car Magazine UK,"Another day, another outlandish claim for the Tesla Cybertruck… This time maverick boss Elon Musk revealed the electric pick-up will soon have an option to turn it into a boat – with the ability to traverse 100m of water. In his tweet, Musk claimed the Cybertruck would need little alteration, apart from upgrades to the door seals. We are going to offer a mod package that enables Cybertruck to traverse at least 100m of water as a boat. Mostly just need to upgrade cabin door seals. The Tesla Cybertruck went on sale to US customers earlier in December 2023, amidst some startling claims for the pick-up: it is priced from $60,990 (£48k) in America at launch, the fastest Beast range-topper can sprint from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds and the truck is ‘bulletproof’ to withstand .45in and 9mm calibre small-arms fire. New details emerged at the winter 2023 , which was watched by 3.7 million users on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and now rebranded by owner Elon Musk. After a long and painful gestation, it’s the first time we’ve seen the definitive production versions of the Cybertruck. The new truck is built at Tesla’s Giga factory in Texas and Musk called it ‘the most unique thing on the road.’ He’s not wrong. Two powertrains are offered at launch: an 845bhp tri-motor set-up based on the Model S Plaid’s powertrain or a twin-motor, all-wheel drive version offering a more modest 600bhp. A cheaper, lower-spec rear-wheel drive Cybertruck is planned for 2025. Tellingly, many of the original claims have been watered down and prices have gone up: The production Tesla Cybertruck has stayed true to the angular nature of all the set-square, wedge-profiled prototypes seen in the build-up to launch. Its bodywork is unusual: the ultra-hard stainless steel is claimed to be resistant to dents and long-term corrosion – and the doors are bulletproof to light arms fire. Moreover, the glazing is shatterproof and can survive a baseball thrown at 70mph (above, though the design lead’s shot at the unveiling can more politely be described as a gentle lob). Sceptics might have doubted if the long-delayed Cybertruck would ever materialise in production form, but the #1 production milestone in July 2023 was a step in the right direction ahead of the customer handover on 30 November 2023 (below). Cybertruck Delivery Event The fully electric, apocalyptically-styled flatbed has a much lower range than originally quoted at launch pre-pandemic in 2019. Musk had promised a range of more than 500 miles, but that has shrunk considerably to 340 miles in production versions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, since the Cybertruck weighs a portly 3107kg. Yes, over three ! Speaking of weights, the Tesla pick-up does have a high towing capacity. Cybertruck will tow 4990kg and the flatbed can take 2.5 tonnes, with enough space for 4ft x 8ft materials, according to Tesla. Musk admitted at the summer 2023 annual shareholders meeting: ‘Cybertruck is a hard truck to make. You can’t just use conventional methods of manufacturing. We had to invent a whole new set of manufacturing techniques in order to build an exoskeleton car rather than an endoskeleton car so it is clearly not trivial, but we are making good progress on that.’ He recommitted to the plan for a 2023 launch. ‘Sorry for the delay. We’re finally going to start delivering production examples of the trucks later this year and the product is, if anything, better than expectations. Cybertruck is the car I will be driving on a day-to-day basis.’ The Tesla pick-up will join the , , and in the company’s line-up. UK distribution remains unclear. The company hasn’t taken orders for the truck outside of America for a while and it sounds like it’ll have its hands full meeting demand just from the US. Musk said earlier in 2022 that the company has ‘more orders of the first Cybertrucks than we could possibly fulfil for three years after the start of production.’ The Cybertruck was first revealed in November 2019, at which point Brits could put down a £100 fully-refundable deposit. The page where you could do this is no longer accessible in the UK, although US customers can still place a deposit. The truck has already been delayed several times, with aimed-for production dates of 2021 and 2022 both pushed back. The new Tesla Cybertruck is the wedgiest pick-up truck we’ve ever seen, like a break-out from the props department of . The radically styled Cybertruck takes everything knows about electric cars and applies that knowledge to the booming pick-up segment. The flatbed is made from composite material and is claimed not to need a liner. With clever V2G bi-directional charging, the Cybertruck can power tools or another EV from sockets in the loadbay (below). No wonder – the battery in the Tesla Cybertruck is huge, Tesla’s biggest yet at 123kWh. Still not enough range? Then consider the ‘range-extender’ battery upgrade, which packs an additional 50kWh cells into the loadbay. This new Tesla is ‘designed to have the utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car,’ according to Musk. So it’ll tow a boat, horsebox or caravan up to six tonnes, and carry a greater load capacity than most leisure-oriented pick-ups sold in the UK. That payload of nearly 1.6 tonnes fits in a covered loadbed of 1.9 metres – and the steeply raked cover means your cargo will be out of sight of roaming eyes. Tesla naturally showed off an all-electric branded ATV quadbike to fit in the boot. What these first official photographs show is the sheer size of the thing; it dwarfed even tall adults at its debut, and appears considerably taller than a Ford Raptor. The Cybertruck is also bristling with storage cubbies; Tesla quotes 100 cubic feet of lockable compartments, including the ‘vault, frunk, and sail pillars.’ Even the glass is armoured to resist break-ins (though it famously smashed during the world debut, to Musk’s horror). It’ll go off-road – an important consideration in this rough ‘n’ tough marketplace – and the air suspension adapts 10cm up or down for extra ground clearance or to adjust when fully laden. Perhaps the most startling aspect of the Cybertruck is its wedge-shaped styling and origami stainless steel construction: it’s more Italian styling house circa 1973 than California 2023. Just goes to show Musk’s endless appetite for surprising the car industry and turning automotive conventions on their head. Musk claimed in a tweet that the pick-up was inspired by the Lotus Esprit from the James Bond franchise (not the first time he’s referenced this particular slice of Giugiaro-designed wedge). The ‘ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel’ bodywork is designed to be tough, easy to manufacture and echo the shiny cool of a DeLorean; it was also developed in conjunction with Musk’s SpaceX team to be one of the most durable materials known to mankind. The interior of the Cybertruck packs space for five adults, with the three-abreast seating in the front row dropped for production. It’s a typically minimalist Tesla cabin, with barely any switchgear visible at all in this first cabin photograph (below). Note also the radically futuristic steering wheel that has more in common with arcade games than 2023-spec road cars. The touchscreen is a huge 17-inches in size, as Tesla ramps up its digital touchpoints and tries to stay ahead of the likes of Ford, which now deploys suspiciously familiar 15in screen on its . As with many things to do with Elon Musk, this is a rolling news story – and we’ll be updating this article as we learn more about the Tesla Cybertruck, which will challenge pick-up EV upstarts such as the all-electric . Tom Webster is our Vans Editor, as well as being the Deputy Head of the Bauer Digital Automotive Hub, meaning he has a keen focus on all things vans and automotive ownership."
625,Will synthetic fuel save the internal combustion engine?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/what-is-synthetic-fuel-efuel/,Graham King,2023-12-19,Car Magazine UK,"Like it or not, the world is inexorably shifting away from the internal combustion engine to battery electric cars. From 2035, no new ICE-powered cars will be sold in the UK, but there will still be millions of cars on the road that need petrol and diesel for many years after that date. And that’s just the everyday, common or garden stuff. Classic cars, race cars and other more interesting machinery will hopefully be around in running condition for centuries to come. After all, the skills and knowledge needed to keep the very earliest cars running is out there, nearly 150 years after they were first built. And there’s no reason why they shouldn’t still be usable in another 150 years. The same goes for any other car. So long as there’s liquid fuel available to power those cars. It’s likely that petrol and diesel will remain available from fuel station forecourts for decades to come – no major countries are proposing an end to its sale. But, as the proportion of ICE-powered vehicles on the road reduces, the economic viability of selling fossil fuels on a large scale will dwindle away and petrol and diesel pumps will become a rare sight. Liquid fuels will almost certainly remain available in some form, though. And we’re already getting an insight into what that form might be with the synthetic fuels and eFuels – also known as sustainable fuels – that are already on the open market or being used in specialist applications. eFuels are made from man-made hydrocarbons, whereas synthetic fuels use more natural substances. Such fuels are being enthusiastically embraced by the motorsport and classic car worlds. Individuals and organisations in those worlds are keen to push development of the technology in an effort to head off the possibility of being regulated out of existence. That’s despite their vanishingly small CO2 footprint, but the lack of knowledge among lawmakers means many see draconian restrictions as a real possibility. Right now, synthetic fuels can only be bought in the UK from a very limited number of outlets, but a manufacturer has plans to set up forecourts. If that proves a success, others will surely follow. Here’s a rundown of the current biggest players in the synthetic fuels market, what their fuel actually is, where it’s being used and how you can get some for your car. German company P1 Performance Fuels has made a big impact since it was launched in 2018. It has been the exclusive fuel supplier to the World Rally Championship since 2022 and made a splash at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed. There, it provided the fuel for the ex-Mansell Williams and ex-Senna McLaren owned by Sebastian Vettel (pictured below) and driven by him up the hill. P1 has also supported the Gumball Rally and is an official partner of the Silverstone Festival. P1’s eFuel is made by converting alcohols into synthetic hydrocarbons. The energy needed to produce the fuel comes entirely from renewable sources including wind, solar and hydroelectricity. No fossil fuel is used in the process and most of P1’s products have no ethanol content, which can damage rubber and plastic components in an older car’s fuel system. It’s a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning that no engine modifications are needed to use it. An extensive range of fuel blends is available from P1, for a variety of road and race applications. UK distributor Nemesis Ltd. was appointed in August 2023, though a proper retail network has yet to be established. For now, you can only buy by the barrel direct from the P1 Fuels website. It has reached pumps at a single location in Berlin and the company has ambitious plans to make its products available from a network of fuel stations across Europe in the coming years. UK-based Coryton hit the headlines in 2021 when it supplied fuel for the Prodrive-run BRX Hunter cars that contested that year’s Dakar Rally, a relationship that continues. But Coryton’s motorsport activities go much further, the company working at every level from Formula 1 down to the grass roots. It also has a close relationship with Mazda UK, supplying fuel for the Japanese brand’s heritage fleet. Indeed, Coryton has thus far mostly focused its UK efforts in the classic car field. 80 per cent of Coryton’s SUSTAIN fuel is made from agricultural waste including straw and crops that can’t be used for animal or human consumption. The remaining 20 per cent consists of high-grade fossil fuel and a stabilising additive. Ethanol content is just one percent. Again, only renewable energy is used to make the fuel. Coryton claims it reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 65 per cent compared with fossil fuels. Like P1, it’s a drop-in fuel that requires no car modifications to use. Two blends of Coryton SUSTAIN are available, one developed for motorsport applications and one aimed squarely at classic car drivers. The latter is currently available from Motor Spirit at Bicester Heritage and The Splined Hub near Peterborough has also signed up as a stockist. There’s a pump at Bicester and you can also buy by the barrel. Perhaps the best-known sustainable fuel project was inaugurated by Siemens Energy and Porsche in 2020. Based in southern Chile, the Haru Oni project aims to produce 55 million litres of eFuel by 2024, and 550 million litres by 2026. The fuel will largely be used by Porsche’s experience centre fleets, vehicle development programs and motorsport activities. It may be available for general sale at some point down the line, as well. The fuel is made by separating water into hydrogen and oxygen, then the so-called green hydrogen is combined with CO2 scrubbed from the atmosphere to create methanol. That’s then turned into useable fuel via the ExxonMobil-licensed Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) process. Production is powered by the abundant wind energy available in southern Chile. In March 2023, the EU announced an exemption to its 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars that will allow ICE-powered cars capable of only running on eFuels. It isn’t clear how that will work in practice, but it will likely only apply to very low volume cars. At the moment, the UK isn’t planning on following the EU’s lead, either. The point is that fossil-free fuels are highly unlikely to grant mass market ICE cars a stay of execution. Not least because producing them is incredibly energy inefficient. The vast amount of wind energy generated at the Porsche-Siemens plant in Chile would be much more efficiently used if went straight into an EV’s battery. eFuels are also very expensive – you’ll currently pay well over £3.00 per litre for P1 and Coryton fuel. That will come down over time but it’s unlikely to ever dip below the £2.00 per litre mark that would make them a viable replacement for petrol and diesel for all vehicles. But eFuels and synthetic fuels will play a vital role in keeping interesting, old cars going for decades, even centuries after petrol and diesel is no longer available.

626,Chinese brand Jaecoo announces UK launch with J7 SUV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jaecoo/j7/,Jake Groves,2023-12-20,Car Magazine UK,"Jaecoo, a brand from Chinese automotive group Chery, has officially confirmed it will launch in the UK. Its first new car will be the Jaecoo 7: a large SUV that will arrive on our shores in the summer of 2024. The new off-road-focused car brand will naturally only sell SUVs in the markets it enters. Along with the UK, the Jaecoo brand has already confirmed it has entered the South African, Russian and Filipino car markets and will likely launch in others outside of China. The Jaecoo name is a portmanteau, derived from the German word ‘Jäger’ (meaning ‘hunter’) as well as the English word ‘cool.’ Jaecoo is a brand designed to tread the line between luxury and off-roading. Given it’s part of the Chery Group, Jaecoo is closely tied with fellow fledgeling Chinese car brand Omoda, which will also launch in 2024 in the UK with . Both car brands will use SUVs that area already on sale in China as Chery models. In fact, the Jaecoo J is badged as the Chery Tansuo 06 or Explore 06 in China. Despite its bluff and squared-off design that implies a large size, the Jaecoo 7 shorter front/rear but wider than a . Jaecoo is priding itself on the 7’s off-roading capabilities, promising an intelligent all-wheel drive system as well as sophisticated plug-in hybrid technology. While performance specifications aren’t known yet, Jaecoo says the 7 features a 540º camera system (which means a more traditional 360º parking system, as well as software that allows you to ‘see through’ the car’s bonnet), as well as a head-up display and promises plenty of other luxuries. The Jaecoo 7 will launch in the UK in the summer of 2024. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

627,Cybersecurity and car thefts: how are car makers responding?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/cybersecurity/,Graham King,2023-12-21,Car Magazine UK,"New European Union rules regarding the cyber security of cars come into effect in July 2024 and are causing a number of manufacturers to discontinue popular models. Porsche announced that sales of models will end in EU countries early in 2024, despite remaining on sale elsewhere in the world until the end of 2025. The and are also being discontinued. All three cars are over ten years old and, though they’ve been updated many times, meeting the new cyber security regulations would require an entirely new electronic architecture that can’t be shoehorned in. Known as UNECE WP.29, the measures are part of the wider General Safety Regulations 2 package that comes into force on 1 July 2024. It requires that all new cars sold in the EU – and the UK – be fitted with 20 safety technologies including automatic emergency braking, speed limit recognition and an emergency lane keeping system. WP.29 is an opt-in within GSR2 that the UK hasn’t yet signed up to, thus petrol Macan models will remain on sale here throughout 2024. But the vast majority of cars sold in the UK meet EU standards by default and it’s likely only a matter of time before WP.29 is adopted in UK law. The regulations stipulate that all cars sold in the EU must be hardened against 70 potential cyber security risks – a number likely to increase over time. Those threats can be roughly grouped into hacking and physical system breaches, both intentional and accidental. They cover the entire life of a car as well, from the design office to the scrap yard. Cars face many security risks. WP.29 is particularly concerned with hacking of car manufacturers’ ‘back-end’ computer systems and servers, corrupted over the air updates being sent to cars, and theft of vehicle users’ personal data. Hacks and breaches could also result in withdrawal of service for a particular system and intellectual property theft. It may finally address keyless car thefts, in which a car’s key fob is remotely cloned, as well. Range Rovers have proven particularly vulnerable, to the extent that many insurers now refuse to cover the cars in London, where the problem is most prevalent. As car insurance is a legal requirement in the UK, Jaguar Land Rover has had to resort to offering its own insurance product to affected owners. Manufacturers have to submit an exhaustive cyber security risk assessment and risk management plan as part of the type approval process. Certification of the so-called cyber security management system lasts three years, at which point manufacturers will have to go through the whole process again. Any changes to the car’s hardware or software have to be certified, as well. Failure to comply with the regulations can result in a fine of €30,000 for every non-compliant vehicle sold. Aside from a few rather ancient models being withdrawn from sale, it’s not yet clear how car manufacturers will meet their obligations under WP.29 and how that will affect car owners. But we can extrapolate some possibilities from the wording of the regulations. Among the concerns expressed is the possibility of USB and remote devices being used to corrupt a car’s systems or steal user data. That could cause issues for connecting phones and other devices. It’s possible that an approvals process will be built into a car’s infotainment system that assesses the security of each device before allowing it to connect. In addition, each user may be required to set up a personal profile that includes their devices. Of course, most cars have multiple users over the course of their life and WP.29 seeks to ensure that there is no possibility of those users accessing each other’s data. It’s possible that each user will have to log into the car with a pin number, or some other form of ID. If could also complicate the process of selling or hiring a car because there could be an onus on someone to delete previous users’ information. The concerns around third-party devices accessing a car’s systems could have a knock-on effect in car maintenance. Garages may have to show that they have their own cyber security measures in place to be allowed to work on hardened cars, and there could be issues around having the right diagnostic equipment. The regulations don’t exclude the possibility of carrying out aftermarket modifications but do state that any mods must be restricted to a designated area within the car’s computer systems. That could restrict the kind of modifications that can be carried out. For instance, ECUs may be locked out to prevent IP theft and monkeying around with things like a car’s emission control systems. Manufacturers remain responsible for their car’s protection from cyber security threats in what’s called the post-production phase. That’s from the day production of a model ends until the day the very last example is scrapped. While most cars become very rare in the decades after they’re discontinued, there are very few that become completely extinct throughout the world. It’s entirely possible that manufacturers won’t be keen on supporting their cars effectively in perpetuity. We could, therefore, see manufactures buying back and scrapping old cars so they don’t have to keep supporting them, once the paperwork submitted for WP.29 certification expires 10 years after the end of production. Over the air updates might make the process easier, as the manufacturers could be able to see how many examples of a particular model are left and where they are. Having said all that, we won’t know for sure how meeting the WP.29 regulations will work in practice until they come into force on 1 July 2024. And even then, the long-term implications won’t become clear for some years yet. We’ll keep tabs on the situation, though.

628,Next-generation Apple CarPlay revealed inside Aston Martin and Porsche cars,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/next-gen-apple-carplay/,Curtis Moldrich,2023-12-21,Car Magazine UK,"Apple, along with Aston Martin and Porsche, have given us some new glimpses of the latest-generation Apple CarPlay infotainment overlay. The new-generation display is expected to launch in 2024, with the two premium brands being the first two to utilise the new software. ‘The integration of the latest state-of-the-art technology combined with a bespoke intuitive interface is paramount to creating the ultimate Aston Martin customer experience. We look forward to sharing more as we work together with Apple to bring the next generation of CarPlay to Aston Martins in 2024,’ says Marco Mattiacci, Aston Martin’s global chief brand and commercial officer. The new, much more expanded CarPlay was originally announced at the 2022 WWDC event – short for World Wide Developer Conference. The new software was shown during a segment about iOS, the brand’s mobile operating system that also runs on the iPhone and iPad. A lot. Until now Apple CarPlay has been contained within the main infotainment screen, and only data – such as navigation and music – has often spilled over to the instrument cluster. It also hasn’t controlled anything outside of smartphone-related functions such as navigation, music or podcasts. In contrast, the new software sees Apple CarPlay’s look and feel extend well beyond the touchscreen to every area of the car. It’s essentially an iOS takeover. The next-generation of CarPlay will therefore have greater integration with the car’s existing systems, with features such as the radio and climate control now controllable within the Apple ecosystems. On top of that, you’ll now see Apple’s software tap into vehicle data to provide everything from speed, fuel level, operating temps and more. And because this is Apple, you’ll be able to change the look and feel of the display, and even add widgets. For the last few years we’ve seen big tech gradually move into the automotive space and on the whole it’s been great for customers – but a double-edged sword for brands. Great on less premium cars, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay offers a strong range of features with a familiar UI and plug-and-play functionality. However, the inclusion of these systems can also be seen giving up territory – as well as chance to properly brand a key area part of the driving experience. And with touchscreens taking up more and more of car interiors, it’s even more ground ceded to a third-party It’s an issue some brands – such as Polestar have embraced – while others have been more reluctant. It’ll be interesting to see how the industry juggles brand experience and identity with the  inherent benefits of CarPlay and Android Auto. We’ll be updating this article with a list of car brands it’ll roll out to soon. Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
629,Renault's sustainability drive: why the new Scenic E-Tech gives a taste of the circular car of tomorrow,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/renault-sustainability-scenic-e-tech/,Tim Pollard,2023-12-22,Car Magazine UK,"A common criticism levelled at questions their true sustainability. They might have zero tailpipe emissions and whirr around in stately silence, but what about all the other stuff? The fossil-sourced energy when they plug in, the precious metals in the battery and carbon-intensive factories chomping through steel and plastic and goodness knows what else to build them in the first place… Wouldn’t we be better off never buying another car, servicing what we have and saving a fortune – and the planet – in the process? It’s a conundrum that’s driving the sustainability agenda across the automotive industry and Renault this autumn presented an answer: the new , its most sustainable electric family car yet. Twenty-seven years after the original first spawned the midi-MPV craze, the same nameplate has been slapped on an electric family SUV. What caught our eye at its world debut this autumn was the claims made for the circularity of its production. Nearly a quarter of its materials are recycled and 90% of its mass is recyclable at the end of life, meeting the strict standards enshrined in European directive 2005/64/EC. If the circular economy is becoming more relevant as we all consider our consumption habits, it seems Renault’s new family EV is especially keen to lighten its environmental impact. Crucially, that 90% recyclability figure includes the 87kWh nickel, manganese, cobalt (NMC) battery made by LG that’s nestled deep in the innards of the group’s latest CMF-EV platform. Renault has committed to be net zero in CO2 by 2040 in Europe, and worldwide by 2050. It’s an holistic approach that’s spawned the Refactory facility in Flins – the group’s skunkworks for driving down its carbon footprint, reimagining new ways of giving its vehicles a second life and dismantling end-of-life cars. ‘It’s truly cradle-to-grave,’ vows Gilles Le Borgne, Renault’s vice president of group engineering. The French car maker started using recycled materials in production back in 1993, so it’s hardly a new idea – but reused materials are fast becoming the norm, rather than the exception. An impressive 37% of metals on the Scenic are second-life while the bonnet and doors are 80% aluminium, reusing off-cuts from the production process. ‘We are looking at reusing second-fusion aluminium for safety parts like axles and so on, which is not the case today,’ adds Le Borgne. ‘The problem is the recycled parts can be too brittle, so we have to refine the alloy. It’s strange because the industry moved to high-grade, high-strength steel, but now we are going back to reusing conventional steel from H2 furnaces because it’s easier to recycle.’ This mantra of reduce, reuse, recycle has shaped the new Scenic E-Tech. An impressive 80% of the dashboard is made from second-life materials and the instrument cowls are 43% made of kenaf, a plant similar to jute. ‘Fabrics are one of the candidates to remove from our cars,’ the engineering chief reveals. ‘We have a lot of them.’ Hence why leather is banished from the new EV, the floor mats are made from recycled plastic bottles and the steering wheel is coated in bio-sourced ricin and cotton weft. The challenge is twofold: as well as using more sustainable materials in production at the Douai factory in France, the engineers are also charged with making the new Scenic easier to dismantle, or upgrade, at the end of life. Ninety percent of the new model can be recycled and the brainiacs at HQ are working out how to increase that figure to make future models wholly circular. Even the giant sunroof, dubbed the Solarbay panoramic glass roof (below), uses 50% automotive glass waste and nearly all of it can be recycled when it reaches the end of the road. ‘The last percentage points will be hard,’ admits Le Borgne. ‘The last 10% includes thermoset parts that are harder to recycle – they go to powder. All the glue, all the forming materials, it is very difficult. You have different areas where the process or technology does not yet exist to reuse them. Tyres are a problem, for instance: they are very difficult to reuse as is.’ So making that last 10 per cent recyclable will be hard miles, but Renault knows it has to do it. ‘Cost can be a problem, but recycling is like diversity. We know it’s the right thing to do and as a company we know we need to achieve it.’ Back at the dawn of the original Scenic its name stood for Safety Concept Embodied in a New Innovative Car. Perhaps today that should be updated to become Sustainable Construction Excellence in a New Intelligent Crossover.

630,Chinese EV giant BYD to build electric car factory in Hungary,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/byd/byd-european-car-factory-szeged-hungary/,Tim Pollard,2023-12-22,Car Magazine UK,"The world’s biggest manufacturer of has confirmed its first European car factory. today revealed plans for a brand-new manufacturing and production centre in Szeged in the south of Hungary. It’s the first time one of the new wave of Chinese EV manufacturers has made clear its intention to manufacture in the European Union (EU) and reflects how seriously China is challenging the established world order. No timeframe has been confirmed yet, but the Szeged plant will likely come on stream in the second half of the decade, just as Build Your Dreams ramps up its volume aspirations in the block. The facility will join an existing BYD bus factory in Hungary. BYD’s European CEO Michael Shu told earlier in 2023 that it wanted to be Europe’s biggest EV seller by 2030, accounting for one in 10 of the bloc’s electric car market. BYD says it will build the factory in phases. It ‘is expected to create thousands of local jobs, boost the local economy and support local supply chains. BYD will also utilise its expertise in integrated vertical supply chains to help create a green ecosystem locally.’ The company said it chose Hungary because of its position in the heart of Europe and on account of its long history of advanced manufacturing. Other brands based there include Audi and Mercedes-Benz. Hungary was chosen ahead of possible sites in Germany, France, Spain and Poland. Talks to buy Ford’s Saarlouis factory in Germany fell through. Build Your Dreams now has 230 retailers signed up across 19 European countries, selling five models. Three of them are available in the UK – the , and (below) – while other EU countries can also buy the Han and Tang. Three additional new BYD models are planned to arrive in 2024. It is not yet clear which models will be manufactured in the new Szeged facility. The news means that BYD has beaten its Chinese EV rival brands to establish a foothold in Europe. Nio, Great Wall and others are targeting the region, but none has announced firm plans for manufacturing here yet.

631,New Nio ET9 flagship revealed in China,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nio/et9/,Jake Groves,2023-12-27,Car Magazine UK,"Nio has revealed an all-new model at its 2023 Nio Day: the ET9. It’s only launching in China for now, but demonstrates some new technologies and acts as a luxury flagship for the electric car brand. The new ET9 is a four-seater with not-quite-saloon, not-quite-SUV crossover proportions. Nio says it’s designed to be a ‘smart electric executive flagship’, and it still features plenty of design elements of other Nio cars. Nio is calling the ET9’s interior the ‘executive bridge,’ almost as if you’re climbing into a luxury starship. Some features of note include rear seats with huge levels of adjustment (some of which are Nio patents) and a tray table that can rotate 360-degrees for those fortunate enough to sit in the back. Beyond the interior luxuries, though, is where it gets really interesting. The ET9 features steer-by-wire technology, rear-steer and fully active suspension, and Nio claims its flagship has ‘the world’s only driven-by-wire intelligent chassis’ and says that the ET9 is capable of delivering ‘a driving experience akin to travelling on a flat surface.’ The ET9 also runs a 900-volt electronic architecture – a novelty in the EV world. Such a high-voltage architecture (higher than that of cars like the Porsche Taycan and Hyundai Ioniq 5) means faster charging and lower weight, and it shows: Nio claims the ET9 has a peak charging power of 600kW. Nio says the ET9 also benefits from its swappable battery system like all of its other cars, where users can visit Power Swap Stations for a three-minute battery changeover. . It’s extremely unlikely that the ET9 will come to Europe, as the brand slowly enters markets on the Continent. In Nio’s home territory, it says buyers can order one now with the first examples arriving in 2025. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

632,Nio hits the 1000km range barrier,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/nio-1000km-battery/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-01-02,Car Magazine UK,"Nio has just squeezed over 1000km from one of its production-spec Ultra Long Range batteries. Completed back in December last year, the test involved a 14-hour drive from Shanghai to Xiamen, and was undertaken by none other than Nio’s CEO and founder, William Li. You can see how that ‘The completion of this range test marks the range of smart EVs going beyond 1000 kilometres, which will further promote the transformation of the automotive industry from the consumption of gasoline to electricity,’ said Li. The exact amount of distance covered was 1044km (649 miles) and included a stopover and driver swap with other legs also carried out by Dr. Fei Shen, the SVP of NIO Power, and Chenxia Huang, the general manager of Tencent News. After the 14-hour journey, the battery – installed in one of the company’s ET7 EVs – registered 3% of charge. Nio’s Ultra Long Range battery can be charged in a conventional manner, but the brand also pioneers an altogether different way of replenishing range. Nio has established a network of (2289 in China and 33 in Europe), in which customers can have depleted batteries, physically replaced for fully-charged ones.

633,New Everrati RSR swaps 3.8-litre flat-six for fully-electric,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_everrati/964-rsr/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-01-03,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at Everrati’s latest creation, a stunning homage to the Porsche 964 RSR. As you’d expect from Everrati, this 911 swaps out a 3.8-litre flat-six for an all-electric powertrain – but the car is actually based on a standard 964. Don’t worry, none of the original 51 964 RSRs were harmed in the making of this new EV. ‘Paying homage to a legendary model from three decades ago, our new “RSR” gets pulses racing with a host of lightweight enhancements, resulting in an unrivalled experience that combines the best of classic design with modern, zero-emission, performance,’ said Everrati founder and CEO Justin Lunny. ‘Like all our models, it features hand-built craftsmanship, with OEM-grade engineering processes, futureproofed via a state-of-the-art electric powertrain.’ Everrati used a narrow-bodied, stock 964 as a base, but it’s added extra bits of aero furniture to give it a more authentic RSR look. The front splitter is lower, while the rear spoiler larger and designed to ape the original racer. All the new bodywork has been hand-built in carbonfibre to keep things lightweight – good for detail, not so good for price. There are changes inside too; Everrati has ripped out the rear seats, added a roll cage, and swapped out the passenger and driver seats for more lightweight units. The whole thing runs on 18-inch alloys from HRE. Everrati has slipped in a 63kWh battery pack which includes second-generation tech. Improvements include improved cooling, and better efficiency over the previous iteration. No power figure has been given, but range should top a little over 200 miles, while a 0-60mph dash will take 3.7 seconds. Despite its EV powertrain, Everrati says weight distribution is ‘similar’ to the period car, while an active suspension system also aims to keep dynamics respectable. Like the other Everatti creations, the whole thing will be built by Aria Group in Irvine, California.

634,"New era, same success: Rolls-Royce sales the biggest ever",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/rolls-royce/2023-sales/,Colin Overland,2024-01-08,Car Magazine UK,"Rolls-Royce has had its most successful sales year ever. In 2023 it sold 6032 cars, up slightly on 2022’s record output of 6021. As before, the USA was the biggest market, followed by China. There was growth to record levels in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Euope. The biggest-selling model was the Cullinan SUV, followed by the Ghost, the smaller of Rolls-Royce’s two saloons. During 2023 production ended for the V12-powered Wraith coupe and Dawn convertible, and customers began to take delivery of the Spectre, which by the end of 2030 will form part of an electric-only line-up. Rolls-Royce always insists that big sales figures aren’t the aim. Increasingly, the emphasis is on customised models from the Bespoke division, which may not make huge numbers of cars but does add a healthy amount of profit, and pioneers the use of new techniques and different materials. New chief executive Chris Brownridge, who took on the role last autumn, said: ‘It’s especially encouraging to see the enormous interest in and demand for Spectre, supporting the decision to adopt a bold, all-electric strategy for future model development and production. The record level of Bespoke commissions, both by volume and value, also underlines our position within the luxury sector, offering our clients opportunities for self-expression and personalisation they cannot find anywhere else.’ To nurture relationships with high-spending individuals around the globe, Rolls is expanding its network of so-called Private Offices. The first was opened in Dubai in 2002, with Shanghai opening in 2023, and the US and South Korea set to follow in 2024. The idea is that customers who can’t easily get to Goodwood can visit their nearest Private Office to mull over the details of their Bespoke project in consultation with Rolls-Royce designers and engineers. Brownridge added: ‘As incoming CEO, I’m in the extremely fortunate position of taking over responsibility for a business in robust good health, with strong foundations and a clear strategy for growth and development, formidable technical capabilities and a focused, dedicated team. I’m looking forward to working with the entire Rolls-Royce team to maintain this momentum and take this great company forward with confidence and conviction.’ Research by the London School of Economics, commissioned by Rolls-Royce, calculates that the company has contributed more than £4 billion to the UK economy since the Goodwood site opened in 2003 under BMW ownership, and now injects around £500 million a year. From an initial workforce of around 300 people 20 years ago, building on average one Phantom per day, there are now more than 2500 staff at Goodwood. That includes 180 new posts created in 2023.

635,Afeela returns: Sony EV will benefit from Microsoft AI and Gran Turismo tech,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/sony-honda-2024-afeela-prototype/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-01-09,Car Magazine UK,"Sony has given us a fresh update on its forthcoming Afeela car, an EV developed in collaboration with Honda. Shown once again at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the new car was driven on stage remotely using one Sony’s DualSense PlayStation controllers – but theatrics aside, there were other key developments Design wise, the Afeela is relatively unchanged – with Sony saying it’s just been evolved to something closer to production spec. Still there are some new features; inside there’s now noise-cancelling and spatial audio tech and a new digital assistant powered by Microsoft Azure technology. SHM (Sony Honda Mobility) also revealed how the Afeela will use a combination of sensors and AI to realise autonomous driving – and employ Qualcomm high-performance chips to do it. An update on the collaboration with Epic Games was also shown, with a demo revealing how the Afeela will use the game engine, along with other inputs such as sensors and map data, to create a new experience for customers. As shown in the picture below, the Afeela can use Unreal Engine 5.3 along with other data points to create a virtual, highly detailed environment that comes with its own safety benefits. For example, in the image above, the driver is blinded but can still see the environment virtually in the cockpit screen. Alongside the new Afeela updates, SHM revealed it’ll now use Sony’s simulation technology when it comes to making real cars. Software, similar to the kind used in Polyphony’s series, will be used to develop areas around ‘human senses and emotions,’ in Afeela products.

636,BMW bets big on video and mixed reality at CES 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-tech-ces-2024/,Tim Pollard,2024-01-09,Car Magazine UK,"BMW picked the 2024 (CES) to showcase its next generation of in-car tech – with the emphasis on video services onboard, augmented and mixed reality, plus an updated voice control harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Rather than any one tech taking top honours, the Munich stand focused on a raft of digital technical features and services which will make incremental improvements to its product line-up in the months and years ahead. The ability to play multi-player video games was one eye-catching new feature – as well as the ability to watch live or streamed TV on catch-up, when the driver is parked up. The features will be part of the new ConnectedDrive App Store. The latest BMW operating system is OS9 which is compatible with BMW Digital Premium, allowing customers to download an ever-growing list of apps and services. New at CES was the integration of Bluetooth gaming controllers, which means passengers can play computer games when parked up, as demonstrated by a demo of Beach Buggy Racing 2. This feature will be launched later in 2024 and supplements the existing AirConsole app which lets owners use their smartphone as controllers to play numerous games onboard. OS8.5 and OS9 are now able to stream video services on the central display using the TiVo operating system, too (above). This was launched first in the new BMW 5-series an will join other models in the coming months. It is compatible with the UK. Also on show was the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant powered by Amazon’s Alexa AI service. It uses a large language model (LLM) to improve the voice commands given and received by users. From head-up displays to augmented reality, Munich has been playing with drive intel for decades. It showed new XReal Air 2 AR glasses at CES 2024, which allow users to see navigation instructions, hazard warnings and infotainment data streamed into their line of sight, wherever they look.

637,Facelifted Vauxhall Corsa now includes (mild) Hybrid models,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/vauxhall/corsa/,Jake Groves,2024-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"One of Britain’s best-selling cars has been given an overhaul with new electrified powertrains, updated styling and a revamped interior. The was one of Britain’s best-selling cars in 2023 and the facelift shows parent company Stellantis are prepared to double-down on affordable superminis while popular rival models – such as the – are taken off sale. The most obvious change is the introduction of Vauxhall’s Vizor front end. First seen on the , the dark panel sits between the LED headlights and houses the Corsa’s suite of driver assistance tech as well as showing off the updated Griffin logo. What’s more, IntelliLux LED Pixel Matrix headlights have been upgraded on the Corsa and are capable of automatically protecting oncoming drivers from the main beam without reducing visibility. Further updates include 17-inch alloy wheels with new black-effect detailing as well as a shark fin antenna towards the rear of the car. Finally, new ‘CORSA’ badging sits on the lower part of the tailgate. The central infotainment screen has been upgraded with a new user interface and gets a larger 10-inch display, while the 7-inch digital instrument cluster benefits from refreshed graphics. Also, Over-the-Air updates now feature, as does Connected 3D Navigation and Intelligent Voice Control. For those who’d rather use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto the Corsa is available with wireless compatibility for both, plus there’s the option of wireless smartphone charging for the first time. A new high-res panoramic rear-view camera helps with parking, while adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection are further safety features. Finally, a new steering wheel design, seat patterns and gear-lever also debut. The latest Corsa benefits from petrol engines that now have mild hybrid assistance, mostly designed to improve efficiency. The Corsa Hybrid models, as they’re named, benefit from a 99bhp or 134bhp three-cylinder engine and a 28bhp electric motor linked to a six-speed dual-clutch auto. Vauxhall claims only slight performance boosts over the non-MHEV engines also available (they’re just 0.1sec quicker to 62mph), and say te 99bhp and 134bhp engines are capable of up to 62.8mpg or 61.4mpg respectively. The Corsa Electric, meanwhile, has also seen some revisions. In addition to the existing 136hp spec, the Corsa Electric now comes with a punchier 156hp unit with a 51kWh battery and 255-mile range – a 15% increase on the base offering. An 11kW on-board charger comes as standard and allows a 0-100% charge in 5hrs 15mins, while 100kW rapid charging sees a typical 10-80% charge in around 30 minutes. For those using a 7kW home wallbox, the full charge is estimated to take 7hrs and 30 mins. Vauxhall is yet to confirm prices for the new Corsa and Corsa Electric, although as is normally the case a slight increase on the £19k and £34k respective starting prices is expected.

673,Refreshed 2024 Skoda Octavia is all about the interior,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/octavia/,Jake Groves,2024-02-14,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda has announced updates for its popular Octavia hatchback and estate. The updated model will go on sale later in 2024 and benefits from some light tweaks inside and out. In terms of exterior design, the only noticeable difference is the new lighting structure on the 2024 Skoda Octavia, with more aggressive day-running lights (DRLs) that can be had with new-generation matrix LED lights on higher-spec models. The biggest change is arguably the interior design and technology, with a revised look to the dashboard and a reorganisation of some of the storage areas. The Octavia’s infotainment screen is larger and now features new-generation software. Skoda says that, like VW, it will also include ChatGPT into its voice assistant, making it smarter and able to conduct more tasks for drivers. Specs available on the new Skoda Octavia hatch and estate don’t deviate from what we’ve become used to: SE Technology, SE L, SportLine and the sporty vRS. Well-specced SE L also features a range of ‘design selections’ with upholstery combos similar to those seen on the Enyaq, including Loft, Lodge, Lounge, Suite Black and Suite Cognac. The Octavia’s engine range has been lightly tweaked, too, with a 114bhp petrol and diesel, 148bhp petrol and diesel engines and a punchier 262bhp 2.0-litre engine for the vRS performance hero (below). Skoda has confirmed a mid-pegging 201bhp petrol will arrive in 2025, and the range will likely include iV plug-in hybrid models soon, too. The conventional 114bhp and 148bhp engines are available with both a six-speed manual or a seven-speed auto (which includes mild hybrid assistance), while the vRS is auto only. The diesel vRS model no longer exists. We will update this Skoda Octavia news story once we know the full specs, prices and further details on the PHEV models in due course.

674,Nissan’s Juke gets a cockpit-focused refresh,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/nissan/juke/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-14,Car Magazine UK,"Nissan has given its Juke crossover a refresh, mostly focusing on the baby SUV’s interior. No, really – this is the ‘new’ Juke for 2024 and beyond. So much so that the biggest fanfare of the car’s updated exterior design is the fact it’s available in yellow again, like the previous generation. New wheel designs and a fresh tyre compound for the Juke Hybrid model feature, and a new N-Sport model grade throws some more styling at the car. Aaaaand that’s about it. But inside is where it’s at, and where Nissan has focused a lot of its attention. The pre-facelift car’s interior looked interesting until you started to poke and prod – then you noticed the old-generation infotainment, fiddly user interface and some very cheap-feeling materials. We should know – we didn’t really get on with our Juke long-term test car back in 2019 all that well. This new Juke, however, aims to up the game with a redesigned cockpit. New seats that promise to be more comfortable, as well as fresh material choices for each of the car’s trim levels are included. The most noticeable bit, though, is the new 12.3-inch infotainment screen that’s angled towards the driver. You can customise the main screen, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included. Fully-digital instruments are included from N-Connecta trim and above, too. Nissan is also keen to point out that the Juke has a quick-access custom mode for all of its safety tech, minimising the amount of button presses needed. As for engines, the range remains unchanged. The entry-level is a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine that develops 112bhp and is available with a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch auto. Then there’s the Juke Hybrid model, which develops 141bhp and is capable of around 58mpg. Prices start at £23,485 for the entry-level Acenta Premium.

638,MBUX Sound Drive will turn your Mercedes into an interactive concert,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mbux-sound-drive/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-01-10,Car Magazine UK,"Creative soothsayer and music artist will.i.am has once against teamed up with Mercedes to offer up MBUX Sound Drive; an unusual piece of tech that provides a unique soundtrack for every journey. As you’d expect, it was shown at CES earlier this week. ‘At Mercedes-Benz, we want digital innovation to bring a smile to our customers’ faces through exciting new features that make a real difference to every journey,’ said Markus Schäfer, Mercedes CTO. ‘With MBUX Sound Drive, AMG drivers are in control of the way their music sounds. It makes in-car entertainment much more immersive.’ Every trip is different, and Sound Drive ensures you have the music to match. Simply put, Sound Drive takes every input and event in the car – whether it’s acceleration, steering angle, braking or even energy recuperation – and combines it all into music. Steer more, accelerate more or brake more, for example, and you’ll find different elements of the music react to your inputs. By reacting to how the car is being driven, Mercedes claims there can be a ‘harmonious between motion and melody.’ The system only works with specially adapted tracks for now, presumably with each channel mapped to a different parameter of the car. For example, braking could change the volume of the drums, steering could change the strength of the vocals and so on. ‘I’m excited to see how composers, producers, and songwriters will harness this to create new works and reimagine classics for motorist to drive to,’ said will.i.am. ‘MBUX Sound Drive is not only a new frontier for music creation, but also opens up fresh, exciting and interactive listening experiences for drivers.’ Just a handful of tracks are available at the time of writing, but Mercedes hopes more will soon follow will.i.am’s lead. Yes, this isn’t just a tech demo for CES. Mercedes says Sound Drive will be available on Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Benz cars with the second-gen MBUX version from mid-2024. Customers with earlier models may be able to upgrade using an OTA (over-the-air) upgrade if it’s available in their region.

The latter was launched with many a soundbite courtesy of US musician and producer will.i.am, but we chose to sit down with Mercedes’ chief technical officer Markus Schäfer to hear a bit more about various challenges and plans the brand is facing. : ‘I think we are on a trajectory where you see even more screens in the car to some extent. You will see more seamless screens. So what we call the pillar-to-pillar seamless screen that we showed in . ‘One day, where we have really something that goes from left and right, to a pillar. Something that is a really, really stunning experience. ‘What is nice about screens is if you’re talking immersive experience in the car. Your senses should be activated by watching something. By combining this visual experience with the audio you create this immersive experience. I think the screen is a very, very essential part at least for the next couple of years. If you look at the projections, and if you’ve come to CES for some time, you’ll see window projections. Cool, I will take that if they were useful outside of a car show or an exhibition, but they have so many downsides at the moment. Maybe for the rear-window glass, but to have projections at the front there are so many downsides. That’s why our way is working with high-quality screens.’ ‘There were some very optimistic forecasts a while ago. It reminds me a little bit of the forecasting of autonomous drive and all this optimism. ‘For me, it’s a head-to-head race. Unexpectedly the conventional lithium ions have got so much better energy density. Both technologies can do it, so what is really the benefit of a solid-state battery? ‘So many people are working on the conventional batteries and so we’re making them so much better that it’s a head to head race and I don’t know who the winner is going to be. ‘So you might get the first batteries in 2025/26 but I don’t think that they come with a major cost advantage or warm energy advantage. On the safety side of course they come with this advantage. In terms of cost, that is the starting point, there are some slight improvements but nt the major improvement.’ We will see a new combustion engine in MMA. It was developed for battery first and we will also made it available for mild hybrid. It is a highly efficient engine with a very attractive cost basis. It is Euro 7, mild hybrid and connected to a brand new transmission. No, the car will be developed by the AMG-G group. It is electric only. The vehicles are moving a notch up in terms of size. We will offer the customer more than what they get from the current CLA, EQA. We are moving up a bit in the segment – we are not going to the next segment, the customer will get more. into the brand. There will be four cars. A CLA, CLA Shooting Brake – not a station wagon – and two SUVs. We are not a volume producer, with the complexity of seven vehicles, you can imagine how small the individual amount of sales is for each of these vehicles. These cars are not worldwide vehicles. I know they are popular – there are many fans of the A-Class, but it is not a car that China takes as the biggest market in the world. It is very difficult to build a business case. Every segment or model is moving up a notch and that is happening throughout the portfolio. ‘It is by far not over. But maybe some realities for some different competitors, who see that it’s not an easy problem to solve. Definitely too optimistic at the beginning. There’s a lot of variable cost to take a car to level three. We need the sensors in the car, the laser scanner, the LIDAR you need the cameras you need you need the radar system in the car. ‘That’s why so many companies are focusing on level two level two plus two plus plus. Our philosophy is we should have a distinction between level two and level three. Level three the car takes over, level two the driver’s in charge and you should never mix this up. ‘In this world, hypes are coming and going, but it’s not the case that AI was not available a year ago. It got more intense after chat GPT and there is more focus now. ‘Last year we had Chat GPT in all our cars in the US, so after CES we decided to offer all our customers a beta version of Chat GPT. We have it already, we didn’t make a big fuss about it, we were getting experience with it.’ ‘We’re taking all the learnings that we have over the last nine months with Chat GPT in the car and what we have announced today is the next development of that. Tom Webster is our Vans Editor, as well as being the Deputy Head of the Bauer Digital Automotive Hub, meaning he has a keen focus on all things vans and automotive ownership."
640,Mazda 2 Hybrid facelifted; Europe remains indifferent,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mazda/2-hybrid/,Jake Groves,2024-01-11,Car Magazine UK,"Mazda has given a cosmetic nip and tuck to its 2 Hybrid supermini, adding in some new tech and a more differentiated look compared to its Toyota Yaris twin. The Mazda family face has been grafted onto the front with the car’s updated grille and bumper shapings and new rear lights feature as standard. New interior tech includes the base model benefitting from a full colour screen as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Exclusive-Line features more safety and parking assistance, while the top-spec Homura and Homura Plus grades throw in luxuries like digital instruments and navigation. Otherwise, the Mazda 2 Hybrid remains the same underneath. The powertrain is the same as the Yaris Hybrid, meaning a 114bhp hybrid system connected to a CVT transmission. This isn’t a bad thing, mind – the powertrain is smooth and pretty efficient, and Mazda says the 2 Hybrid claims up to 74.3mpg and emissions as low as 87g/km depending on spec. The Mazda 2 Hybrid is on sale now, with prices starting from £24,130 for a base-spec Centre-Line model. And, if you’re looking for a regular combustion-powered Mazda 2, the brand still sells that alongside. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

641,VW’s new Tiguan starts from £34k in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/tiguan/,Jake Groves,2024-01-11,Car Magazine UK,"Did you know the VW Tiguan outsells the Golf these days? It’s a massive seller, so a crucial car to get right. The brand is pretty keen to do just that, ensuring it’s fixed some of the brand’s infotainment quirks and improved the platform that sits beneath its latest Tiguan. The latest generation has arrived and UK sales have opened, with prices starting from £34k. Want the full skinny on what you get for your wedge? Get reading… It’s certainly a familiar shape, at least. The biggest difference is definitely at the front end, with shallow headlights (now available with IQ.Light matrix LED lenses) and a lower grille arrangement, which sort of looks like a basking shark trying its hardest to smile. The design is clearly meant to show a family resemblance between and the latest-generation Passat. As well as a base-spec, there’s also a Life trim, mid-level Elegance (pictured in green) and sporty R-Line (pictured in orange). The latest Tiguan copies much of ’s homework here. So, yes, that means a larger screen, a cleaner design and a steering column-mounted gear shifter – and a stubborn lack of physical switchgear that some (including many of us) are crying out for the return of. But the design itself looks tidy, with VW’s usual material quality remaining. Neat details include an all-new AI-assisted voice assistant named IDA, and high-up trims will be available with a twin wireless charger in the centre console. The new infotainment is named MIB4, and is expected to be rolled out across more VW models in the years to come after its debut on . As we’ve said before with the ID.7 and Passat, the system has had a major rethink over the older MIB3 system used in the current Golf and in that it rows back some of the several-menus-deep settings and fixes some ergonomic irritations like non-backlit controls. There are some customisable quick-access areas that allow, er… quick access to certain functions or settings. The climate controls are also permanently affixed to the bottom row. Something that’s all new for the Tiguan, though, is the new ‘driving experience switch.’ As well as incorporating a physical volume control (hurrah), the dial can also change your drive mode or… *cue eye roll*… while you’re in the car. ‘With 4Motion models that come with off-road and snow modes, you can activate that here,’ says Tiguan product expert, Dominic Stern, ‘but if you press the dial and swipe on its little screen you can change the car’s atmosphere. This is basically a pre-set for the ambient lighting, and it’s connected with the sound system.’ The Energetic atmosphere, for example, spices the cockpit up with red lighting and turns the music up. The latest Tiguan uses the MQBevo platform from VW Group, which is being nicknamed ‘MQB perfect’ in-house. It’s basically VW’s same modular architecture as before that’s been given some technical upgrades to see it through to the end of the decade. A mix of petrols, diesels and plug-in hybrids are available and all use a dual-clutch auto. VW says that, for the German market at least, 95 per cent of journeys are less than 31 miles (50km) long, and 99 per cent are shorter than 62 miles (100km). So it’s not a coincidence, then, that the eHybrid PHEV models are capable of around 62 miles of e-range before it needs to charge again. See below for the UK’s engine options: Clear as mud, right? What’s not been officially confirmed yet is model, but it’s not a stretch to consider one part of the product plan. The platform is just an upgrade, and VW’s boss Thomas Schäfer has confirmed that combustion engine R models will continue until . That and the fact that VW has already sold 10,000 of them. Still a pretty spacious family bus. The new Tiguan is a smidge taller and longer by 30mm, but the wheelbase hasn’t changed. That translates to no increase in rear legroom (which was actually pretty decent anyway), but 10mm more headroom and a 37-litre increase in boot space with the rear seats up (to 652 litres). As well as loads of storage spaces and pockets in the seat backs for those in the second row, VW has introduced a new mechanism in the armrest that pops out to reveal two cupholder spaces and a slot to rest your phone. The panel can be angled towards either of the rear occupants. Sort of. Stern tells us the (also nicknamed the ‘ ’ in the CAR office, thanks to fellow colleague ) will not make it to this new generation, but something will replace it. ‘There must be an SUV to close the gap between Tiguan and the Touareg in Europe,’ says Stern, ‘and there will be a second SUV which will replace the Allspace. It will have seven seats and a plug-in hybrid option if you want, but it’s not a Tiguan.’ That new model is the Tayron. It’s an SUV that’s currently on sale in China built by the FAW-Volkswagen joint venture, and has been rumoured to be making it to Europe for years. The Tayron is likely to be updated in the near future and, according to reports, is expected to also be built in Europe. It’s a seven-seater, and includes a coupe version called Tayron X. VW’s latest-generation Tiguan is on sale now in the UK. Prices start from £34,060 for the Tiguan’s likely-spartan base spec, rise to £35,905 for a Life model, £39,275 for Elegance and £39,680 for R-Line.

Revealed at the 2024 Toyko Auto Salon, it’s a concept model equipped with the brand’s forthcoming range of performance parts – and it looks like an unholy mixture of electric SUV and touring car. The parts will be available for purchase later this year,  and you can expect them to be just as outrageous as those on the Ioniq 5 N you see here. Hyundai has been making performance parts since 2019, but are the first designed specifically for an EV. Have a quick look at the picture above and you’ll get a sneak peak of the new N Performance catalogue: on the outside, there’s a carbon front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser, rear wing spoiler and lightweight hybrid carbon wheels. That’s a lot of carbon, but the Ioniq 5 N doesn’t really need much extra weight. What you can’t see are high-performance brake pads and lowering springs, as well as an interior with added Alcantara and racing bucket seats. The kit you see here is, but Hyundai has plans to develop performance-enhancing products too.  Joon Park, vice president of N brand management group said: ‘Not limited to tuning parts, we are also developing software customization such as sound and vehicle calibration by OTA updates which will open a completely new category of EV customization for an exciting future ahead for the tuning community.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

Well, you get this; the rather ridiculous LBX Morizo RR Concept. The brainchild of Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota (who goes by the name Morizo when he’s driving) it was revealed at the Tokyo Auto Salon with specs as silly as you’d hope. The Morizo RR uses a turbocharged in-line three cylinder engine that delivers 300bhp @6500 revs (that’s around 20bhp more than the new Yaris) – to all four wheels via an eight-speed automatic ‘box. The rest of the car has been upgraded to deal with the new performance too, so the LBX’s body, suspension and tyres have all been overhauled. Aero has been improved too, with engineers drawing inspiration and technology from the world of high-speed air racing. In addition to the performance bump, Toyota and Lexus engineers have also added some small visual differences to the car’s exterior.

646,Ford Kuga SUV facelifted with new Active spec,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/kuga/,Jake Groves,2024-01-17,Car Magazine UK,"Ford has unveiled its redesigned Kuga SUV for 2024. Alongside giving it a based facelift, the powertrain range has been revised and there’s a new trim. That fresh look puts it in line with the Ford Escape crossover sold across the Atlantic, with a cleaner and slightly more muscular look as well as a light bar running across the centre of the grille. The Active trim – which has been available on Fords for a good while, including the new Tourneo Courier – also becomes available with this updated Kuga, with chunkier styling and bespoke details alongside entry Titanium and sporty ST-Line specs. For the UK, the Kuga is available with a 1.5-litre EcoBoost petrol making 148bhp, as well as two hybrid models with either 178bhp (front-wheel drive) or 180bhp (all-wheel drive). There’s also a PHEV option developing 240bhp. New tech includes a refresh of the brand’s SYNC4 system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, new trailer assist software and ‘dynamic pixel’ headlights that can change the beam to react to corners and signs. Orders are open now with the first deliveries coming towards the end of January 2024. Prices start at £32,080 in the UK.

647,Korma Kona: Hyundai releases mildly spicy Kona Electric N Line,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/kona-suv/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-01-17,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has revealed a new N Line version of its electric Kona crossover. Significantly, Hyundai’s best-selling EV (that’s over the and Ioniq 6) is the first to get the mildly spicy N Line treatment. Here’s what you need to know about Hyundai’s latest sport-centric move. The Kona Electric N Line looks just as futuristic as the stock car, but now adds a dash of aggression to the mix. Bumpers on the front and rear have been tidied up with bolder features, and they’re joined by a pair of stylish new side skirts. The whole thing rolls on N Line-only 19-inch wheels, and the sportier Kona Electric is adorned with exclusive N Line badging. Inside, the mildly spicy Kona also gets sports seats with red contrasting stitching, and other red details on the dashboard and wheel. UK customers will be able to choose from an N Line or N Line S trim, with prices starting at £40,395 for the N Line 65kWh. The N Line S begins at £43,095 but adds extra mod cons such as Alcantara and leather trimmed seats and a Bose premium sound system inside. The N Line S also gets LED DRL’s as standard. Although the N Line is featured on the Electric first, it’ll be available on all powertrains, including ICE and hybrid. Production is due to begin next month, with deliveries starting in spring. Read everything else about the standard car below. This is the all-new Hyundai Kona. It’s the second-generation version of the company’s popular family SUV, which is due to hit the UK market in August 2023. It’ll compete against a broad range of rivals, including the , , and . On the surface, the new Kona looks like an evolution of the previous model, but Hyundai assures us it’s a stark departure. It’ll be offered with a choice of hybrid and electric powertrains but, unlike the old car, the firm’s engineers designed the EV model first then made the hybrid variants fit its profile. This change is due to Hyundai’s expected sales split during the Kona’s life cycle. Currently, EVs account for around 40% of the brand’s sales, but Hyundai Europe’s president and CEO, Michael Cole, told us that figure will soon swell past 50%. So, it’s important Hyundai has a strong electric vehicle in the volume-driven B-segment to complement the larger and the . We’ve spent some time in the studio with the car – here’s what we learned. The pricing structure for the EV-variant of the Kona will be as follows. Cars are getting bigger – and the new Kona is no exception. It measures 4355mm long and 1825mm wide, making it 150mm longer and 25mm wider than the previous model. However, Hyundai assures us this isn’t just size for the sake of size. The company has tried to make the new car more practical than the old one. So, its wheelbase has increased by 60mm and the front seat backs are 30% slimmer than the previous car’s, which has liberated a little more legroom for those in the rear. The boot opening is also wider and lower, while boot capacity has shot up from 374 litres to 466 litres. The Kona’s styling is equally functional. Ssangyup Lee, Hyundai’s global head of design, explained how the car’s front end was designed to produce the best results in wind tunnel testing. That’s particularly important for the electric variants, because the more aerodynamic an EV is, the more miles it can eke out of its battery pack. Ssangyup’s efforts produced a car with a drag co-efficient of 0.27. That means this tall-riding SUV is as aerodynamic as a . That’s impressive, but it took a lot of clever engineering to arrive at that figure. The front bumper, for example, was designed to wrap around the front of the car like a rocket’s nose cone. The panel joints are pushed back along the wings, meaning they don’t take the full force of the air rushing over the front of the car, which create less turbulence. There’s also an active shutter in the front grille that blocks the opening when it isn’t required for cooling. Hyundai has moved the Kona’s interior design on, too. Sangyup said: ‘The whole theme about this interior is the furniture design. Car interiors are becoming more of a living space than a driving space. So why can’t the interior be more like functional furniture?’ There are loads of clever features designed to make the cabin practical and functional. For example, the centre was made large enough to swallow a handbag and there’s a household plug socket in the rear, so you can charge your laptop while you work on the go. Lee has also tried to buck the current trends of automotive design in the name of practicality. He used the line between the Kona’s dashboard and the door card as an example. ‘A lot of cars have a horizontal line trying to connect with the door and the pillar all the way around. But that’s never going to work because the door panel is mounted on the door and the instrument panel is mounted on the firewall – and it’s impossible to make that line match perfectly. Instead, we totally separate them like your own house. The door is a door, the wall is a wall and the window is a window, instead of tying everything together. ‘To make that line match up, we always pull the instrument panel backwards [into the cabin]. For the Kona, we are pushing the instrument panel forwards. So, you don’t have a lot of dents sticking out, which also [makes it easier] to get in and out of the car.’ The new Kona’s infotainment system is a whopper. The most expensive models feature a pair of 12.3-inch screens, complete with Hyundai’s Connected Car Navigation Cockpit and over-the-air updates. Eventually (and Cole stresses that this isn’t happening on the Kona yet) this tech could allow Hyundai to launch a subscription-based service for items like its heated seats and wheel. Hyundai built the Kona on the same K3 platform found under the latest Kia Niro. As such, you’d expect the two cars would share their electric powertrains – but you’d be wrong. The flagship Kona has a more powerful 214bhp electric motor and a bigger 65.4kWh battery than the equivalent Niro. Hyundai hasn’t yet pushed the Kona through WLTP homologation, but it reckons its extra 0.6kWh of battery capacity and its clever aero package are enough to bump up its maximum range to 304 miles. That’s 19 miles more than the Kia. There will also be a less powerful (and cheaper) version of the Kona Electric with a 48.4kWh battery, a 154bhp electric motor and a range of 212 miles. It seems a little odd considering Kia didn’t bother with the new Niro, but European CEO Michael Cole seems confident in the decision. He said: ‘I think the current model Kona small battery is about 10% of sales. So, I think the small battery still has a market – and you’re looking at, you know, obviously giving that entry point.’ Despite the Kona’s electric-first approach, Cole also told us that Hyundai won’t ditch combustion power completely. As before, it’ll be offered with a range of mild and full hybrid powertrains, all based on the Hyundai Group’s 1.6-litre ‘Smartstream’ petrol engine. ‘Hybrid is also growing,’ Cole explained. ‘Pure internal combustion engines are gradually diminishing, but I still think that, for the European situation, hybrid will probably still be around 25, maybe even 30% [of Kona sales].’ Interestingly, Cole also told us that plug-in hybrid power ‘was never a consideration’ for the Kona, despite the fact Kia offers the technology on the latest Niro. ‘It wasn’t part of our plan,’ he said. ‘We always had it as being internal combustion, hybrid and EV. We didn’t see the plug-in as being so important in that segment. ‘What’s also happening – and it varies by market – is what we’re seeing now in Germany. The government support they had there for plug-in, there is no support anymore. Still, benefit-in-kind of course, because you’ve got low CO2, there’s still some advantage, but the plug-in hybrid sales are slowing down.’ We only spent a few hours with the car, but we can already tell it’s more practical than the old model. Its boot can now compete with the best-in-class and there’s way more space in the rear, especially in the electric models as they have a completely flat floor. If we had to make a complaint about the cabin, it’s that the C-pillar slopes down quite sharply. It looks great from the outside and it makes the rear of the car feel very snug, but you need to be careful not to headbutt it when exiting the car because it’s right next to your temple. Material quality has taken a very noticeable step up. The infotainment system is vastly improved over the previous car and the stuff you regularly interact with (like the steering wheel, switchgear and door handles) all feel solid. Go digging under the dashboard and you’ll find where Hyundai has cut corners, though. The release handle for the bonnet feels a little flimsy, for example – and you’ll be using it much more often than you did in the old car because that’s where the EV’s charging cables are stored now. We’re looking forward to getting the Kona on UK roads. We’re particularly curious to find out whether the electric model really can deliver the range boost Hyundai claims over the Kia Niro EV.

648,We drive a BMW from several hundred metres away,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-remote-parking/,Tom Webster,2024-01-23,Car Magazine UK,"Remember that BMW 7 Series in Tomorrow Never Dies? The one that Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond drove remotely using a – for the time – high-tech mobile phone? Reality didn’t catch up as fast as it has for some other futuristic movie innovations (we gawped at huge-screen video calling once) but we have finally had the chance to drive a while being nowhere near the driver’s seat. Before you get your hopes up, though, our experience was somewhat more pedestrian than Bond’s high-speed chase through a multi-storey car park. Our drive did, however, also take place in a parking lot, but we were outside CES in Las Vegas and, instead of crouching down in the rear seats while evading gunfire, we were in what looked a lot like a high-end gaming rig with several large screens in front of us. We were trying out a system that is very much in concept phase at the moment, which is hoped to help in situations such as valet parking. The autonomous car of the future might well be able to park itself in a standard spot in a conventionally shaped lot, but any driver knows that this is not how most car parks work. If your event parking is in a field nearby the exclusive country house your evening ball is taking place in, your car isn’t going to be able to rely on reading the signs and road markings for example. This system, therefore, is designed to provide backup when there are oddities that need to be navigated. It’s been jointly developed with Valeo, the automotive tech company that specialises in areas such as electrification, on-board tech, lighting and, of course, assistance systems. This isn’t the first time we’ve tried out one of BMW’s futuristic systems – we had a go at for example. The car in question here was an electric iX SUV, although it was hard to make out given the camouflage wrap it was sporting. And the fact that it was the other side of a relatively large parking lot outside the CES show halls in Vegas. We were sitting in something that bore no resemblance to the interior of a BMW, though. Instead it felt more like a high-end gaming rig that belonged on a non-automotive stand somewhere inside the tech show. All that was missing was the four-point harness on the figure-hugging bucket-style race seat. To go with this was a small racing wheel, two pedals and five large displays – three in place of the windscreen and two either side of the wheel. Given the 6mpg (10km/h) top speed of the car out in the lot, this felt a little bit much. It could just be that the tech geeks behind the development couldn’t resist going overboard on the hardware though. Despite that severely limited top speed, the sensation of driving felt a lot more urgent. Whether it was the digital display or just the fact that we felt like we were sitting in something more set up to hurtle around a virtual Nürburgring, we routinely felt like we were travelling faster than the readout said. This meant we felt minded to ease off, probably to BMW’s relief, more often than not. The odd sensation was compounded when we glanced up to look at the real car travelling at no more than a crawling pace around the car park. The chances of crashing were made even more remote by the many systems on board the BMW that leapt in to keep you from even getting close to the road furniture. It’s so cautious that you won’t get anywhere close to a nearby bush or bollard before it brings everything to a halt. It will also bring everything to a standstill if it loses the wireless connection, which happened a couple of times. Granted, you might have a little more control over the wireless network in an isolated car park than you do sitting just outside CES in Vegas. BMW and Valeo have tweaked the driving sensation, so it feels, frankly, nothing like piloting an iX. It uses a one-pedal system, so you only have to lift your foot off the accelerator and it will, once again, come to a complete stop. As all this suggests, there is little chance of your valet parking attendant going berserk with your car when you drop the keys off with them – even if they try their hardest, they are unlikely to come to any grief. If something bad did happen, then it could well be that they are nowhere near to suffer the consequences or sort the problem out. This is designed so that the driver could be anywhere, even in a totally different location tucked away in a little booth, playing parking attendant. This isn’t going to happen any time soon, though, as we are at least three years away from this becoming something that could make it into a production car. Whether it becomes more or less cautious in that time remains to be seen, but it is unlikely to get faster and more reckless. Should the BMW remote parking system make it to the US market, expect someone to come up with an adjoining system that allows you to tip your parker. Even if they are several states away, they won’t want to miss out on that part of the process.

649,Facelifted VW Golf 8.5 promises to be less annoying this time,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/golf/,Jake Groves,2024-01-23,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has pulled the covers off its refreshed and Estate, as well as the GTI and GTE models. The 8.5 facelift might look extremely similar to the previous car, but the aim has mainly been to address some of the Golf 8’s biggest flaws – mainly surrounding infotainment, software and interior quality. The brand and its engineers, software developers and product managers have been hard at work updating and upgrading the bits that matter and, crucially, the bits that really did need fixing after the Mk8 redesign backfired – something that Michael Blaul, VW’s product marketing manager for the Golf, told us was a ‘painful experience’ with the initial launch of the Mk8 Golf. ‘It was a radical strategy to change everything [with the Mk8],’ says Blaul. ‘Because the average Golf customer had a Mk7, and before it a Mk6 and so on – they expect to step into the car and everything is there where you expect it, and that nobody has to explain it. [The Mk8] was the first time we had to explain everything.’ VW is hoping to turn its fortunes and the car’s reputation back around with the Golf 8.5 as the nameplate celebrates its 50 anniversary in 2024. Visually, not much has. The Golf 8.5 features a revised front light signature with more angular backlit headlight surrounds, as well as a glowing front badge – a first for Volkswagen, as restrictions on lighting use regarding logos are relaxed. Redesigned bumpers, including a squarer lower valance for R-line and GTI models, and some refreshed wheels (including fat five-spoke aero ones also seen on the new Passat, and almost Alfa Romeo-like ones for the GTI) feature. New lights at the rear feature, too. Inside, not a great deal has changed either. Proper physical switchgear for the steering wheel makes a return, and the new infotainment system is on a MASSIVE screen. The screen itself is 10.4 inches as standard, with a larger 12.9-inch version offered on higher trims or as an option. Besides the physical screen size, the infotainment has seen the biggest overhaul with the introduction of MIB4 also seen on the latest and , as well as Skoda-flavoured version on the and . The old MIB3 one was mired with lag, bugs and even some frankly silly UI oversight. The touch slider for the volume and temperature controls wasn’t backlit, for example, making it useless at night, while the system itself was deeply laggy in its infancy (it was fixed somewhat with later updates) and riddled with menus and sub-menus for basic functions. While the new MIB4 software here is still entirely reliant on touchscreens and touch panels, there’s a permanent quick-access climate control overlay and the ability to add a layer of icons on the top row for the settings you use the most. Our early test showed it felt much more responsive, too – though a bigger CAR ‘Does It Work?’ test will happen soon. Much more on-trend news came at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show, which saw Volkswagen announced that its new IDA personal assistant would be augmented with generative AI. This isn’t the first time that the AI chatbot service has been available in a car; DS has incorporated ChatGPT into its Iris infotainment in a trial phase, and – but VW says it’s the first brand that will have the software integrated as standard. It reflects the creeping ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) and how it’s popping up in all walks of life. UK variants are to be confirmed, but VW has announced Life, Style and R-line trims for the Golf hatch and estate as well as a refresh of the GTI and GTE. For the standard Golf hatchback and estate, there is a range of engines available. There are two TSI petrols (113bhp and 148bhp), two mild hybrid eTSI petrols (113bhp and 148bhp), two diesels (113bhp and 148bhp) and an eHybrid version generating 201bhp. The model features a 19.7kWh battery pack and e-motor as well as a 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine, and claims around 62 miles of electric-only range is possible. Then there’s the . It, too, claims up to 62-miles of e-range, but benefits from 268bhp. Both the eHybrid and GTE PHEVs can be charged at up to 11kW on AC chargers and now up to 50kW via DC fast chargers. GTI fans will be pleased as the potent 2.0-litre turbo engine has seen a power boost to 261bhp, but only a seven-speed DSG auto is listed in the engine specifications, marking the end of a manual Golf GTI. After more punch? A facelifted and refreshed will be on the way later in 2024. VW says the first deliveries will start in the spring of 2024. UK prices and specs are to be confirmed, but likely won’t change too much from their current offerings. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

650,Volkswagen’s new Passat hits the road from £38k,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/passat/,Jake Groves,2024-01-25,Car Magazine UK,"UK pricing for the new Volkswagen Passat have finally been revealed. What’s billed by its maker as ‘the most aerodynamic VW estate yet’ is now on sale and kicks off from £38,400, with deliveries set for later this spring. Keep reading to find out what the full UK model range looks like. This Passat is only available as an estate for this generation in all markets (it’s called the Passat Variant on the Continent), and it’s all about maximising space and efficiency. In reality, it feels like VW’s last stand on two fronts – the traditional large family estate car, and a piston-engined one at that. Of course, the Passat has always been a big and roomy car. But for this new generation, running on VW’s new MQBevo platform, the Passat reaches new heights. And lengths. And volumes. What VW doesn’t tell you is that Skoda actually took the lead with the development of this generation of Passat, not VW. The Czech brand was handed the keys to the Passat’s future to simplify development costs with . So many of the things you’ll see here today will also feature on the Superb which will, interestingly, benefit from hatchback version as well as a wagon. The new Passat is also one of the first cars with VW’s new MIB4 infotainment system after the all-electric ID.7. Keen to brush its clunky, bug-ridden and menu-tastic MIB3 software that debuted on the Mk8 Golf and ID.3 under the rug, Volkswagen has worked hard to answer our calls for simplicity, as well as customers who bought cars with the older software. Yes, the keen-eyed among you will have noticed that as early as we did during an exclusive preview, despite VW chanting all sorts of buzzwords surrounding the term ‘usability’ at us. The new Passat’s interior is immensely clean and tidy, with a super simple interface that’s designed to maximise the amount of general tat you can fit in it. But, yes, there aren’t a lot of buttons at all on that dashboard. Almost all controls are connected to the large central touchscreen (which is 12.9-inches as standard, with a 15-inch option) or controlled by the physical buttons on the steering wheel (as VW removes those awful haptic panels from service as new models come out). Before you grumble too much, however, we can say that during our early preview of the new Passat, the system responded quickly and smoothly, and many of the settings have been made easier to access. Climate control options, for example, are permanently affixed along the bottom row of the screen now, and you can customise the top row to include settings you change regularly (including things like start/stop). The shifter has been moved to the steering column, for example, in order to create a huge cubby area in the centre console that includes cupholders, charging ports and wireless charging pads as well as a deeper storage bin under the armrests. Quality, meanwhile, is impressive in that solid VW kind of way – and there’s a slightly artsy dashboard panel backlit by ambient light. Oh, absolutely. That MQBevo platform has meant a 50mm increase in the Passat’s wheelbase, which VW has pretty much exclusively deployed for the rear seats. I’m 6’2” and sat behind my driving position and could really stretch out – the new Passat is almost palatial in terms of rear space. And, when it comes to boot space, VW says there’s 690 litres of space with the seats up. That’s the same as the upcoming new Superb (obviously) and bigger than any other estate on the market. With the seats folded flat, 1920 litres are up for grabs. Okay, let’s start with trims first, as there are three: Life, Elegance (the turquoise car pictured) and R-Line (the white car pictured). As for engines, VW offers mild hybrid petrols and diesels (with the more powerful models benefiting from 4Motion all-wheel drive) and two power variants of its eHybrid PHEV. The UK model line-up is detailed in the table below, with a blend of the 1.5-litre eTSI petrol (148bhp, front-wheel drive, seven-speed DSG auto) and the eHybrid models (201-268bhp). VW is keen to promote those eHybrid PHEV models. Not least because, as well as using a new petrol engine as part of the mix (a 1.5-litre TSI evo2, instead of an older 1.4 TSI), the battery size has grown by almost double (19.7kWh compared to 10.6kWh) meaning VW claims around 62 miles of e-range is available. That would make the Passat eHybrid one of the longest-range plug-in hybrids in terms of electric-only range. As well as boosting interior space, the deployment of MQBevo means more driving technology on board. As well as more sophisticated safety features and new headlight options (including smarter matrix LED ones), a new generation of VW’s dynamic chassis control (DCC Pro) features on the Passat. VW says the new DCC Pro will further refine the Passat’s handling characteristics. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

651,New 'Pro' spec chops £4k off Smart #1's entry price,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/smart/1/,Jake Groves,2024-01-26,Car Magazine UK,"Smart is back, but not as we knew it. The original urban mobility  brand has returned as joint venture of Geely and Mercedes, and it’s kicked this all-new chapter off with… an electric SUV/crossover. Who’d  have thought? Called the Smart #1, the new EV ‘retains the Smart spirit’ but fuses it to future-proof powertrain. Keep reading for more. Although Mercedes has handed over part of the Smart project to Geely (the parent company of Lotus, Polestar and Volvo among others) the  three-pointed star’s DNA is still obvious to see. Its 4270mm length, 2750mm wheelbase and 19-inch rims give it a unique stance, but #1’s headlights and rear lights clearly resemble other EQ models such as the  EQE and EQS. Other design ‘highlights’ include concealed handles and a novel halo roof, which gives the impression of decent interior space. Either way, the #1 carries on the Smart ethos of a picking and choosing bits of Mercedes and making them a little more ‘youthful’. Inside, you’ll find a mixture of Mercedes tech and funky, Smart  styling; A 12.8-inch touchscreen dominates the cabin and holds an AI-based infotainment system with a 3D interface – and it also uses a  robust Smart ID. Behind the wheel you’ll find a 10-inch HUD projecting  just above a 9.2-inch full HD instrument cluster. As for the AI? Think of all the things you can do with Hey Mercedes  in something such as an A-Class, and you’re pretty much there: air-con, ambient lighting and more. A 13-speaker and sub system, courtesy of Dr Dre’s Beats brand is also included, while a peer-to-peer system means owners can also verify other friends and relatives to use their Smart. It’s bound to get more intelligent, too; Smart says 75% of the car’s systems can also be upgraded via OTA updates. The Smart #1 rides on Geely’s new SEA platform, short for It’s the same platform underpinning Volvo’s new EX30. At the bottom of the ladder is a 49kWh battery model named ‘Pro’, with a single e-motor developing 268bhp and 253lb ft of torque. Smart claims a 193-mile range and a 6.7sec 0-62mph sprint, and says Pro is designed to make going electric more affordable. ‘Pro+’ and ‘Premium’ versions benefit from a larger 66kWh battery model, offering a range between 260 and 273 miles on the WLTP test cycle. Performance is the same as the ‘Pro’ model here. Then, to top out the range, there’s a hot Brabus version. This gets a dual motor, all-wheel-drive configuration. Thanks to its 422bhp output (compared the 268bhp single-motor rear-wheel-drive model) and 430lb ft of torque, it’ll hit 0-62mph in just 3.9 seconds. All models ship with a good amount of kit as standard. The Pro and Pro+ models feature a ACC, a panoramic sunroof, heated seats and a LED lights as standard, and the Premium trim adds a Beats sounds system, HUD and automatic park assist, as well a range of 273 miles – 13 more than the Pro+. The Brabus gets more aggressive styling, 19-inch wheels and a Brabus-themed interior. Unlike the lightweight ForTwo and the ForFour that proceeded it, the #1 is an all-electric SUV, and in many ways steps away from the traditional Smart template. It’s much larger than city cars that brand is traditionally known for, and although we’ve no price yet, the powertrain alone is sure to make the #1 the most expensive Smart ever. However, at the worldwide launch in Berlin, Smart’s suits were keen to point out the spirit of Smart remains intact. The emphasis is on premium value rather than all out affordability: ‘what people should know is this car has so much standard features in the standard line which is unbelievable,’ Smart designer Michael Gebhardt tells CAR at the 1#’s worldwide launch. ‘We have standard line LED lights, that is not normal. We have complete, fully-electric flush door handles. From the beginning we have ambient lights inside, and a 12.8-inch screen,’ he adds. ‘Everything is standard, and that’s fantastic.’ Prices start at £31,950 for the Pro model, rising to £35,950 for Pro+ and £38,950 for the Premium.

652,"2024 Skoda Kamiq prices confirmed, start from £24k",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/kamiq/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-01-26,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda has released the prices and opened up the order books for its new , the facelifted Kamiq. The Czech marque has confirmed that the base-spec SE model starts from £24,030, though for that price, customers can expect a lot of tech and other features as standard. The Kamiq SE comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, along with an 8.25-inch infotainment display and an 8-inch digital cluster display. Full LED headlights, rear parking sensors and keyless stop/start are also standard on the SE. For an extra £1,400, both the 1.0-litre 114bhp and 1.5-litre 148bhp engines available for the SE can be configured with a seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox. Like its sibling, the , the Kamiq is available in three specifications: SE, SE L and Monte Carlo. Moving up the range, the Kamiq SE L starts from £27,175 in its most modest 1.0-litre, 114bhp form, and features 18-inch alloy wheels, a 9.2-inch navigation display and a 10.25-inch virtual cockpit display as standard. A 1.5-litre 148hp version of the SE L is also available and starts from £28,565. At the top of the range, the sportier Kamiq Monte Carlo starts from £29,275 with the same 1.0-litre 114hp engine as the base-spec SE L while the upgraded 1.5-litre edition will set you back £30,665. A seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox is also available on the 1.0-litre 114bhp and the 1.5-litre 148bhp versions of the SE L and the Monte Carlo. The facelifted Kamiq will breathe new life into Skoda’s assault on the small SUV segment. It’ll offer renewed competition for the likes of the , and . However, it won’t be able to compete with its Stellantis rivals on the electrification front. The Kamiq is based on the same MQB A0 platform as the and , neither of which are available with any form of hybrid or pure-electric power. Deliveries are expected to start in the second quarter of 2024. Not much. Cosmetic changes are limited to a new front bumper with additional painted elements, reshaped LED headlights, a larger radiator grille, redesigned tail lamps and a new silver rear undertray. Those new lights are slimmer up top, larger lower down and that they will be available with LED Matrix technology for the first time. Skoda will also fit the latest version of its badging to the Kamiq’s tailgate and introduce a range of new alloy wheel designs. The exterior changes will be rounded off with an updated colour palette. Inside, the changes are mild, too. Skoda’s introduced some new upholstery finishes and a smattering of more sustainable materials around the car’s interior. All the company’s ‘Simply Clever’ extras (such as the umbrella housed within the rear doors and the ice scraper mounted on the inside of the fuel filler cap) also remain. The facelifted Kamiq will feature two new 1.0 litre TSI motors from Skoda’s more efficient evo2 family of engines. The cheapest model will have a 1.0-litre three-cylinder unit, the middling option will be powered by a 114bhp 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine while the top-spec car will receive a 146bhp 1.5-litre four-pot. All three engines will send drive to the front wheels. However, the 114bhp and 146bhp engines will both get six-speed manual gearbox as standard, while the 94bhp unit will need to make do with a five-speed manual.

653,"New 2024 Skoda Scala facelift: prices start from £22,095",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/scala-hatchback/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-01-26,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda has confirmed prices for the facelifted Scala. The updated version of the Czech company’s segment-defying will start from £22,095. UK buyers will be able to order their cars from October, with first deliveries expected to arrive in the first half of 2024. The facelifted line-up is separated into three specifications called SE, SE L and Monte Carlo. Even the cheapest SE model is well-equipped, though. Standard equipment includes 16-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and keyless go. Inside, there’s an 8.0-inch digital instrument cluster, an 8.25-inch infotainment system and dual-zone climate control. Skoda’s mid-range Scala SE L is priced from £23,895. Upgrades over the base-model include 17-inch alloy wheels, chrome window surrounds and rear privacy glass, while the interior features a larger 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster, an upgraded 9.2-inch infotainment system and ambient lighting. At the top of the range, there’s the sporty Scala Monte Carlo. Prices start from £27,795, which is quite a big leap from the SE L grade. However, it’s worth noting that you can’t have the Monte Carlo with the Scala’s entry-level petrol engine and that you get a lot more standard equipment. Upgrades include 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a rear-view camera and Matrix LED headlights with adaptive high beam and a cornering function. You also get a drive mode selector and an upgraded suspension setup with 15mm lowered springs and adjustable dampers. Now scroll down to learn more about the changes Skoda has made to its hatchback. Skoda has been quite conservative with the Scala’s styling changes, but the changes are there if you scrutinise the images hard enough. Skoda tells us its tweaks make the facelifted Scala look more like the concept from 2018 that preceded the car’s launch. The tweaks include a new radiator grille, slimmer LED headlights and a redesigned front bumper with a diamond-pattern lower intake. Skoda has also tickled the Scala’s rear end, adding a new undertray and some fresh LED taillights which available with dynamic indicators on Monte Carlo cars. Other, perhaps even less noticeable, changes include a slightly redesigned Skoda badge on the tailgate and a range of new alloy wheel designs. Yes. Skoda has taken the decision to use more recycled materials in the Scala’s cabin for the sake of sustainability. The car’s door panels and roof lining are trimmed in new fabrics made from natural hemp and kenaf (a type of hibiscus) plant fibres. The car’s seat upholstery, carpets and floor mats are also made from recycled materials. Skoda’s eco-conscious changes aren’t just limited to the interior, either, because the Scala’s windscreen washer bottle and wheel arch liners are also now made from recycled plastic. Like the pre-facelift Scala, buyers get a digital instrument cluster as standard, along with a central touchscreen in two sizes. There are up to four USB-C ports dotted around the cabin, too. There are three units in total, all powered by petrol. The cheapest option is a 94bhp 1.0-litre three-cylinder pair with a five-speed manual gearbox, which is somewhat of a rarity amongst new cars these days. Stepping up a rung, there’s a 114bhp version of the same engine. It’s priced from £23,070 and it’s paired with a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, although you can have a seven-speed DSG automatic for an additional £1395. The most powerful option is a 1.5-litre four-cylinder unit with 148bhp. It’s also fitted with a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, although you can have a seven-speed automatic for an extra £1350. The revised Scala also has an increased amount of standard safety equipment. Now, you get front assist with pedestrian detection, lane assist and traffic sign recognition. There are six airbags, too, although Skoda’s optional safety package can bring that tally up to nine. Buyers can also specify an optional safety piece of safety tech called Crew Protect. It’s a pre-crash system that prepares the cabin for an unavoidable impact by tightening the seat belts and closing the car’s windows. The updated Scala (and closely related ) are also the first vehicles on the VW Group’s MQB-A0 platform that will allow you to open the boot with a foot gesture. This optional Virtual Pedal comes as part of the Scala’s electric tailgate package. It joins existing ‘Simply Clever’ features such as the ice-scraper on the inside of the fuel filler flap and ticket holder on the windscreen. Skoda has expanded the list, though, adding new smartphone storage pockets on the front seat backs and a removable box on the rear of the central tunnel.

654,Video preview: Polestar 4 has lowest lifetime CO2 of any Polestar yet,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/polestar/4/,Alan Taylor-Jones,2024-01-31,Car Magazine UK,"Polestar claims its svelte new 4 EV is its cleanest model yet, with the brand’s own testing revealing that the 4 will produce 19.4 tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime, including production. Ironically, it’s also the fastest flavour of Polestar and will go head-to-head with the new Porsche Macan Electric and Tesla Model Y. Rather than just start with an SUV then replace the sensible square roofline with something more rakish, the Polestar 4 is a purpose-built Coupé that just so happens to sit a bit taller. And a bit taller is the right choice of words; the 4 shaves almost 8cm from the height of the Porsche Macan that it has firmly in its sights. This clean sheet approach has led to some interesting decisions being made, the most notable of which is the removal of the rear screen. That’s right, the tailgate has no window on it at all with the view taken care of by a wide-angle camera rear-view mirror (the door mirrors remain conventional). Parents with hyperactive children need not worry, a press of a button turns it into a regular mirror should you need to investigate any suspicious silences. Any concerns that the interior now resembles a coal scuttle with the reduced window count evaporate as soon as you step inside. All Polestar 4s get a massive panoramic roof that floods the cabin with light, with electrochromic elements optional should you want to block things out. Rear occupants get their own touchscreen to adjust the climate control and other functions, whilst the back seats recline electrically using buttons cunningly hidden on the side of the arm rest. Space is sufficient for a couple of 6’ 2” adults to be comfortable behind similarly tall drivers. Yes, although you’ll still need a conventional SUV or estate for maximum load lugging ability. Boot space below the parcel shelf is a decent 526 litres, but that roofline limits seats down space to 1536 litres, good but not exceptional. Move forward and you’ll find plenty of oddment storage on the two-level centre console but no glovebox or frunk for that matter. Unlike other Polestars, the 4 has its Android Automotive-based 15.4-inch infotainment system in a landscape orientation. That’s not an admission that other models are wrong, but merely to give the 4’s cockpit a wider, sportier feel. There’s also a 10.2-inch digital driver’s display and a 14.7-inch head up display to help relay information as clearly as possible. A sign of the car’s Swedish roots is a snow mode for the HUD that switches white text to yellow. Clever. We’re big fans of the Polestar 4’s interior ambiance, and that’s without seeing the new colour changing ambient lighting that’s inspired by the solar system. The different modes even come with some educational stuff for your kids, so they can learn about Mars, for instance. While we can’t speak about build quality until we’ve seen a finished production car, early signs are very promising. There are plenty of sustainable materials, but you’re not necessarily aware they’re there. Instead, the materials used feel at least as plush as a Porsche Macan Electric or BMW iX3 to give the Polestar 4 a very inviting interior. The 4’s SEA platform is provided by parent company Geely but will be thoroughly reworked by Polestar including some fettling in the UK. A chunky 102kWh battery pack is standard, giving a potential maximum range for the rear-wheel drive model of 379 miles. Impressively, the dual motor model with twice as much power should be good for 360 miles. Entry-level single motor cars get 268bhp and 253Ib ft of torque, enough for 0-62mph in 7.1 seconds and a 124mph top speed. The dual motor does a far better job of motivating this 2.3-tonne SUV. With power up to 536bhp and torque to 506Ib ft, 0-62mph is dispatched in a mere 3.8 seconds, or faster even than the more powerful Polestar 1. Single motor models get passive dampers, with the dual motor gaining ‘semi-active dampers’ for a sharper handling. Like the Polestar 2, a Performance Pack is available for the dual motor which adds four-piston Brembo brakes, bespoke chassis tuning, forged 22-inch wheels and Swedish gold detailing on the brakes, seatbelts and tyre’s valve caps. All versions get up to 200kW DC and 22kW AC charging capability accessed via a fancy motorised charging door. It takes just 30 minutes to get from 10-80% charged using a 200kW DC charger, while 0-100% takes five and a half hours on a three-phase 22kW wallbox. A typical 7.4kW wallbox will take over twice as long to top up. Alan became a 'professional' road tester in 2015, rising through the ranks to become head of automotive testing.

655,Hyundai’s Ioniq 7 electric SUV spied inside and out,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/hyundai/ioniq-7/,Jake Groves,2024-01-31,Car Magazine UK,"Here’s your most detailed look yet at the Hyundai Ioniq 7 SUV. Pictured winter testing by our dedicated spy photographers, Hyundai’s counterpart to the is well underway – and should be officially revealed in months. There’s not much to see thanks to the camouflage, but it strongly appears that the production Ioniq 7 will stick to the same styling shown on the Seven Concept shown below. Of particular interest are those vertical rear lights, that have a hint Volvo estate about them – combined of course with the retromodern pixel design that Hyundai’s design studio has become known for. Hyundai has form with true to concept production cars – just look at the Ioniq 5, and the Ioniq 6 from some angles… This time we’ve also got interior pictures of the new Ioniq 7 too: our new images show a cabin dominated by screens, just as you’d expect from Hyundai, with the same clean looking surfaces as the EV9, as well as the Ioniq 5 and Just like the Ioniq 5 and EV6, the Hyundai Ioniq 7 will share a E-GMP platform with the already released EV9 – and that means we can estimate some specs already. The Long Range EV9 has a range of up to 336 miles from a 99.8kWh battery pack. The largest GT Line model has a 0-62mph of just 5.3 seconds. Expect these to filter to the Hyundai at launch, or later down the line. For more on the Concept Seven, keep reading. Hyundai’s previewing another model for its Ioniq range with this: the Seven concept. It’s a large SUV with a properly futuristic design inside and out, with a focus on ‘hygienically focused functions’ – how very apt for these pandemic-ridden times. The brand is also trying to coin a new phrase: SUEV, or sport utility electric vehicle. We can’t help pronouncing it like Suez. Anyway, Hyundai has revealed the new concept SUV at the 2021 LA motor show, and we expect to see something encircling a production version Ioniq 7 from 2023 onwards to partner alongside the Prophecy concept-derived Ioniq 6. In a good way, to our eye. It’s similar in silhouette to Volvo’s Concept Recharge, with a stretched rear half and a bluff rear end. There are pixelated lights just like the Ioniq 5 front and rear, with a massive glass tailgate. Given it’s a concept, the wheels are enormous and the rear doors are rear-hinged for the best access into the cockpit. And again, like a concept, the Seven’s cockpit is designed like a lounge, with bench seating that curves around the rear end, as well as big lazy armchairs that move around. Similar to the , the interior is also full of recycled and sustainable materials. Mineral plaster and bamboo are applied inside, and the resin used to bond the panels is ‘based on renewable sources that can reduce pollution from the production process.’ Flashes of copper trim can be see, too. You read that right, yes. There’s a ‘hygiene airflow system’ similar to what you’d find on a commercial aircraft, where little vents in the Seven’s roof rails suck in air into the cabin and out via small vents in the rear wheel arches. Hyundai says this, along with UV light sterilisation while the car is empty (like how hospitals use UV light to sterilise wards) helps minimise cross contamination of bacteria and viruses while you’re inside. Certain storage areas have sterilisation functions, too. Hyundai Motor Group’s E-GMP platform. It’s the battery-electric architecture that’s already in service in the brilliant Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6, as well as the upcoming GV60. The platform is capable of electric all-wheel drive, with power outputs up to 600bhp according to Hyundai high-ups.

656,"2024 BMW M4 facelift revealed",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/m4/,CAR’s road test team,2024-02-01,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has refreshed the M4 and its drop-top counterpart, with small updates both cosmetic and internal. Beneath the bonnet, the M4’s 3.0-litre, straight-six engine has been upgraded to produce 530hp – a 20hp boost over the previous model and good to launch the car from zero to 62mph in 3.5 seconds in coupé spec (3.7 if you want the one with the roof down). Above the surface, BMW has re-energised the M4’s style with a new headlight design and taillights that feature laser diode technology to complement the cluster shape – a design akin to those found on the current M4 CSL. Sticking to the new car’s rear end, the surface on which the BMW logo sits has also been updated for an overall more elegant yet intense aesthetic. The wheels have been refreshed, too: M forged light-alloy wheels are available as standard – 19 inches up front, 20 inches at the rear – and feature a new double-spoke design with a silver finish for the first time. BMW M CEO Frank Van Meel has also confirmed that 2024 will see BMW M launching facelifted versions of the standard M3, in addition to the brand-new M5 and M5 Touring . For more on the new M4, keep reading. The previous BMW M4 coupe was unveiled in September 2020, amid much interest – and shock – around its new design treatment of the engorged BMW double-kidney grille (see below). It’s the M3’s swoopier sibling, but now features enhanced powertrains. The facelifted M4 still uses the 4-series’ controversial front grille arrangement but still looks very much like an M car; wide stance, fat haunches and quad exhausts. But there’s more to it than just looks. BMW has made some brave decisions as to what’s under the skin. Both new M4s feature the same enhanced straight-six engines, producing 530hp, 650Nm of torque and with an electronically limited top speed of 155mph. The engine itself is supplemented by BMW’s M TwinPower Turbo Technology to work in conjunction with xDrive, the marque’s AWD system. You bet. Starting with the wheel, BMW has flattened its lower edge while adorning the top with a red stripe for a breath of race car feel. Moreover, an M-style Alcantara finish is also available as an optional wheel finish for the first time, along with an optional heated version if you so wish. The new M4 features electrically adjustable M sports seats as standard. The dashboard and control panel now come in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite M trim as standard – carbon fibre alternatives are available as an option – while the upholstery trim is available in four Merino leather configurations and four colours. BMW has learned a lot from the M5 and M8, with the M4’s (and the M3’s) all-wheel drive system borrowing heavily from those larger M Division models. M’s take on xDrive powers the rear axle alone until traction is compromised. At that point an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer box steps in to optimise the front/rear power split, with the Active M Differential juggling the power left/right on the rear axle. The default mode, 4WD, is fast, grippy and more neutral than Audi’s quattro, on the M5 Competition at least. 4WD Sport is more rear-biased and the pick of the bunch for real-world use, combining any-weather traction with a degree of playfulness, while 2WD opens the door to, as product management man Hagen Franke puts it, ‘a lot of fun and a lot of smoke’. Production of the facelifted M4 will kick off in March later this year, with customer deliveries expected by April. CAR magazines staffers are the real deal: we love cars and know the industry inside out. Occasionally, we have to use a generic byline when too many of the team have contributed to an article."
657,BMW Z4: roadster given a manual gearbox,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/z4-roadster/,Jake Groves,2024-02-01,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has updated the Z4. But, as you’ve probably clocked by now, you may be here all day and not spot any differences – it took us a long time just looking at the pictures. But BMW says it has been, with a raft of mini updates dotted in and around its drop top including a manual gearbox as part of the Z4’s new Handschalter Pack. In Handschalter (literally hand switch) spec, BMW pairs the Z4 M40i’s in-line, six-cylinder engine with a manual gearbox for the first time. The package also includes new light-alloy wheels – 19 inches at the front and 20 at the rear. To complete the car’s sporty flavour, a new Frozen Deep Green metallic paint job has been thrown in that’s exclusive to this model in the Z4 family and evokes pure British racing heritage. Upgrades extend to the M40i’s interior too, and not just in the form of a gear stick to the driver’s side. Occupants won’t forget they’re in a relative of the M family as the Handschalter cabin features a number of M-themed details including black M upholstery piping and an M gear stick. For a touch of elegance, the pack includes a Vernasca leather trim in Cognac that’s exclusive to the BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse. Deliveries are expected to start in spring 2024. Okay, here goes. The auto Z4s will now only be available in either M Sport or M Performance spec, complete with a (very) mildly redesigned set of bumpers and new motif in the grille. New alloy wheel designs are available, as are three new colours. There’s also the new M Shadowline package that darkens the headlights and pairs with some black trimmings and black wheels. And that’s about it. The UK only gets two engines now: the sDrive20i and the M40i (with the middling sDrive30i model being killed off). The sDrive20i is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder developing 194bhp, good for a 6.6sec 0-62mph sprint. The M40i, meanwhile, has a 335bhp straight-six, meaning a potent 0-62mph launch time of just 4.5 seconds. Both are mated to an eight-speed auto as standard (models on the Continent and beyond can be fitted with a manual in certain markets) and send all their power to the rears. You can order a new Z4 now, and prices start from £43,795 for the sDrive20i. The hotter M40i starts from £55,570 while the Handschalter M40i starts from £60,675.

658,"BMW's hideous XM plug-in hybrid now features slower, less expensive 50e version",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/xm/,Jake Groves,2024-02-01,Car Magazine UK,"For those of you who were briefly lucky enough to forget this existed, we apologise. Yes, BMW’s XM SUV is back in the news as a new variant has been announced for 2024: the XM 50e. In case you need reminding what the XM is, it’s BMW M division’s flagship car and an absolute mammoth of a plug-in hybrid SUV. It was revealed in 2023, and largely repulsed a lot of automotive media and enthusiasts alike. We also , either – which dents our confidence of that will share the XM’s powertrain. Anyway, the new 50e is designed to drop the entry price and widen the appeal of the SUV. Instead of a V8 coupled to the e-motor, the 50e uses a straight-six instead. Total system power is rated at 470bhp, meaning a 5.1 sec 0-62mph sprint time – making the XM 50e one of the slowest M cars on the market. A circa-50-mile electric-only range makes it largely the same as the other XM models. It’s also about £40k less expensive in the UK, clocking in at £110,730. For context, a regular XM costs £150,270 in the UK, and the more potent and even more wildly-trimmed Label Red model will set you back £174,330. Bothered about those other XM models? Keep reading The XM is only the M division’s second bespoke project after the M1, and tops the multi-tiered cake of M models in a particularly controversial fashion. It’s a completely bespoke design and, frankly, one of BMW’s most unhinged – even by its own wild standards of late. But, more importantly, it’s also a plug-in hybrid – M’s first. The flagship XM model (not the lesser-powered 50e) consists of a new 4.4-litre V8 M TwinPower Turbo engine capable of 482bhp at 5400rpm and a peak torque figure of 479 ft lbs between 1600rpm to 5000rpm. An electric motor mounted to the transmission completes the equation, adding up to 194bhp and 206.5lb ft of torque. Add that all up and you have BMW M’s most powerful car to date. Like other hybrids, the XM is capable of capable of going to an electric-only EV mode, but for just 51-55 miles depending how gentle on the throttle you are. Top speed is EV-mode is limited to 87mph. The electric motor also means the XM can theoretically do 188.3mpg, so it’s not just about torque-filling. If you think that’s overkill, you’d be right; the XM uses the same drive concept that BMW will be using in its forthcoming LMDh racecar – though here it’s stuffed into an SUV-thing. The XM is capable of a 4.3sec 0-62mph sprint and is limited to 155mph. Power is funneled to all four wheels by an eight-speed Steptronic transmission. Driving modes will influence how it plays with the power: there’s usual Sport and Sport Plus modes that extract as much performance as possible, though here they’re joined by a Hybrid mode, and an Electric mode. Drive goes to all-four-wheels as standard, and there’s also DSC to improve grip in slippery conditions. BMW hasn’t specifically mentioned a ‘drift mode’ but it’ll most certain pop up. The XM is 5110mm long, and 2005mm wide – making it the widest car you can get from the brand.  It’ll use double wishbone front axle along with a five-link rear axle. As you’d expect electronic dampers will change the ride to suit your needs, and there’s also 48V active roll control to keep the car flat during faster corner. Like most cars in this sector, the XM always has rear-wheel steer, called Integral Active Steering in Munich speak. The XM’s hybrid nature means that it’ll use a brake-by-wire system that incorporates regen into the braking process. BMW says overall brake feel can also be modified depending on the driver’s wishes. Besides managing to make an ugly car even uglier? Not a great deal. Matte black paint with red detailing is everywhere, with bespoke wheels. Oh, and a plaque inside, telling you that you’ve bought one of the limited run of 500. There is a little more to it, though, as BMW has squeezed even more power out of the plug-in hybrid system. A total of 738bhp is available, dropping the 0-62mph sprint time down to 3.8 seconds. The top speed is limited to 155mph still, but can be lifted to 180mph via an option pack.

659,Paris targets its own Chelsea tractors by trebling parking fees for 'les 4x4 de ville',https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/paris-heavy-suv-parking-fees-weight/,Tim Pollard,2024-02-05,Car Magazine UK,"A referendum in Paris has voted to increase parking costs for heavy cars – meaning that SUVs and larger vehicles will be charged three times as much as today. Local media reports that parking a weighty 4×4 for six hours in central Paris could cost as much as €225 (£192). Anne Hidalgo, the socialist city mayor, launched the programme that targets the French equivalent of Chelsea tractors – ‘ ‘ – and 55% of residents voted for the measures. However, only 6% of eligible voters took part in the referendum on 4 February 2024, according to the authorities. The new measures voted overnight mean that any car weighing more than 1.6 tonnes will have to pay a new higher parking cost. Tickets for these vehicles, which include most SUVs and large cars, will rise threefold, to €18 (£15) for the first hour and rising to a maximum cap of €225 (£192) for six hours. Tellingly, this weight limit excludes most French SUVs made by Citroen, Peugeot and Renault – though the heavier, electrified models get closer to two tonnes. The DS9 1.6 E-Tense 4×4 weighs 1909kg. The new price applies to all combustion, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars. However, all-electric cars are allowed a heavier kerbweight of two tonnes. Parisians with resident parking permits are exempt from the charges in their home area. Disabled drivers, health workers, tradespeople and taxi drivers are also exempt from the new higher parking charges. Hidalgo said: ‘We are doing this to reduce pollution and to make our children safer because these cars are dangerous.

660,VIPER: the innovation that could keep your EV battery alive for longer,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/battery-range-estimates/,Seth Walton,2024-02-05,Car Magazine UK,"If the condition of your is keeping you up at night, there’s a new approach in the works to improve accuracy when estimating how much life an EV battery has left. According to those behind the project, not only could the new approach keep EV drivers safer but may also help to maximise the range and performance of their car. The project, glamorously known as VIPER –  Validated & Integrated Platform for battery Remaining useful life – is being carried out by a coalition between the tech outfit Eatron Technologies and the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) of the University of Warwick. With funding from the Faraday Institution, the two groups have brought the full might of their respective areas of expertise to the table. By combining WMG’s command of advanced electrochemical models with Eatron’s understanding of cloud battery management and integration, VIPER has produced remaining useful life (RUL) estimates with an accuracy rating of over 90%. ‘Unlocking the hidden capacity of a battery has the potential to increase an EV’s usable range and extend its lifetime,’ said Dr Umut Genc, CEO of Eatron. ‘There are benefits for the used EV market, too; as a result of these highly accurate RUL estimates, buyers could have confidence in the condition of a vehicle’s battery and be reassured about its ability to perform for many years to come.’ Just as EV battery tech is progressing with new innovations like , so too must the measures to keep us safe. If the natural degradation of a battery’s cells is not tracked closely, the battery can fail unexpectedly – an eventuality with potentially devastating consequences for both the car and the driver. As explained by the project team, current RUL estimates rely on voltage-based data that can miss complex battery failures. Conversely, others may cautiously report failures in a functioning battery pack, condemning it to replacement despite being in relatively good health. With accurate RUL estimates, however, it becomes possible to ‘extract the maximum performance and longevity from batteries, without compromising safety,’ according to Eatron. The two groups involved in VIPER are tech specialists but have expertise in different areas. Eatron Technologies develops AI-integrated battery management software to improve the performance and reliability of EV batteries over the course of their lifetime. WMG, is a department of the University of Warwick that collaborates in tech projects to drive innovation in UK manufacturing, while the Faraday Institution – the project’s primary benefactor – is a UK-based institute for electrochemical energy storage research. ‘Our support for UK-based efforts to develop cost-effective batteries that are efficient, fast charging, and can be safely and sustainably recycled is crucial to achieving the rapid growth in EVs on our roads that will see us deliver on our net-zero targets,’ said Professor Pam Thomas, CEO of the Faraday Institution. ‘The Eatron and WMG collaboration is a great example of the research and innovation elements of the Faraday Battery Challenge working together to deliver impact.’ Seth is a former staff writer across all our modern motoring titles, including CAR magazine and Parkers.

661,Audi’s RS6 Avant GT is an IMSA GTO-themed missile,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/audi/rs6-gt/,Jake Groves,2024-02-05,Car Magazine UK,"Audi has pushed its RS6 Avant to the bleeding edge with this: the limited-edition GT. The new, ‘ultimate’ RS6 features some extra performance kit and some heritage links to the Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO rocket ship from the late 80s. A lot of it is familiar territory for the RS6. It uses the same variant of the twin-turbo V8 as the model (so that’s 621bhp and 627lb ft of torque), for example , and it’s still all-wheel drive. With the GT, Audi says a 0-62mph time can be dealt with in 3.3 seconds, with a top speed of 190mph possible (compared to 3.4sec and 174mph with the RS6 Performance). But Audi’s engineers have introduced some more aggressive performance engineering to help make this still-over-two-tonne estate car dance with a little more finesse through the corners. For example, adjustable coilover suspension is standard, which Audi says includes triple adjustable dampers as well as 30 per cent/80 per cent stiffer stabilisers front/rear – designed to kill body roll. New Continental Sport Contact 7 tyres, specific GT tuning for the rear diff, the latest version of Audi’s centre locking diff and as-standard carbon ceramic brakes further boost the GT’s athleticism. The most obvious part, however, is its looks. As well as a carbonfibre bonnet and carbon wheelarches that feature air outlets behind the front wheels, a taller rear spoiler features. Arguably the tastiest bit of the exterior upgrades has to be the new, Avus concept-inspired 22-inch wheels – either available in white if you choose your RS6 GT in white or, if you go for the grey or black paintjob, the wheels are black. Bespoke bucket seats upholstered in leather and suede-like microfibre with stitched RS6 GT lettering also feature, as does a plaque on the centre console. For the full monte, though, Audi also offers the decal set pictured as an option – inspired by the Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO racer and the . Perfect for the wealthy car influencer type. Want one? It’s just a limited edition, with 660 examples being made. The UK has currently been allocated 60 of those – each costing a pretty potent £176,975.

662,"Bring back EV grants, create battery health standards and cut charging VAT, says Lords",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/house-of-lords-uk-government-report-2024/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-06,Car Magazine UK,"The House of Lords has published a new report that criticises the UK government’s approach to EVs – and warns that the UK will not meet its net zero carbon targets. However, it also raises some interesting solutions: targeted grants for EVs, VAT cuts for public charging and ‘battery health’ standards for used cars are just some of the actions floated in the 126 page document. ‘The evidence we received shows the Government must do more to get people to adopt EVs,’ said Baroness Parminter, Chair of the inquiry. ‘If it fails to heed our recommendations the UK won’t reap the significant benefits of better air quality and will lag in the slow lane for tackling climate change.’ The report welcomes some of the new measures post in place by local authorities such as the LEVI fund – as well as the attempts by car makers to incentivise EV ownership. However, data from sources such as the government’s Youth Engagement Programme, suggest more needs to be done – with higher costs and overall clarity being key causes of concern for prospective buyers. Much of the report’s suggestions are around clarifying information and messaging around EVs, as well as reducing the cost gap between EV and ICE ownership. At the purchasing stage, the report recommends the reintroduction of targeted grants to increase parity between ICE and EV powertrain. A rethink of road taxation is also advocated, to make the process of buying an EV both simpler and more financially beneficial. The report states that 62% of consumers surveyed by the Green Finance Institute cited concerns about battery lifespan, despite batteries often guaranteed by the manufacturer for longer than the car itself.  Therefore, the report puts forward a two-pronged approach; with better comms around batteries, alongside a standardised method of testing battery health. In this case it appears things might be a little more on track; the report asserts the industry is developing tools to increase the speed of battery conditions tests, and that the government is already exploring ‘options for improving the availability and standardisation of information for consumers on used EVs at the point of sale.’ How long it’ll take these standards to come to fruition remains to be seen. The report also suggests that the discrepancy between public charting VAT rates and domestic charging rates should be removed to reduce ownership costs: domestic charging currently carries a VAT of 5%, while public charging incurs a higher 20% VAT rate. Although the report acknowledges the government’s investment into increasing the public charging network, it highlights outdated and flat-footed planning procedures as contributors to a slower turnaround than you’d hope for. Streamlined planning regulations are just one of the ways the new report advocate to speed things up. Keeping the EV at the forefront of battery technology is also a key factor in the report, and that’s across the entire lifecycle of the EV; from battery development all the way to the recycling process. The government is already due to release a new report on the state of the EV manufacturing industry by mid-2025. The report also notes that more investment and development will be needed to bring the UK up to speed on EV recycling, as it currently lags behind there too. While joined-up policies between government departments is the most obvious choice, the report floats the idea of a Ministerial Taskforce designed purely for supercharging the UK’s EV efforts, as well as deciding its direction. While much of the report is suggestions, it’s not all doom and gloom; it states that it is ‘still possible to ensure a successful EV transition that enjoys the confidence of the public and makes the necessary contribution to the UK’s net zero targets.’ However, this will need to be done sooner rather than later if the UK is to remain at the forefront of electric vehicles and sustainable transport.

663,Arrival: company behind futuristic UK electric van start-up goes into administration,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/arrival/,Tom Webster,2024-02-06,Car Magazine UK,"UK-based start-up Arrival has gone into administration a week after it was removed from the New York stock exchange. The company has called in Simon Edel, Alan Hudson and Sam Woodward of EY-Parthenon’s Turnaround and Restructuring Strategy team after it failed to secure emergency funding. As many as 172 jobs are at risk as the Arrival UK Ltd and Arrival Automotive UK Limited subsidiaries are impacted. The other arms under the Arrival company are continuing to operate outside of the administration process. The administrators will look to sell off elements of the business, including the electric van platform, software, intellectual property and R&D assets as it seeks to repay creditors. Arrival has faced several problems in recent years, and the entering into administration represents a fall from grace for the company that was once briefly valued at £9bn on the stock market. The 2022 Q2 earnings revealed that the company had cut back its delivery goals to just 20 vans for 2022, which was down from around 400 to 600, which was the aim as recently as April in the same year. It reported losses of $89.6m (£73.8m) in the second quarter of 2022, which was up from $56.2m (£46.2m) in the same quarter in 2021. As well as the delayed opening of the Charlotte microfactory, the company had reportedly paused its car and bus plans. That said, the Arrival Bus had reached the stage where it is operating on public roads, ferrying employees from site to site. The Banbury-based operation was designing and engineering the future of all-electric commercial vehicles and buses. It was named the number one start-up to work for in the UK in 2020 by LinkedIn, orders for the van were flooding in from the likes of UPS and Royal Mail, and First Group – one of the biggest bus operators in the UK – was in talks with Arrival, too. Hyundai Motor Group invested €100m (£85m) in Arrival to gain access to its EV engineering. ‘It’s the culmination of six years of hard work, and the team feels incredibly proud,’ says Tom Elvidge at the time, Arrival’s senior vice-president of vehicle programmes. Its van, Arrival’s first major project, was designed in a range of shapes and sizes, with battery capacities ranging from 44 to 133kWh. Arrival estimated the van can do up to 215 miles on a single charge – plenty for a Royal Mail operative to perform a number of local delivery rounds, for example – and carry up to two tonnes. And then there’s the bus. The design is modular, with different lengths and battery ranges easily integrated into the matrix. Flat surfaces and sanitation stations (the bus was revealed during the first wave of the Covid pandemic in 2020), along with wall-mounted panels with contactless payment functions, allow passengers to get on and off smoothly. Real-time updates via GPS tracking can be sent to your phone while you wait. How did a start-up like Arrival offer such flexibility in its products? It’s all down to the way they’re built. ‘We’ve designed our own components on a modular, grid-based system for simple assembly,’ says Elvidge. ‘Each component can be used across all of Arrival’s platforms, allowing manufacturing at scale and rapid development of new vehicle types.’ The start-up also isn’t one for centralising its production; instead, Arrival was aiming to set up several ‘microfactories’. The plan was to buy up warehouse space near where demand is highest, to produce vehicles locally, transforming the space into small production hubs for whatever vehicle is required using something Arrival calls ‘cell-based assembly’ – a small footprint of square space in the microfactory designed to build one vehicle from the ground up. No rolling production lines or tight time deadlines, just the set of components put together by both robotic arms and humans. There were set to be four in the world initially. ‘Cell-based assembly means we can create any vehicle from the portfolio, quickly being able to reconfigure the same plant to build different products,’ says Elvidge. ‘If demand for a particular product wanes, we can switch to a different one. ‘Microfactories make distribution and production cheaper, easier and more sustainable,’ he adds. ‘They’re designed to be long-lasting facilities and, combined with Arrival’s in-house hardware and software, will lower costs to such an extent that our products will be competitive on price with fossil-fuel equivalents, and have a much lower total cost of ownership.’ The next project? An electric car, designed purely for taxi use. Arrival is working with Uber, the ride-hailing giant, to design the ultimate EV for its drivers and passengers. ‘Ride hailing plays such a key role in creating accessible and efficient transport systems,’ says Elvidge. ‘An integrated transport ecosystem will create cleaner solutions for people living in cities.’ All this looks uncertain with the administration announcement, however. Tom Webster is our Vans Editor, as well as being the Deputy Head of the Bauer Digital Automotive Hub, meaning he has a keen focus on all things vans and automotive ownership."
664,New i5 Touring: BMW’s first electric estate launches after saloon,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/i5/,Jake Groves,2024-02-06,Car Magazine UK,"BMW has launched an i5 Touring estate model to sit alongside . The new battery-powered version of BMW’s 5er (don’t worry, combustion ones still exist) might be the biggest leap for the car in its five-decade, 10 million sales-strong history. Like , it’s been launched in tandem with the new, G60-generation 5-series which you can read about by clicking here. Keep scrolling for all we know about the new i5 saloon and Touring estate. Only slightly. It’s still an evolutionary design rather than a radical one, particularly given how important the 5-series is to the brand. For the i5, visual differentiation from other 5-series models is less pronounced than with other twinned BMW i models besides the 7/i7 twins. Both the i5 saloon and Touring have grown in every direction. The saloon is 93mm longer, 35mm wider and 24mm taller with a 20mm stretch in the wheelbase, and that growth largely extends to the Touring, too. The i5 also benefits from the aero trickery as the 5 (including optional Air Performance wheels, active kidney-grille vent control and a smooth underbody), too, meaning a low-drag 0.23Cd coefficient. The i5 uses a lot of technology and design inspiration from the larger, and really rather opulent, i7 cockpit. BMW’s Curved Display, which debuted , returns with familiar 12.3-inch and 14.9-inch screens running back-to-back behind a common glass surface. BMW has also introduced ‘Veganza’ – a vegan, leather-like upholstery that’s standard from launch. Real leather is relegated to the options list. BMW’s electric exec also gets the reworked 8.5 operating system just like the i7, with a focus on improved usability and eight ‘QuickSelect’ widgets to make the most frequently used features easier to access without dipping into sub-menus. There are also games, courtesy of a tie-up with AirConsole, so you can positively relish those charger queues. While the saloon offers 520 litres of boot space, the Touring model provides 570 litres via a much wider opening. The Touring includes a powered tailgate and powered seat folding included as standard. Two i5 versions are confirmed so far, using a 400-volt architecture. The i5 eDrive40 is a rear-drive model with a single 335bhp electric motor and a range of 309-362 miles for the saloon/300-348 for the Touring, good for a 0-62mph sprint in 6.0sec (the Touring is 6.1sec) and a top speed of 120mph. The i5 M60 xDrive upgrades to four-wheel drive with twin e-motors and its 590bhp is punchy like a Porsche Taycan GTS, dropping the 0-62mph launch time to 3.8 seconds (3.9sec for the Touring) while the top speed rises to 143mph. The M60’s range on the WLTP test cycle is expected to be 282-320 miles (277-314 for the Touring). In both cases a model-specific lithium-ion battery pack with a usable 82.3kWh can be charged at up to 205kW, while a Max Range mode offers a limp-home safety net to boost range by 15-25 per cent. Handy when that charger you banked on pulls a sickie. As you’d expect, though, the i5 is not a light car. The eDrive40 saloon, for example, clocks in at 2130kg. But BMW’s Daniel Mögele says the battery enhances the dynamic experience: ‘We integrate the i5 battery pack as the core of our driving dynamic concept, so we mount the front axle carrier to the battery with shear plates, and the rear axle carrier with a strut system.’ We’ve driven a prototype of the i5 so far, and found it’s a big car with a rigid platform that responds to steering inputs as one connected whole. The e-motors are familiar BMW fifth-generation hardware, controlled with the same kind of seamlessly integrated slip control logic as the latest 1-series and i4 – clever tech that juggles grip and slip so deftly I can’t feel it working on fast, neat laps in the M60. The familiar CLAR underpinnings are common to all 5-series, with the i5 benefiting from air suspension as standard. Adaptive M Professional is the most advanced chassis and is fitted to the M60 as standard, combining rear-wheel-steer wizardry with active roll stabilisation (aka active anti-roll bars with 48-volt electric motors). BMW’s used all the tech before, but never before combined them. Beyond the AirConsole interior entertainment and the latest upgrades to the BMW OS system inside the car, the i5 can be had with thoroughly up to date driving assistance kit. Automated Lane Change with eye activation is a world-first, for example, but there’s familiar hands-off driving, active cruise with traffic-light recognition and remote-control parking among 40-plus systems from the 7-series. BMW’s i5 saloon is already at UK dealers, while the Touring will start arriving in the summer of 2024. A new Sport Edition specification drops the entry price of the i5, with the Touring version starting at £69,040.

665,Ford’s refreshed Puma proves the ‘if it ain’t broke’ rule,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/puma/,Jake Groves,2024-02-07,Car Magazine UK,"The phrase ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ exists for a reason. And yet, it seems Ford has decided to ignore that advice when it comes to facelifting its Puma crossover for 2024. Ford’s Puma is a huge seller – the bestselling car in the UK in 2023 – and is known for its keen handling, relatively no-nonsense (if a bit low-rent) interior and potent, fun Puma ST model. While we can’t say too much on how the updated Puma drives just yet, on paper, those other two points have been considerably messed with. This facelift comes as Ford prepares to launch a pure-electric Puma, which is due later in 2024. Our intel suggests the electric Puma – which will run with a ‘Gen-E’ nameplate ­– won’t change much visually compared to the cars that still use combustion engines like we see here. But, instead of giving its massive seller a meaningful refresh that fixes the niggles people have with the pre-facelift car, it’s giving us things we arguably don’t want. Go figure. And that’s how they hook you in. Besides some slightly different front DRLs and new wheel designs, there really isn’t much at all to tell the pre- and post-facelift Puma apart by exterior design alone. It’s still a dinky crossover that is now Ford’s smallest car given the demise of the Fiesta, and it still features clever details like the MegaBox – an additional 80-litre compartment beneath the boot floor. The interior itself, which was a bit of a weak link for the Puma, has been given a proper going over. And, if you’ve got your 2024 facelift bingo card with you, you can strike off ‘buttons replaced with screens’. Instead of a neatly laid out, if a little tinny, dashboard with physical climate control switchgear and a modest-but-usable screen, Ford has installed a large 12.8-inch digital display as standard in all Puma models, as well as a rather large 12-inch central infotainment screen. Doing so has removed pretty much every physical button from the Puma’s interior, besides the ones that feature on the new twin-spoke steering wheel. The Puma’s 1.0-litre EcoBoost engines are all badged as ‘hybrids’ now, despite them only being so in the mildest sense. If you go for a regular Puma, you can choose from a 123bhp version with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic, or a 153bhp model available with that seven-speed auto only. Those of you who are fans of Ford’s ST models, as we are, will be bitterly disappointed by the refreshed Puma ST. Gone is the 197bhp 1.5-litre, manual gearbox firecracker that’s well liked (especially given it was one of few remaining sporty Fords remaining) – all we’re left with is the fairly bland 168bhp automatic model. This ‘ST Powershift’ model was introduced pre-facelift and , particularly because it’s slower and less engaging than the fantastic manual one. So there you go: a lesson or two in how to make a great, high-selling car less great. Then get yourself in line. Prices start at £25,790.

666,"Alpine F1 bounces back with totally new, aggressive A524",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/a524-f1-car/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-08,Car Magazine UK,"You’re looking at the Alpine A524, the car VP of Alpine Bruno Famin hopes will get the Anglo-french team’s F1 offering back on track. Revolution more than evolution, it’s a significantly more aggressive car than the A521, but it needs to be: 2023 was not a gear for Alpine. Instead of closing the gap to third place, it fell to sixth, behind the slow-starting but highly-energised McLaren team as well as Aston Martin. Instead of closing the gap to third place in the constructors’ championship, Alpine  fell to X behind the slow-starting but highly energised McLaren team – and was even further behind from Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull. Rather than building on a flawed concept (we’re looking at you Brackley) Alpine decided to chuck everything out and start again.  ‘We decided to take very bold approach,’ said Matt Harman, the team’s technical director at the launch. ‘It’s a brand-new car from front to back, I think I think only the steering wheel survived. We’ve really tried to look at every single area of the car to make sure that we leave no stone unturned.’ Sharper, with a wide nose and even aggressive sidepods than the previous car, the A524 displayed is close to the one the team will be using in two weeks’ time at the Bahrain test; unlike most teams, Alpine didn’t want this to be a mere livery launch. Harman went on to explain just how hard the team have worked on the floor and bodywork – and the internal body work too. The new car will also benefit from more, track-specific parts than before. Alpine is keen to emphasis it’s nowhere near the limits of the car – and there’s still lots to be refined and extracted from its bold new concept. If McLaren taught the paddock anything last year, it’s that it’s not where you start, but where you finish. Although the Woking car was poor at the beginning of the year, it was arguably the second fastest by the end – and it’s this constant rate of in-season development Alpine is targeting. ‘We need give ourselves a car that can have can potential throughout the year,’ Harman agrees. ‘We plateaued a bit with the A523, and with this car, I think we have that potential.’ Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly will be hoping the new car is far more competitive than before, but they’ll be especially interested in the balance of the new car – as that was the main issue with last year’s car: ‘I think I think there’s been little bit of an issue with the balance of the car in general, that was not possible to fix’ Ocon tells us. ‘There was always a part of the corner where we struggled with one axle, and we were never able to fix the whole radius of the corner,’ Ocon explains. ‘At times we had to take the corner in two goes – or three goes. And now we just want to arrive, brake, turn and do it in one go.’ ‘I’m sure you know, with the new concept, this is what we’ve tacked. It’s going in the right direction in the simulator, but it needs to happen in reality,’ he said. And it seems Ocon’s teammate Gasly is asking for the same thing: ‘Even though we’ve got slightly different driving styles, we’re still asking for pretty much the same,’ says Gasly. ‘We have the same requirements for for the car. So it makes things quite a lot easier for the team. At least they know which directions they’re going to add to and what they’re going to provide us.’ The elephants in the room, though, are the 2026 regulations which will feature significant differences in the engine and chassis side – with the former rules already firmed up. With that in mind, new Alpine VP Bruno Famin already has his sights set on 2026 on the powertrain side (with new sporting code additions prohibiting teams starting on the chassis in advance). What’s more, two new positions have been brought into manage the day-to-day in Viry and Enstone, and Famin has also improved the trackside operation at Alpine. ‘I’ve already one and a half eyes on 2026 because the project started quite a long time ago,’ Famin admits. ‘We have some guidelines for the new regulations, but we don’t have them yet – they’ll made mid-2024, as per the international sporting codes.’ And of course, we are well working together; Enstone, Viry analysing potential performance what will be the duty cycle, the profile of speed.’ With new rules already on the horizon – which represent an opportunity for OEMs that make the chassis and the powertrain – Alpine’s bold, untested 2024 concept can be seen as a calculated risk. With just two years of these rules left, and last year’s A523 a dud, Alpine’s best move was to hedge its bets, and work on the non-metal side, such as development culture and trackside operations in 2024 and 2025.

Alpine A424 hypercar is ready to race,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/alpine/hypercar/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-02-08,Car Magazine UK,"Yesterday, Alpine revealed its all-new A524 F1 car, but it shared the stage with this; the A524 Hypercar. Now under development for one and a half years, the program has some significant signings under its belt, and forms one side of Alpine’s two-pronged attack into motorsport. It’s only the second OEM to do both the World Endurance Championship and Formula One in parallel: it’s just Ferrari and Alpine for now – but they’ll both be joined by Aston Martin. At yesterday’s launch the team confirmed it’ll run two cars, and also revealed which drivers will drive which. The #35 car will be driven by Paul-Loup Chatin, Charles Milesi and Ferdinand Habsburg, while the #36 car will be helmed by Nicolas Lapierre and Matthieu Vaxiviere and Mick Schumacher. Keep reading for everything else you need to know about the Alpine A424. The new Alpine A424 was unveiled at the , in which the brand will field two cars in the slower LMP2 class. But when this new Hypercar hits the grid in 2024, it’ll compete against some of the fastest cars in the series from the likes of Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota. Alpine’s Hypercar is built according to , which allows teams to compete in both the FIA World Endurance Championship and the North American IMSA Sports Car Championship with the same car. Teams can choose from one of four chassis on which to base their racers – and there are some strict regulations governing their aerodynamic performance, weight and power output. LMDh rules state that Hypercars can’t weigh any less than 1,030kg, their power output is capped at 670bhp and they all must have a 50kW hybrid system. Downforce is strictly regulated, too. Naturally, though, Alpine has min-maxed all these stats in an effort to make the most of the series’ rulebook and ensure the A424 is competitive in the race. LMDh regulations stipulate that, while a Hypercar’s chassis, hybrid system and transmission must be pulled from a pool of standard parts, its engine must be made in-house. The A424’s engine was a collaborative effort between Alpine and the French engineering company Mecachrome. It’s a turbocharged 3.4-litre V6 with an 670bhp and a redline of 9000rpm. Christophe Chapelain, Alpine’s Hypercar LMDh project chief engineer, says his team will be the only one running a car with this engine configuration on the grid. He also says the A424’s engine drew on the experience gathered by Alpine’s Formula One racing exploits. ‘It must be noted that the synergies with F1 are such that our LMDh software is strongly inspired by F1,’ he said. ‘The F1 cost cap also works in our favour, as it frees up dyno hours in addition to those available at Mecachrome.’ Alpine also borrowed a few of its Formula One engineers to help piece together its Le Mans Hypercar project. Racing teams have a little more freedom here. LMDh cars must comply to strict aerodynamic principles but, as long as they meet the rules, their styling can be at the whim of the team’s designers. So, when Alpine was blueprinting the A424 with Oreca (another one of its engineering partners), it tried hard to inject some of its road car DNA into the project. Chapelain said: ‘From the outset, [Oreca] have been tremendously reactive to our demands whilst providing us with a wealth of information for the engine integration. As for the chassis, it’s the first time they’ve dealt with so much input from car designers. Compromises had to be made, between the desire for design and certain regulatory aspects for example. ‘However, the aerodynamic window leaves enough room to incorporate many ideas whilst converging towards the required windows. We had to reunite two different worlds and the result is magnificent. It shows that everyone has worked in the same direction to make this project successful, not only in terms of style today, but also on track tomorrow.’ To keep weight down, the A424’s bodywork is made entirely from carbon fibre. Its styling also seems to riff off the ideas proposed by Alpine’s hydrogen-powered (pictured on the right of the image above) which, in turn, previews the company’s styling language for its next generation of road cars. The A424’s front light bar is remarkably similar to the concept racer, as is the shape of its cockpit and its rear end. Alongside its new Hypercar, Alpine also unveiled a special edition version of its at the opening of the 2023 Le Mans race. It celebrates the 100 anniversary of the iconic endurance race and will be limited to just 100 examples worldwide.

668,Lotus Emeya electric GT heads winter testing ahead of autumn launch,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/lotus/emeya/,Tim Pollard,2024-02-09,Car Magazine UK,"The new Lotus Emeya arrives on sale in Europe in the second half of 2024, a few months after China, and the car maker has just completed its winter testing programme in Ivalo, Finland, 150 miles inside the Arctic Circle. Slip-slidey cold-weather testing makes for some eye-popping photographs and it’s a chance to prove the Emeya’s sporting credentials, as much as its engineering hardiness in -25C chill. CAR has now sat in the fast four-door and can confirm that the build quality is on another planet from earlier Norfolk-built models. The Lotus Emeya will be manufactured in China, not Hethel, as with other high-riding lifestyle Lotuses. It’s the new super-saloon EV that continues Hethel’s headlong rush to electrify its range at pace. It’s a dramatically different four-door to take on rivals from Tesla and Porsche, not to mention the triumvirate of German mainstream premium brands. The Emeya badge continues the long tradition of Lotus names beginning with the letter E stretching all the way back to the Eleven. But that’s where the common thread of history is broken: like the e-SUV, the Emeya will be neither light nor a sports car, but ushers in a new type of Lotus that embraces zero-emissions sustainability yet doesn’t forget its athletic roots. Hethel has not yet published the full specs for Emeya, but we know it shares the same fundamental EV hardware as the Eletre, which tips the scales at 2520kg. The saloon is lower and will therefore almost certainly be lighter, but don’t go expecting a kerbweight under two tonnes. Developed under codename , the Emeya saloon reflects the company’s rapid expansion into different types of bodystyle and niche under Geely ownership. It was unveiled at a glitzy event in New York on 7 September 2023, purposefully picked to underline this car’s global ambitions. ‘Bringing together our rich heritage with intelligent performance and the latest cutting-edge technologies, we’re pushing the boundaries for how a luxury electric vehicle should look and handle – making it truly for the drivers,’ said Feng Qingfeng, the CEO of Lotus Group. It’s a large four-door saloon dubbed a ‘fully electric hyper-GT,’ designed to rival the , Mercedes-Benz EQE and Audi e-Tron GT. The use of the same electric skateboard architecture as the Eletre means it will come as standard in dual-motor mode, with peak power of 893bhp and maximum torque standing at a heady 727lb ft. Yes: those are head-spinning outputs, placing the Emeya up there with the most violently accelerative BMW M cars or anything that Mercedes-AMG or Audi’s RS department can offer. The new 2024 Lotus Emeya will be blindingly quick: Hethel confirms the fast four-door will sprint silently from 0-62mph in 2.8 seconds and top speed is capped at 159mph for the sake of the battery cells’ health. Remember: a contemporary F1 car accelerates from 0-62mph in around 2.6 seconds, only two tenths faster… What we used to call in-gear acceleration is just as vicious. Acceleration from 50-70mph take less than two seconds, suggesting that this saloon is geared towards performance as much as long-legged cruising. Permanent all-wheel drive is governed by Lotus ICC intelligent torque distribution, the poor black box whose job it is to marshal all that thrust into forward progress without spilling off the road. Meanwhile, active dampers monitor the road conditions 1000 times a second, helping them adapt quickly to bumps and lumps in the tarmac (older readers may remember Lotus playing with active ride all the way back in the 1980s). The Lotus Emeya has been given a lot of careful aerodynamic sculpting to cleave the air with minimal drag; note how door mirrors are swapped for cameras and there’s an intricate aero package keeping the Emeya squashed to the tarmac. Take the front grille area; active aero flaps open or shutter, depending on whether the car needs minimum drag or maximum cooling, just like on the Eletre. The rear spoiler is also active and, at 296mm wide, it’s 10cm broader than the Eletre’s to create a greater surface area – contributing to total downforce of more than 215kg at speed. If you find the exterior styling of the new-generation Lotuses different, wait until you step into the cabin. There’s a significant step forwards in interior quality and features compared with what went before and we were impressed when we sat in the demonstrator at the London flagship store in Piccadilly. It feels luxurious, well screwed together. And just look at those camera-based mirrors; a digital screen is integrated into the front of the door card, rather like in the diminutive . It’s as far removed from a pared-back Lotus Elise cockpit as you can imagine, as it should be for a sporting limousine. There’s an in-house touchscreen infotainment system, a world-class Kef stereo with Dolby Atmos 3D surround sound and even road noise-cancelling soundwaves, to counter road and wind racket. We’ve yet to drive the Emeya, but we’ve a sneaking suspicion it’ll be super-refined. The rear seats can be specced with a bench or two captain’s armchairs, which electrically recline. It’s not massively roomy back there, truth be told, with taller passengers’ heads and legs both clipped by the package. Take note also of the 55-inch projected augmented reality head-up display (HUD). Geely’s parentage is a huge boon here – the Chinese behemoth’s parts cupboard and budget aligning perfectly with Norfolk’s decades-old engineering prowess to come up with some interesting technical innovations. This includes the hardware for Level 4 autonomous driving: Lotus is equipping its next-gen electric cars with the tech required for self-driving, including 360deg lidar, ultra-rapid Nvidia processors and seven high-def cameras to monitor traffic around the car. The lithium-ion battery in the Emeya has an enormous, long-legged (and presumably heavy) 102kWh capacity for a range that is likely to stretch beyond 350 miles. The final claimed WLTP EV range has not yet been confirmed, so that’s our best guesstimate, and Lotus admits ‘Emeya range is expected to be broadly similar to that of the Eletre.’ When it comes to recharging, an 800-volt electrical architecture means that the Lotus Emeya will be no laggard when it’s plugged in. Capable of charging at up to an astonishing 350kW DC, it’ll add 93 miles in just five minutes, according to Lotus – while the benchmark 10-80% charge takes a scant 18 minutes (assuming you can find these mythical ultra-rapid chargers in Britain).  No wonder Lotus types talk of as much as old-fashioned 0-60mph times. Production is set to begin later in 2024. No prices have been announced yet, a Lotus presentation seen by CAR put an estimated price of $100,000, equating to around £80,000. Once fully up to speed, the company forecasts annual sales of 30,000-40,000 Emeyas a year globally, just behind the Eletre SUV. Lotus claims a forward order bank of 19,000 orders for the Eletre and Emeya, fueled by a growing dealer network that’s already past 200 outlets and will surpass 500 by 2025.

669,"New Aston Martin Vantage unveiled – 656bhp V8, new interior and no hybrid",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/vantage/,James Dennison,2024-02-12,Car Magazine UK,"The Aston Martin Vantage is the entry-level sports car of the British manufacturer’s range – yet one look at the key stats and you’d have a hard time believing it. Headline figures are 656bhp from a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8, with corresponding improvements to the chassis hardware and driver assist technology, as well as a comprehensive overhaul to the cabin. The latter was one of the last generation model’s weakest areas and let down what was otherwise an excellent sports car with a broad range of talents. Unfortunately for Aston, the list of rivals is exceptional and includes the , Mercedes-AMG GT and, to a lesser extent, the Bentley Continental GT and Ferrari Roma. Will this latest version of the Vantage be able to compete? Read on to find out. To say the new Vantage has been treated to a spot of copy and paste styling from the previous generation car would be unfair, yet the general shape and image (especially at the rear end) is very similar. That said, the body is 30mm wider and the grille almost 40% larger. Look closely and you’ll also spot a wider front splitter, additional air intakes at the front end, larger exhaust tips and a new Matrix LED headlight design. The latter differs significantly from the smaller, narrower lights of the old car and gives the new Vantage a front-end look much more in-keeping with its DB12 big brother. What’s more, the side strake on the front flank is more prominent and the standard wheel size is up to 21-inches. If the exterior is a relatively gentle evolution in design, the cabin upgrade is far more significant. Gone are the days when users were forced to work with an old Volvo or Mercedes-Benz infotainment system, with the new Vantage featuring Aston’s own unit first seen on the DB12. Sufficed to say it’s a vast improvement over what came before it, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, as well as 3D mapping, What3Words integration and the ability to connect your car with the official AM app. Thankfully, in addition to the 10.25-inch central display and equally sized digital dash, the Vantage still comes with a healthy amount of shortcut buttons and dials that should make adjusting functions on the move much easier than delving into a touchscreen. The engine start stop dial doubles up as a drive mode controller, while buttons for the adaptive dampers and exhaust valves also take a prominent position on the centre console. Meanwhile, the driving position feels much like it did in the previous Vantage with a nice, low-slung base looking out over a long, wide bonnet. Adjustment is ample and the cabin itself should be large enough for most adults. Our initial look at the Vantage was with a prototype vehicle so we can’t make a final verdict on quality, yet there were a few cheaper-feeling elements including the buttons on the steering wheel and some of the trim around the door cars. As such, we suspect the quality will fall comfortably short of a Porsche 911, yet it’s a strong overall improvement to the cabin nonetheless. Many will rejoice in the fact that the AMG-sourced 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 remains without being touched with the almost inevitable electrification element that’s touching many ICE performance cars. That said, power and torque is up considerably from 503bhp and 505lb ft to a head-turning 656bhp and 590lbt foot. As a result, 0-62mph is down to 3.4 seconds and top speed is said to be 202mph. All fed to the rear wheels only via the tried-and-tested eight-speed ZF auto transmission. Sadly, there’s no sign of a manual version, yet the ZF ‘box has been treated to a shorter final drive ratio and revised shift calibration in order to deliver better shift times and in-gear acceleration. Meanwhile, the engine achieves its higher outputs via modified cam profiles, a better compression ratio, larger turbos and, naturally, a redesigned cooling system. This features an additional low temperature radiator and two further auxiliary coolers, with the amount of cold air reaching said radiators increasing by around half. Incidentally, Aston offers a 1770W Bowers and Wilkins 15-speaker 3D sound system with the Vantage, yet we’d hope and expect this to be made redundant when the V8 is on song. Final verdict on that in the upcoming review… The previous Vantage wasn’t all about straight line speed – it impressed in the corners too – yet Aston’s pushed ahead with improvements to the chassis to keep it in line with its lithest of rivals. We’re talking an aluminium structure, 50:50 weight distribution and efforts to improve torsional rigidity. For example, the front cross member has been moved back – thus improving mounting point stiffness for the double wishbone front suspension – while the stiffness between the suspension towers has also been improved at bot the front and rear. New DTX Bilstein adaptive dampers also feature and deliver five times the bandwidth of force distribution as the previous gen. Bringing this together with the electronic driver aids, of which there are many is the Active Vehicle Dynamics control system which sounds a little but like the six-way Chassis Dynamic Sensor on a Ferrari 296. What it does is measure the car’s movement across a number of different axis and, using this information, acts on the brakes, powertrain and E-Diff to deliver the perfect amount of ESP intervention. In addition, Adjustable Traction control has been added and, along with off, on Wet and Track ESC modes, the ATC can disable the ESC’s yaw control function and deliver varying levels (from 1-8) of traction control intervention on the throttle. This, in theory, enhancing the possibility of lairy power slides. One question, however, is all of this does for the Vantage’s weight? The old car came in at 1,530kg dry. The new car gains 75kg and measures 1,605kg dry – essentially the equivalent of carrying a passenger around at all times. Not bad given all the additional strengthening and tech that’s been loaded on. Aston appears to have played the new Vantage very intelligently. It’s kept the things we liked from the previous edition (big V8, handling) and supplemented them with additional firepower and tech, while going back to the drawing board on things we didn’t like (the cabin). What’s more, the exterior styling has been given a welcome makeover that neatly brings it in line with other Aston products. All that’s left, is to confirm that the character of the old car remains and the various performance and chassis improvements translate into the real world. If they do, then Aston Martin should have a winner on its hands. James heads up our automotive video activities in the UK and is responsible for video on CAR magazine.

670,"The CAR Inquisition: Brabus CEO, Constantin Buschmann",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/brabus-constantin-buschmann/,Piers Ward,2024-02-12,Car Magazine UK,"Constantin Buschmann’s life seems to be the stuff of dreams. Born into German tuning royalty as a result of his father founding Brabus, Buschmann was just 34 years old when he became the firm’s CEO and now lives the sort of glamorous, car-fuelled Insta-life that could make Lewis Hamilton jealous. But as with every social-media profile, that element of the story is only skin deep. In reality, Buschmann has had to grow up fast. His father Bodo Buschmann, who owned the company for 41 years, died suddenly in 2018, leaving Constantin to deal with his grief and also plan a future for one of the most famous names in the tuning world. The fact that we’re still talking about Brabus five years later shows that the plan came off. Buschmann has pushed the brand into ever more diverse markets, maintaining its heartland of tuning Mercedes-Benz and Smart while also morphing into motorbikes (in a tie-up with KTM) and even powerboats. Brabus has always had a reputation for the extreme, but it’s clear that Buschmann is pushing it further. In 2022 the Crawler was unveiled, a bespoke off-road buggy for people with a lot of sand in their back garden. While riffing on Mercedes G-Class styling, it’s entirely a Brabus, with all the risks and rewards inherent in doing your own thing. ‘When you look at the company’s mission now, it is what we call a Brabus one-second-wow. Whether someone stands in front of a Brabus Rocket for the first time, or a Six-by-Six or Shadow 900, it’s very clear they are Brabus products. There’s a design language carry-over that works. They support your individuality.’ He’s unconstrained by the history of the brand. ‘There are a few more ingredients that we consider important for the recipe of creating a one-second-wow. And the interesting thing is what does it not contain? It does not contain a car, it does not contain four wheels. It does not contain a steering wheel. That’s given the company a new focus.’ In this new existence, just because Brabus didn’t do something in the past is no longer a reason why it won’t do it in the future. ‘Customers were coming to us and saying, “I love your cars. I know your sales guy. I have a 911 – please can you work on it.” We always said no because we work on Mercedes-Benz. And I thought is there a reason we’re not doing it? If you as a company say you’re not doing it because you’ve never done it is not good enough.’ Is Brabus stretching itself too thin? ‘If we don’t pay attention to our roots and to our core mission then yes [there is a risk].’ But Buschmann is bullish about Brabus’s prospects, investing more than ever before and with a clear vision of what is needed: ‘I always say to the team that if we don’t fail enough, we don’t experiment enough… we cannot become a company that does everything.’ The clarity stretches to the very ownership of the company. Buschmann is proud that Brabus stands independent of any car maker but he’s not so arrogant that he can’t see change might come. ‘Can we do all this [the continued expansion] and remain independent? Up to now – yes. But it could change in two scenarios. We could lose it, for internal or external circumstances. Internally, I can’t see them at the moment. Externally, of course, that stuff can always happen with unpredictable circumstances. ‘The second scenario is that we have ideas that we cannot realise as an independent business because we need more money to do it. And that will put us on a path where we would probably IPO or get an investor.’ The relationship with Merc remains the same but the company is on a different path to the one Buschmann’s father was treading. He’s aware of the ‘backpack of responsibility’, but knows he has to make his own way; sad that his dad died, but with an awareness that opportunity came from it: ‘It [my father’s death] meant a very clear-cut transition from one generation to the next.’ It allows Brabus to have clarity. ‘If you and I were brothers and we had a company together, the communications complexity would just have risen 100 per cent. Two people with two opinions, two perspectives. What Brabus needed in 2018 was drive, speed and energy. My father passed away way too early, but the business needed a fresh perspective and an outlook for the next few decades.’ CAR magazine's deputy editor has a penchant for automotive adventure and trading in quirky, often-unreliable old cars.

671,Cheese grater sidepods and better straight line speed: the AMR24 is just the beginning for Aston Martin’s 2024 F1 season,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/aston-martin/amr24/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-13,Car Magazine UK,"Aston Martin has just revealed its new 2024 F1 car, and it looks and sounds like it’s going to be a significant step up over the often-promising 2023 car. Designed, once again, under the technical leadership of ex-Red Bull man Dan Fallows, the new AMR24 promised to be a level above the car that shocked the paddock in the early part of 2023. Aston Martin came out of the blocks incredibly strongly last year; leapfrogging both Mercedes and Ferrari in the early races – and this car looks even more extreme. Just look at those sidepods! ‘We’ve made changes all over the car, it’s a very different car in many ways,’ said Fallows. ‘We’re very pleased with the step that we’ve made over the winter, we think we have made a step on last year’s car.’ ‘The obvious things you will see that are different, are things like the front nose and front wing – and the bodywork will be different,’ Fallows explained. ‘But there’s also obviously quite a lot of stuff under the hood… We will obviously try and keep some of that under wraps.’ That’s what I’m calling them, anyway. The most eye-catching changes on the AMR24 are the new sidepod inlets, which look to be even more extreme evolution of the ones we saw on the Red Bull in the second half of last year. Rather than ‘gulping’ air and feeding it to the engine and other systems, these new inlets seem to slice air off as it moves along the top of the car – much like a cheese grater. The most obvious effect is an even sleeker car, and you’d imagine there’s now less drag in that area. ‘We’ve inherited new suspension from Mercedes, they give us the gearbox and the structure of the rear suspension.’ Fallows continues. ‘So that has changed slightly from last year as well.’ While the AMR23 proved strong at the beginning of the season, it had some key weaknesses, and it’s these that the MAR24 targets front and centre: ‘Straight line speed and making sure the car as efficient as possible has been a big focus over the winter,’ said Fallows. ‘And I think that is something that we’ve we’ve managed to achieve on this year’s car and make a step on that.’ Straight line speed is something both Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso complained about last year, so both drivers (returning for 2024 at least) will be happy with that aspect of the new car for a start. The biggest problem for the AMR23 however, was the quality and quantity of in-season development Aston’s technical team were able to bring to it. Simply put, Aston Martin wasn’t able to add performance to it at the same rate as the rest of the grid – and some of the new parts seemed to go in the wrong direction. It’s this in-season development issue that Aston is most interesting in fixing with the AMR24: ‘This is the first step in this season. We want to make sure we’ve got a good platform for development. And that’s what we’ve been really focusing on,’ said Fallows. ‘I think we’ve managed to achieve that.’ Of course, it’s not just the car. One of the reason Red Bull was so dominant last year wasn’t just because of Adrian Newey’s design – but the trackside operations, and even the processes back at base. Now, with a new facility and a car that looks to be competitive, it’s even more important to get right: ‘We have really tried to look at every area, be it a car be its operations, speed or reliability, to make a step forward in all directions,’ said team principal Mike Krack. ‘We hope we have done enough, and we are sure that we will have a strong contender.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more."
672,MS-RT creates the ultimate Ford Transit Custom and Ford Ranger,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/ford/transit-custom-ms-rt-and-ranger-ms-rt/,Tom Webster,2024-02-13,Car Magazine UK,"The and Ford Ranger have been given a thorough going over by performance specialists MS-RT. The result is two vehicles aimed firmly at the small business that wants to catch the eye of the whole neighbourhood while they are parked outside your house on a job and get away sharpish. The Ford Transit Custom MS-RT and Ranger MS-RT take an otherwise sensible van and pick-up truck and douse them liberally in motorsport kit, including striking external paraphernalia, LED light strips, widened arches, huge alloys and daring colours. Unlike some range-topping versions of the past, though, these are more than just visual updates, with upgrades to power and suspension also included. The MS-RT-version of the UK’s best-selling van, the Ford Transit Custom, is available in all three powertrain variants – diesel, electric and the forthcoming plug-in hybrid. The rear-wheel-drive electric version gets the most notable upgrade, with a 285hp power output – a huge step up from the 218hp of the standard Sport model. This makes it the most powerful Transit Custom yet. Ford does say that you can dial this back to 215hp in Normal mode or 134hp in Eco to make the most of the range. It hasn’t clarified exactly what this range is yet, but it may well dip slightly from the official maximum of 203 miles of the standard version. The plug-in hybrid and diesel power outputs remain unaltered, at 232hp for the PHEV and either 170hp for the all-wheel-drive automatic model or 150hp for the front-wheel drive manual model. Outside they all get a bespoke front bumper with integrated spoiler, sports side skirts, and a rear bumper with integrated diffuser. There is also a motorsport-inspired rear spoiler with a split in the middle so each half opens with the rear side-hinged doors. The electric model also gets an LED light strip between the headlights. The wheels are 19-inch alloys that are half an inch wider than standard and help shed half a kilogram of unsprung weight at each corner. They sit in wider arches and are shod with Goodyear Eagle Sport tyres and there are blue painted brake callipers hiding beneath. Inside it gets MS-RT seats with side bolsters, logos and blue stitching (below). A sports steering wheel also comes with more blue details and stitching. The bright colour palette includes a start yellow green and an MS-RT blue. By dubbing the Ford Ranger MS-RT the ‘ultimate street truck’, Ford isn’t hiding away from the fact that this is not a pickup that is likely to be heading down the tracks at your local quarry. It too comes with the most powerful diesel engine from the standard Ranger, the 240hp 3.0-litre V6, and adds four-wheel drive and a range of equipment. This includes a front fascia that is inspired by the Ford Thailand Racing that take part in the Thailand Super Pickup Series. This includes a honeycomb grille with integrated front splitter. The profile gets side skirts while the rear features an integrated diffuser on a bespoke bumper. There is also a ducktail spoiler and another spoiler on the top of the cab, which combine to boost aerodynamics to enhances stability at speed. The alloy wheels are the largest ever fitted to a Ranger at 21 inches and they feature low-profile tyres. These sit in widened arches that boost the overall width of the vehicle by 82mm front and rear. The suspension has been optimised for the MS-RT model, with firmer dampers up front and a retuned setup at the rear. This results in a 40mm reduction in ride height and a claimed boost to stability in corners. Inside you get similar seat and steering wheel upgrades as in the Transit Custom MS-RT. The new Ford MS-RT Ranger is available to order now, with deliveries expected to begin in the summer. Both are set to start at around £49,000 before VAT is factored in.

The brand says the new Ypsilon is part of its plans to make itself seen as a ‘desirable, respected and credible brand,’ and includes a range of new EVs that take advantage of the new Stellantis group’s STLA platforms. Which is deliberate, to make people talk about it. The new Lancia has plenty of design elements from the , including and interpretation of the concept’s tri-DRL face and rear lights inspired by the Stratos. This big-alloyed, blue-coloured model is the first edition: the ‘Edizione Limitada Cassina’ that’s limited to 1906 units. Inside, Lancia has made an effort to make its supermini feel different, with a range of posh materials and loads of standard kit. The brand says that every Ypsilon features a 10.25-inch infotainment display, as well as ‘the best standard parking assistance system, and the greatest exterior lighting system’ of cars in the same class. Details include a ‘cannelloni’-style pattern on the seats and a unique table-like centre console to make the interior feel a little more lounge-ish. It won’t just be, but the Ypsilon launches as an EV. Given it’s one of a lot of cars within the Stellantis mega-corp structure, the Ypsilon shares the same platform (e-CMP), powertrain and technology as cars like the , and to name just three. That means the Ypsilon features a 152bhp e-motor that drives the front wheels, a 51kWh battery pack and a claimed range of 250 miles on a single charge. As for charging, Lancia says the Ypsilon can go from 20-80 per cent in 24 minutes. Given Stellantis’ current strategy, expect a petrol combustion version to be included in the range at some point in the future – likely the 128bhp 1.2-litre mild hybrid model seen in other cars. If you live in certain European countries, yes. For a long time Lancia only sold its sole car in Italy but, for this new Ypsilon, the brand says it’s expanding into Belgium and the Netherlands in 2024 when the car launches later in the year, with Spain and France following after.

676,KGM Torres: The SsangYong with a new name,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/kgm/torres-suv/,Ted Welford,2024-02-19,Car Magazine UK,"SsangYong is back with its first new product for some years, and it’s even got a new name to go with it – KGM Motors. This is the KGM Torres, its . The Korean carmaker promises a new lease of life for this SUV brand, and the Torres arrives in the UK as its first new car – a mid-size SUV that brings a rugged look and more technology. There will be an EV down the line, too. SsangYong was close to financial ruin before being rescued by huge South Korean chemical and steel company KG Group in 2022. The rename is said to signal a ‘new era of innovation’ and it was officially renamed to KGM Motors UK in December. So, we lose another weird and wonderful name with SsangYong, and in place we have KGM, with its dealers already rebranded to reflect the change, and its new metal, the Torres, already in forecourts. Named after the Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, the Torres is a new SUV that will sit towards the top end of KGM’s line-up, above the Korando and below the Rexton, if you can remember what those are, that is. The Torres is quite different to the rest of the lukewarm metal that SsangYong, sorry we mean KGM, makes, with an almost Jeep-like look about it, courtesy of the slotted grille and sharp creases and edges. It’s bigger than you might expect too, as at 4.7m long, is similar to a . Inside, the Torres gets a modern new look, with the now-trendy twin-screen setup, incorporating two large displays. KGM also says the Torres ‘sets the industry standard’ for boot space, measuring 703 litres with the seats upright, and 1663 litres with them folded. Yes, though you’ll have to wait a little bit longer as the Torres launches first with a turbocharged 1.5-litre petrol engine producing 161bhp and 207lb ft of torque. KGM promises a dazzling 10 per cent improvement in acceleration compared to the older engine in the Korando. A six-speed automatic transmission is the default, and while front-wheel-drive initially, an all-wheel-drive version will come in the summer. It will be April by the time the electric EVX version launches, which packs a 73.4kWh battery, good for a claimed 287 miles between the charges. KGM looks to be trying to eradicate SsangYong’s budget roots, with prices for a Torres kicking off from £34,995 for a K30 trim. It does come with a comprehensive list of equipment, with a 12.3-inch touchscreen, 9.0-inch digital dial display and ‘luxury’ leather seats included. The top-spec K40 brings big 20-inch alloy wheels and an electric boot, though starts from £37,995, and it’ll be another £3000 if you want four-wheel-drive. KGM is yet to announce pricing for the forthcoming EV. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
677,VW’s new ID.7 Tourer is the biggest electric estate car so far,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-7-tourer/,Jake Groves,2024-02-19,Car Magazine UK,"Volkswagen has launched its first battery-electric estate car: the ID.7 Tourer. The new EV wagon promises plenty of space and lengthy pace as well as featuring a glowing face. Why ‘Tourer’? Previous VW wagons have either just been called (or ‘Variant’s in Europe) or, in the case of the Arteon, . Well, according to VW’s name wizards, the ID.7 Tourer’s low-drag body shape design is meant to be somewhere between the two, and VW wants to imply to potential buyers that it’ll go a long distance, too. You can go on real , geddit? Anyway, it’s fair to assume that a lot of the ID.7 Tourer is already standard with . The long, sleek bodywork and solid-feeling interior remain, as does a pretty leggy powertrain. Like the regular ID.7, the Tourer can also be had with a clever panoramic glass roof with an in-built, polymer-dispersed liquid crystal shade (much like ) and the new-generation MIB4 infotainment system will very soon include ChatGPT functionality augmented into the IDA voice assistant. Well, let’s start with the elephant in the room: the additional boot space. That inflated backside compared to the regular ID.7 allows a maximum boot space of 605 litres with the seats up or 1714 litres with them folded down, making the ID.7 Tourer the biggest electric estate car in terms of boot volume. An – arguably the ID.7 Tourer’s closest rival manages 570/1700 litres with the seats up/down, while other EV estates currently on sale like the and , and s or the don’t come close. Maybe Audi’s upcoming could best it. The ID.7 Tourer is the first car in VW’s range to feature both a front rear glowing logo (the Touareg was the first to have a rear one and the Mk8.5 Golf was the first to have one at the front) and it debuts VW’s new Wellness app. The Wellness app lives inside the infotainment system and works similarly to Mercedes’ Energising Comfort system ( ), using light, sound, HVAC and massaging functions to either freshen you up, calm you down or even help you nap while the car charges. As well as a 77kWh battery pack, the Tourer also introduces a larger 86kWh battery (which will also become available on the regular one), with the latter promising to boost range up to 427 miles. Go for the 77kWh battery and you can charge at up to 175kW on a DC charger, while the 86kWh version can be zapped with up to 200kW. Regardless of battery, the ID.7 Tourer launches with one rear-driven e-motor for now, developing 282bhp, but expect an ID.7 Tourer GTX to arrive later this year. Not until later in 2024 for the UK, with orders likely opening up in the summer. While prices are unconfirmed, naturally expect a slight price difference between the Tourer and the regular ID.7.

678,Government slams brakes on plans to hike pick-up truck taxes,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/pickup-truck-uk-car-tax-bill-benefit-changes-july-2024/,Tom Webster,2024-02-19,Car Magazine UK,"The UK tax authorities have climbed down on plans to close the loophole that allows with a payload of greater than one tonne to be taxed as a van, not a car. The move, was announced quietly yesterday by HMRC on 12 February, but just one week later it has equally quietly confirmed that it has reversed its plans. The idea was to treat pick-up trucks as cars and therefore calculate their company-car tax on their CO2 emissions, which could have sent costs soaring by more than five times. This would surely have had a drastic impact on the popular pick-up truck market and resulted in lower sales, as well as leaving thousands of small businesses and sole traders massively out of pocket. For around two decades, private individuals have been able to run pick-ups as company cars and pay significantly less benefit-in-kind than if they were a regular saloon, hatchback or SUV. However, in released on 12 February 2024, HMRC signalled its intention to rescind the tax break on all new pick-ups ‘purchased, leased or ordered’ from 1 July 2024. Just a week later, on 19 February, HMRC issued a statement saying: ‘The government has listened carefully to views from farmers and the motoring industry on the potential impacts of the change in tax-treatment. The government has acknowledged that the 2020 court decision and resultant guidance update could have an impact on businesses and individuals in a way that is not consistent with the government’s wider aims to support businesses, including vital motoring and farming industries.’ This is reassuring, but raises the question of why such a huge announcement was made with so little consultation done in advance. The statement went on to confirm that everything will be remaining exactly as it was, so nothing has changed at all despite the planned huge revamping of the tax system. Pick-ups have been classified in the grey area between passenger cars and vans for some time. Popular with farmers, self-employed traders and rural types, they have proved a hardy workhorse and the UK taxman has historically judged that trucks with a payload in excess of one tonne are closer to commercial vehicles than private cars. The automotive industry responded with a raft of ever-plusher pick-ups, especially the double-cab variants with an extended cabin allowing two rows of seats. HMRC argued that these were now used more often as private cars than working trucks – and decided to close the tax loophole for company car drivers. This completely ignored the many motorists that have legitimate business need for a pick-up truck that can carry several workers and a load of equipment into areas that a van can’t reach. HMRC was punishing those many users in order to clamp down on a few that had taken advantage of the loophole. It said: ‘From 1 July 2024, HMRC will no longer interpret the legislation that defines car and van for tax purposes in line with the definitions used for VAT purposes,’ the paper says. ‘This VAT approach for double-cab pick-ups differentiated based on payload, with anything under one tonne classified as a car, and anything a tonne and over as a van. This rule was replicated as a pragmatic way of resolving the primary suitability and classification of double cab pick-ups.’ The point of law at play is a hearing at the Court of Appeal in . The court found that the use of crew vans meant that supposed commercial vehicles were in fact suitable as private cars too, providing a benefit-in-kind to company car drivers who could use them for family and leisure purposes as much as work. ‘As a consequence [crew vans and their ilk] failed to qualify as goods vehicles and were classified as “cars” for benefit-in-kind purposes,’ the HMRC noted. CAR magazine predicted that the UK’s pick-up market would have undergone significant change in the years ahead had the tax hike come in. There was a planned grace period – all trucks bought or ordered before the 1 July switchover would have been classified under the existing system. As a result, it was likely that sales of double-cab pick-ups would have blossomed in the run-up to this date before falling back, potentially dramatically, as the tax advantages of running a double-cab as a company car disappeared. Of course, the advent of all-electric pick-up trucks – including the likes of the and , not yet officially sold in the UK – will reshape the argument naturally, as company EVs qualify for even lower benefit-in-kind charges than commercial vehicles. One solitary electric pick-up truck is sold in the UK today: the Maxus T90EV. Others are in the pipeline, including the and a is coming in 2025. Any electrified truck is a good bet to help reduce running costs and potentially benefit-in-kind bills. Government policy looked like it was going to massively reshape an entire sector of the automotive industry, as well as many others that rely on the vehicles affected. Instead, the opposite turned out to be true as industry fought back and shaped government policy.

679,Filling in the name: Volvo to streamline its EV naming system,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/volvo/ev-badging-streamline/,Seth Walton,2024-02-20,Car Magazine UK,"Some car manufacturers update their models so often that the naming system struggles to keep up. Volvo can be considered as among this group, as it’s only now setting the record straight with a new streamlined and standardised set of names for its (EV) range. The fully and models will be known as the EX40 and the EC40 respectively, as use of the E character becomes inextricably linked to Volvo’s electric cars. Any and C40 will continue to use their original designation, while the Recharge brand is being removed altogether from plug-in hybrid models. These cars will be designated with a T6 or T8 suffix to reflect their power output only. According to Volvo, the naming system has been standardised to make the model range easier to understand for new and existing customers, while reflecting the marque’s ambition to become an ‘By aligning our trailblazing first electric models with the rest of our electric car portfolio, we simplify choice for consumers as we continue to electrify our line-up and refresh our hybrids,’ Björn Annwall said, Chief Commercial Officer and Deputy CEO. But the EX40 and the EC40 aren’t just receiving new names. Volvo is updating the two electric cars with a new Performance software package to up their power rating by 25kW and improve accelerator response times with new pedal mapping. If you’d like to spec your electric family SUV with a touch of ominous doom, the EX40 and EC40 and XC40 are also now available in Black Edition trim, which dresses the car in an Onyx Black paint with black badging and a charcoal interior.

680,New Artisan GT-R is a modern-day Skyline tuned by Litchfield,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/artisan/gtr/,Ted Welford,2024-02-20,Car Magazine UK,"Fed up with waiting for a new ? A British firm might have the answer with its interpretation of this JDM icon, the Artisan GT-R. Revealed at the back end of 2023, the Artisan GT-R aims to offer design cues from past Skylines, and it’s now been confirmed that renowned will be working its magic on the car. While you can still buy a in corners of the world where environmental concerns are pushed down the priority list – the US, namely – you haven’t been able to a showroom-fresh R35 in Europe since 2022 when tighter noise regulations forced it to come to an abrupt end. With still no signs of any R36 GT-R, Artisan aims to bridge the gap, taking inspiration from with this new car. Based on an R35 GT-R, all body panels are removed and then reskinned in the ‘best quality’ carbon-fibre, helping to drop the kerb weight, though not surprisingly there are few figures available yet. The design is pretty effective, looking like a believable Nissan facelift that successfully manages to hark back to Skyline GT-Rs of old, especially the R34. There’s a cool vented bonnet and a striking new light signature made up of horizontally arranged LEDs. The interior gets a big new touchscreen, a modern  improvement on the R35’s usual drab switchgear. It’s all too easy to get sceptical about restomods, as many disappear sooner than they arrive. But one thing that tells us Artisan is serious is that it’s got specialist tuning firm Litchfield to do the mechanical fettling. Using the GT-R’s VR38DETT engine as its base, it is rebuilt with several upgraded parts, such as the intercooler, intakes, injectors and GT3 turbos. There will be a flagship ‘Ultimate Edition’ as well, which gets an increased 4.1-litre engine displacement, as well as larger roller bearing turbos and highflow fuel pumps. This version also gets a rebuilt transmission and upgraded clutch. It appears to mean business. Litchfield also replaces the GT-R’s usual quad-exit exhaust system with two huge pipes, while customers can also choose a Bilstein suspension setup and Alcon brakes from the extensive options list. Though it sounds a bit like a posh Soho bakery, Artisan Vehicle Design is the idea of Roman Miah, a Coventry University automotive design graduate. Though the registered address is to a rather nondescript location in Southall, West London, manufacturing of the Artisan GT-R will take place in Hannover, Germany. The firm says customers can bring in their existing R35 or a car can be sourced for them. Artisan ‘estimates’ that the cost for the standard GT-R conversion will be £369,000, with the Ultimate Edition coming in at £389,000.

681,New Prius arrives in the UK this summer with plug-in hybrid power,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/toyota/prius/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-02-20,Car Magazine UK,"The new will soon be available to buy in the UK, with prices for the sleek starting from £37,315. As you may recall, Toyota performed quite the U-turn after originally saying that it wouldn’t bring its new fifth-generation Prius to the UK due to falling demand for this type of vehicle, which was once the default choice for minicab drivers up and down the country. But that decision has changed, and soon the Prius will be back on sale in the UK – and we’re genuinely excited about it. At launch the new Prius will come in two trim levels, and the sole option of a 220bhp 2.0-litre setup. The more traditional variant is yet to be given the green light for the UK. Prices kick off at £37,315 for the Design trim, with a pretty comprehensive list of equipment including 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control and keyless entry. Above this is the £39,995 Excel trim, bringing big 19-inch alloy wheels, an electric boot and electric, heated and ventilated seats. You also get a digital rear-view mirror. It certainly seems more Uber Lux than Uber X. Orders for the new Toyota Prius open on 4 March 2024, with first deliveries expected from July this year. Toyota must have some plans for the Prius, as the recent sales were not exactly barnstorming. The company registered just 563 Prius hybrids in Britain in 2022 and they were mostly sold to minicab operators, not more lucrative retail customers. Compare that number to the 18,000 hybrid crossovers sold in 2021 and you begin to understand the challenge Toyota faces. At the time of the axing, a spokesman told CAR: ‘With our evolving UK product strategy and changing market conditions, we have taken the decision not to introduce the new-generation Prius in the UK as the new model represents a very different proposition to its predecessor – alongside a clear shift in UK consumer demand towards more SUV-style vehicles. So what changed? Toyota UK has never given any official reason, but recent slowing EV sales and an increased demand for hybrid vehicles will have no doubt played a part in the U-turn. As will the strong reception this stylish and high-tech new Prius has received ever since its first reveal at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show. The Prius is arguably one of Toyota’s most iconic models, but it’s now embattled by hybrid and PHEV rivals from all sides. So the new Mk5 Prius has had the kitchen sink thrown at it – from Toyota’s latest electrified powertrain and design cues from the electric crossover to make its design less alienating. It’s part of Toyota’s new design era, kicked off by a range of concept cars and the bZ4x EV, the company’s first EV. The wedge shape of the Prius remains intact, it’s 50mm taller with a 50mm longer wheelbase, and it’s 22mm wider than the last generation. Inside, it’s full of design details and equipment shared with the bZ4x, too, including the small steering wheel and high-mounted driver display that’s meant to be viewed above the wheel, not through it (a little like Peugeot’s i-Cockpit design). A large central touchscreen features, too. The plug-in powertrain in the new Prius PHEV is one major reason to get excited by its imminent arrival – not something you can historically say about a Prius. The new model has a 2.0-litre petrol engine and an e-motor making a combined 220bhp – punchy by Toyota’s usual standards. This means a 0-62mph time of just 6.7 seconds. There’s also a new, bigger 13.6kWh battery pack which, Toyota promises, means an electric range of up to 53 miles, and exceptionally low CO2 emissions of 12g/km. Unlikely, but it would be cool, right? Although given that Toyota now offers a GR Sport version of its Hilux pickup truck, it is possible that there will be a sportier version of its hybrid hatch. Revealed at Le Mans 2023 to celebrate the race’s 100th running, the Prius 24h Le Mans Centennial GR Edition is essentially a tuned-up version of the Uber favourite and also highlighted Toyota’s commitment to hybrid tech. The new Prius is already a striking car, but this model goes one further thanks to a raft of motorsport-derived parts; you’ll find everything from side skirts to a large rear wing and diffuser if you scan the pics. The Prius’s track has been widened, and it now runs on 235/50 R18-inch tyres with aerodynamic wheels. Toyota has also added additional driving lights – because Le Mans.

682,We try Personal Pilot - BMW's most advanced autonomous tech,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/bmw-personal-pilot/,Tim Pollard,2024-02-21,Car Magazine UK,"The step from Level 2 to Level 3 self-driving cars is small on paper but hugely significant on the road. Much discussed over the past decade, ‘eyes-off’ systems have not materialised on schedule. Remember the Audi A8 promising Level 3 readiness back in 2017, only to be hit by regulation roadblocks? But 2024 looks like being the year when it really happens, at least in some countries. BMW has just launched its Personal Pilot L3 as a €6000 (£5200) option on the 7-series in Germany, although it’s not yet approved for use in the UK. We tested it at the company’s new autonomous driving R&D base at Sokolov in the Czech Republic. A quick recap on which is based on Society of Automotive Engineers guidelines. The L3 bit of the BMW system’s name refers to Level 3, which means ‘conditional automation’ – a mode that lets all aspects of driving be done for you, but the driver must be on hand to intervene. Envisage a ‘driverless’ car – a fully autonomous robocab – and you’re thinking of Level 5. That is some way off; the reality is that human/machine handovers will be the norm for a while yet. And that’s exactly where this latest upgrade to Personal Pilot sits. We jump into an i7, select a YouTube video on the infotainment and pull out to join a throng of cars on a simulated motorway. Once cameras and sensors confirm we are on a suitable highway, the Personal Pilot button illuminates on the steering wheel. One tap, then audio and visual confirmation, and the car takes over. I watch the TV screen, hands off the wheel. It’s uncanny, and I’m unnerved that the i7 tracking my eye movement and steering inputs doesn’t intervene. I’ve ceded control to a machine, and it feels odd to my core. We drive along for several minutes, the car modulating its speed and steering to stay in lane and keep its distance from cars manoeuvring around it. Suddenly, the i7 encounters a cardboard box in the lane ahead, unnoticed by me. The car comes to a halt safely and I’m alerted by warning lights and sounds. It works correctly, but I’m left with many doubts about how well this will work on real roads used by vehicles with many different degrees of assistance.

Its first car to launch is this: the 3 SUV. The 3 is . We first saw the brand at the 2023 IAA Mobility show in Munich, with a larger 5 and 7 on the way. All are SUVs, with the smaller two launching with battery-electric powertrains and the largest 7 benefitting from a plug-in hybrid power mix. Anyway, the new 3 will be the smallest car launched by the brand (thus far). It’s a small and relatively anonymous-looking thing that’s targeting the likes of the and , and even fellow Chinese newcomers . Just one powertrain variant is available for the Seres 3: a 54kWh battery pack and a single 161bhp e-motor. Performance is reasonable, with a sub-nine-second 0-62mph sprint claimed, but range is relatively piddly; Seres says the 3 is only capable of 205 miles under the WLTP test procedure. For reference, a Mokka Electric claims around 252-miles of e-range, while the electric version of the Omoda 5 claims 280 miles. Every Seres 3 model features keyless start, a reversing camera, air-con and a 10.25-inch infotainment system as part of its basic Active spec. Upper Spirit trim adds a panoramic glass roof, a wireless phone charger and heated front seats. In the UK, Seres cars will be sold through the IA Electric Vehicles distrubutor. Up to now, the brand has been a UK hub for DFSK electric commercial vehicles, and lists the Skywell brand as another one of its clients – another Chinese car brand that’s also coming to the UK later in 2024. Seres and IA says that the 3 SUV will go on sale from £29,995 for base Active trim, claiming that it’s ‘the only electric SUV on the market under £30,000.’ Upper Spirit models will start from £31,995.

684,DS officially integrates ChatGPT after trial: AI-driven voice assistant tested in the UK,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/ds-chatgpt/,Jake Groves,2024-02-21,Car Magazine UK,"DS Automobiles is one of the first car makers to introduce ChatGPT into its infotainment system, after a what it considers a ‘successful trial’ in 2023. The generative AI service will be incorporated into its ‘Iris’ voice assistant, as part of its connected infotainment system. The brand says its inclusion is ‘a revolution in the automotive world,’ and boasts that it’s the first time the tech has been used in a car in Europe. Since the trial launched in the last few months of 2023, more car makers including Mercedes, Volkswagen and most recently fellow Stellantis stablemate Peugeot has said its latest infotainment systems will include ChatGPT integration. ‘Our mission at DS is to provide our customers with a unique onboard experience. As pioneers in the integration of ChatGPT into the automotive world, we are making a generative artificial intelligence that is fluid, intuitive and immersive accessible, transforming every trip into a unique journey,’ says CEO of DS Automobiles, Olivier François. We’ve been given a chance to test the technology for ourselves in the heart of London – keep reading for everything we’ve learned. ChatGPT is an AI-powered language model that’s been hitting the headlines for the last year or so. The tool, which has been developed by OpenAI, operates in a conversational way and responds to questions or prompts by users. OpenAI says that the model is capable of ‘answering follow-up questions, admitting its mistakes, challenging incorrect premises and rejecting inappropriate requests.’ The tool learns from the interactions it makes with people, too. Its use is being explored in all corners of the world. Some see it as a simple chat companion, while others are exploring its use as a productivity tool. The use of AI in general has hit the headlines as it integrates (or intrudes, some may argue) into daily life, with debates and actions arising to curb its influence. ChatGPT is seemingly one of the AI tools at the centre of these debates, as it does have limitations. For example, while it has access to vast wells of knowledge and data, it can sometimes fabricate responses or lack common sense to add context; prompts that you provide it need to be specific to get the desired result and it naturally doesn’t have much in the way of emotional intelligence. That said, there are still many that see the AI tool as a benefit designed to enhance or augment itself into a system that already exists – that’s exactly what DS is doing with its Iris in-car voice assistant. DS sees its in-car integration as one of the bespoke experiences and differences it has over others in the premium car market. After the brand trialled the technology for 20,000 DS owners, the technology will be included as standard from March 2024. Given it works in the most up-to-date version of DS’ infotainment, the technology will also likely be included via a future, imminent over-the-air update. The technology can be installed in all of DS’ models currently on sale that have the DS Connected Navigation system enabled, and up to certain points for models already on the road: The assistant needs a permanent cellular connection (which will already be active in your car, given the requirement to have the Connected Navigation system), and the ChatGPT technology installed in the DS cars for the pilot phase has a knowledge base with a cut-off point of September 2021. That means, if you were to ask it anything more recent, it would likely tell you that it doesn’t know, or even make up a response that isn’t true. ‘The plan will be to review everything after the pilot phase, and then we decide how we want to develop the technology from that point,’ says Stellantis’ UK fleet and business manager, Richard Watson. ‘But we need and want the insight first as to its usage and how everyone interacts with it before we make any final decisions with it.’ The aim for the tech is to expand the capabilities of the Iris voice assistant system. ‘Iris is the system that’s already in the car,’ says Watson, ‘but the speech recognition will move forward now to become more of a travel companion – taking it to the next level. ‘To now, assistants have very much been in-car focused: “make a phone call”, “change the radio station”, “set a navigation point.” It’s about expanding it now so it can do so much more. Some people think that might mean adding a level of complexity to our customers, but we feel it’s quite the opposite because it’s so intuitive.’ The idea is that, as well as all of those usual commands voice assistants are usually capable of, you can ask it things about what you see or give it instructions. The examples we were shown ahead of testing the technology included a driver visiting a new place and asking about what it’s famous for and information about its history. Another example was asking the service to tell a short story to distract bored kids in the back of the car. It works just like any real voice assistant does. You can ‘wake up’ the assistant by saying ‘OK Iris’, or simply pressing the voice command button on the steering wheel. We tried several commands and requests as we tested the technology in a DS 7 in East London. Landmarks like the Olympic Park in Stratford, the Traffic Light Tree near Blackwall and Reliance Square in Shoreditch gave us opportunities to ask about London’s history. After taking a wrong turn, we even asked it to tell a story about a man getting lost in London – which it did in a very corny, happily-ever-after sort of way. A couple of curious, if loose requests (“tell me about the Limehouse Link tunnel”) produced the navigation results rather than information, so you will need to get your wording right. But other than that, the system still worked like a traditional voice assistant, allowing you to make changes to your route or give someone a call while you’re driving. Our experiences were relatively smooth. We did have to correct it once or twice as it had supplied obviously wrong information, and it takes a little time to get your wording right to get the answer you’re after. But, mostly, the technology fundamentally works – and DS is keen to remind us that it will forever be learning from its inputs, meaning it’ll refine itself over time. But does its inclusion into a car completely revolutionise in-car voice assistants? No. As Watson says, if you treat it like a travel companion that you can ask it questions or get it to briefly distract the kids with games and it’s a nice little bonus. But that’s all it really feels like: a nice little bonus. And, for those who don’t really use voice assistants that much in the first place, we doubt it’ll hugely convince you to start using one more.

Set to be revealed alongside the new in Geneva, MG will launch IM Motors as its upmarket arm in Europe in 2025 as it looks to continue its dominance. IM stands for ‘Intelligent Mobility’ and was founded by MG’s parent Chinese company SAIC in 2020, alongside e-commerce giant Alibaba and R&D specialists Zhangjiang Hi-Tech. The IM L7 (pictured in the main image) was launched in 2021 as its first production car – a large electric saloon to rival the . In 2023 its Chinese range expanded to include the LS7 mid-size SUV and LS6 coupe-SUV. IM focuses purely on electric models too. Next up in the pipeline is the new IM L6, which will make its global debut at the Geneva Motor Show on 26 February 2024, alongside the new MG3 Hybrid supermini to show the two bookends of this firm. It will slot beneath the L7 and rival the and . There will be the option of a typical lithium-ion battery, as well as a new . The latter promises a ‘projected range’ of 800km (497 miles), while the L6 will offer Tesla Model 3 Performance-rivalling pace with a 0-62mph time of ‘under three seconds’. IM looks to launch in Europe in 2025. Though yet to be confirmed, a UK launch is expected slightly later in-line with the usual delay that comes with converting cars to right-hand-drive. MG’s upmarket arm says it will ‘operate in the premium sector with a clear focus on executive saloons and SUVs’. It will join a growing number of Chinese car firms looking to exert their dominance in Europe. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
686,Wild Zagato La Squadra AGTZ Twin Tail has a detachable arse,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/zagato/agtz-twin-tail/,Jake Groves,2024-02-22,Car Magazine UK,"Grand design house Zagato has paired up with Poland-based art gallery/car dealer/restaurant/magazine maker mash-up La Squadra to commission an exclusive project: the AGTZ Twin Tail. The Twin Tail is based off a current-shape Alpine A110 and is designed to honour the slightly leftfield Alpine A220 Le Mans car. While the A220 never really achieved ultimate glory, Zagato and La Squadra have appreciated how interesting the car itself was – and how the car had both a longtail and short tail model across its existence (and transfiguration from Le Mans towards other sports). The AGTZ Twin Tail is designed to echo that. As well as featuring bespoke, coachbuilt bodywork that has been sculpted to look (slightly) like the A220, the car removes a lot of the pain involved with sawing the backside off your sports car. The longtail rear and panels can be removed and reconnected at will, with the idea meaning you get two cars in one. ‘We didn’t want to make a pure racing car because technology, aerodynamics and power have changed a lot since the 1960s,’ says CEO of Zagato, Andrea Zagato; ‘Instead, we wanted to capture the inspiration and design innovation of the A220 shorttail and create an authentic Gran Turismo in the true Zagato tradition.’ Performance specs aren’t really mentioned, with Zagato and La Squadra calling the car little more than ‘a piece of art.’ And, naturally, each one of the 19 examples being crafted come with a hefty price tag: €650,000 before taxes (or around £556k at the time of writing). That point is further proven by the fact that the car’s already tipped to be shown in public in locations like The I.C.E. (the International Concours of Elegance) in St. Mortiz as well as the annual Concorso d’Eleganza at Villa d’Este in May 2024.

687,New Ineos Fusilier 4x4: electric and range-extender SUV revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/_ineos/fusilier/,Colin Overland,2024-02-23,Car Magazine UK,"Busy week for Sir Jim Ratcliffe. On Monday the petrochemicals billionaire buys a big chunk of Manchester United, the football team he’s supported since he was a boy. On Friday he returns to the pub in London’s swanky Belgravia where he conceived the plan for Ineos Automotive that’s already given us the and the to announce two electrified stablemates. Both called Fusilier, one is a full-electric off-roader, the other a range-extender version. Like the Grenadier, they were developed in partnership with Austrian firm Magna, which creates the G-Class with Mercedes. Unlike the Grenadier, which is built at a former Mercedes factory in Hambach, France, the Fusilier will be built by Magna in Graz, Austria. Ineos chairman Sir Jim says: ‘The two powertrain options provide a real-world reduction in carbon emissions without compromise to the off-road capability or the on-road performance. We’re excited to bring our electric 4×4 to market but we are beginning to understand the clear limitations of battery-electric in certain situations. We believe the addition of a range-extender electric to our line-up will offer our customers a very low-emission drive without the range anxiety drivers of electric vehicles experience today.’ Expect it to be available in 2026 or possibly 2027 in some markets, including the UK. It will be heavier than the Grenadier, as well as lower and shorter. It’s shown here in colours not yet confirmed for the production car. No price has been confirmed, but it’s likely to be more than the Grenaider. The range extender has a battery around 70% the size of the BEV’s, and may cost less. Ineos is lobbying the British government to have the range extender categorised as an EV, rather than a hybrid; as things stand, it will be banned in 2035. Design chief Toby Ecuyer – the man behind the look of the Grenadier – says of the Fusilier: ‘Ineos Automotive’s core values have informed the design from the beginning: practical, no nonsense and solid off-road performance. The Fusilier stands with an assured posture and meaningful attitude – aerodynamically tuned to maximise efficiency without compromising its purpose. Softer lines, a curved, raked windscreen and underbody profiling, it is defiant of the homogenous norm, but stands approachable, adventurous and understood.’ Most of the changes from the Grenadier are in search of slicker aerodynamics, to aid battery range. Corners are smoothed off, the grille has active shutters, the glazing is more flush, as are the wheelarches and skid plates. Whereas the Grenadier has a ladder-frame chassis, the Fusilier uses a bespoke skateboard arrangement: a flat chassis with the battery built in, and a steel and aluminium body on top. The range extender involves a ‘small’ petrol engine; more details are expected later this year. The battery cells will be from Korea. For now Ratcliffe (above) says this: ‘As we developed this vehicle, we quickly concluded that in order to move towards decarbonisation but continue making cars that consumers want to drive, we need a mix of powertrain technologies. BEVs are perfect for certain uses: shorter trips and urban deliveries, but industry and governments need to have realistic expectations around other technologies that can help accelerate the necessary pace of change. That is the reason we are offering an additional powertrain for the Fusilier, one that dramatically reduces emissions but has the range and refuelling capabilities needed.’ And what of the hydrogen-fuelled electric Grenadier shown in prototype form last year? Still ready for production, says Ineos, but only if and when the infrastructure is in place to make it viable. Ineos is looking into locally producing some cars in China and the US, and will later this decade add a fourth model – unconfirmed, but likely to be a bigger, plusher, footballer-friendly Grenadier.

688,Hyundai’s petrol hot hatches are no more in Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/hyundai/n-performance-goes-ev-only/,Ted Welford,2024-02-23,Car Magazine UK,"Hyundai has axed its and hot hatches in Europe as the firm’s performance arm switches its focus to . The South Korean firm’s RS-equivalent quickly earned itself a fearsome reputation in the hot hatch world with the introduction of the i30 N in 2017, and is now looking to do the same with performance EVs with the soon-to-launch . In a nutshell, because it wants to establish N as a successful electric performance car maker – something no other mainstream firm has achieved yet. Even though Hyundai’s upcoming Ioniq 5 N has already had rave reviews, performance EVs remain a tough sell next to their petrol counterparts. In a statement sent to , Hyundai said production of ICE N models had ‘ceased for the European market starting from February [2024] in line with our commitment to offering a zero-tailpipe-emissions line-up to our customers by 2035.’ The official statement continued: ‘Going forward in Europe, Hyundai is developing Hyundai N as a pioneer of high-performance EVs. Our customers will benefit from technological developments that will make EVs even more attractive in the future.’ Hyundai has made its confirmation clear that it only relates to the European market, and that petrol N models will continue elsewhere in the world. Cars such as the Elantra N will still be on sales lists in the USA, while it’s expected that the i20 N and i30 N will remain on sale in countries such as Australia, one of the most successful markets for Hyundai N. If you’re a fan of affordable hot hatches, it’s not been a great few years. production ended in 2023, and the little is also no more. Remember there won’t be a manual gearbox in the , either. And now there’s this news about the i20 N and i30 N too! It’s worth remembering that the and still exist if you want your petrol-powered hot hatch thrills. For now, anyway. We shouldn’t be too upset about the demise of European petrol N models, because there’s a lot to be excited about with the new Ioniq 5 N. As Hyundai has shown with its i20 N and i30 N, this firm knows how to set up a brilliant performance car, and the 641bhp Ioniq 5 N means business. We called it the ‘first proper EV performance car’ when we drove it for the first time over in South Korea at the end of 2023, and it’s one of the most eagerly anticipated new releases for 2024 in the office. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is already on sale, priced from £65,000. Senior staff writer, car reviewer, news hound, avid car detailer."
689,Renault’s gone mad at Geneva 2024: it’s built a half-track and a jet ski,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/renault/geneva-2024-concepts/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-02-26,Car Magazine UK,"Renault has given its engineers some artistic freedom – and they’ve seized the opportunity and ran with it. They’ve produced a barmy range of electrified concept vehicles for the , none of which have anything to do with cars. There are five wacky vehicles in total, each of which was designed in tandem with some similarly zany French start-up companies. There’s an overarching theme for the consortium, too. Each one tackles a different natural element – earth, water, air and snow. Plus, all five were designed to be as compact and as fast as possible. The maddest concept is the one in the header image. It’s called the Moonbike – and it’s the world’s first pure-electric, half-track snow scooter. It weighs 90kg (which Renault says makes it properly chuckable) and it has a top speed of 25mph. It also has a big enough battery to tear around the wilderness for up to three hours. Renault also commissioned the world’s first electric jet ski, which sounds like a recipe for electrification to us. Renault obviously trusts its engineers, though, because it used French Grand Prix motorcycle rider Fabio Quartararo as the test pilot – and he’s still here. It weighs just 65kg and has a top speed of 48mph. Renault’s other weird concepts include a folding sailing dinghy called the Reverso, an electrically assisted BMX and a battery-powered hydrofoil – all of which are finished in the same fetching shade of yellow as the .

690,Renault's Scenic is Car of the Year 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/car-of-the-year-2024/,Phil McNamara,2024-02-26,Car Magazine UK,"The Renault Scenic is Car of the Year 2024, with the winner revealed at a Geneva motor show ceremony today (Monday 26 February). The BMW 5-series took second place, and the Peugeot 3008 took the final step on the podium. The best car launched the previous year is voted for by a jury of 59 motoring journalists from 22 countries around Europe, including CAR’s Phil McNamara. Each juror has 25 points to distribute between five to seven cars on the shortlist, and can give a maximum of 10 to any one car. Accepting the award, Renault’s engineering boss Gilles le Borgne said: ‘This award is a symbol for Renault: we are back in the game. In 2020 we were deep in the red, a few days ago we gave the best financials ever for Renault group. And there is more to come!’ This year’s voting led to this points table: Car of the Year – which will celebrate its 60th winner in 2025 – is one of the most democratic awards in motoring, democratically decided and free from any commercial sponsorship. Each juror has to publish the reasoning behind their verdicts, available at the . The seven car shortlist was announced back in November, and here’s how we reported it. The Car of the Year 2024 shortlist is out – and BYD is the first Chinese car maker to be nominated for Europe’s top motoring award. BYD has launched three cars in the UK market in 2023 alone, the Atto 3 midsize SUV, Dolphin hatchback and Seal saloon. And it’s the latter, Tesla Model 3 rival that’s got the nod from the jury of 61 motoring journalists from 23 European countries. As usual, the jury – including Car’s Phil McNamara – has voted for their seven favourite cars from 28 eligible all-new models launched in 2023, amalgamated into this shortlist: • BMW i5/5-series • BYD Seal • Kia EV9 • Peugeot E-3008/3008 • Renault Scenic • Toyota C-HR • Volvo EX30 The shortlist contains four strictly EVs, two models – the BMW and Peugeot – available with both pure electric and combustion models, and the strictly hybrid Toyota C-HR. It’s been around since 1972 and this G60 version is the eighth-incarnation of the 5-series. BMW has never won Car of the Year (its most recent second place with with the i3 in 2013). ‘This is a hugely accomplished EV,’ wrote Car’s Tom Wiltshire having tested the base . Could the new big exec break its duck? BYD is the world’s second-biggest electric car maker after Tesla and the has impressed with its interior quality and high-performance AWD version, which has a 3.8s on the back to showcase its 0-62mph acceleration sprint. ‘Dynamically, it’s impressive, with incisive steering and sharp handling and a firm suspension set-up,’ wrote Keith Adams for Car. Will BYD’s dream of winning COTY24 come true? The EV9 is a rare six/seven seat EV that isn’t van based. It’s based on Kia’s eGMP platform and is a big beast promising luxurious electric people moving. ‘As a solution to families wanting to decarbonise their large car, the EV9 does an excellent job,’ reckoned Piers Ward in Car’s . Kia’s EV6 won – can its big brother repeat the trick? The 3008 needs little introduction: Peugeot sold 1.32 million of the second-generation SUV. Its replacement is launching as a pure electric version, which rolls on an all-new Stellantis architecture. Car’s Phil McNamara loved the E-3008’s cushy refined ride – read to find out if Peugeot has delivered another impressive all-rounder. Another reboot of a big French seller, the Scenic has morphed from MPV to pure electric SUV. ‘It’s spacious and – true to the Scenic philosophy – looks after the safety and well-being of those onboard. Plus it’s relatively lightweight,’ says Phil McNamara published today. The second generation of Toyota’s compact crossover now comes with a 2.0-litre hybrid, for more performance than the 1.8 hybrid. Another development will be a plug-in hybrid in 2024. ‘The new C-HR is solid, stands out, is capable of over 50mpg in the real world with ease, and is a refined drive that’s easy to live with,’ reckons Car’s . The pure electric, baby Volvo EX30 has wowed with its £34k price – partly enabled by being built in China on a Geely group platform and built in China. Indeed its sister model, the Smart #1, was also on the shortlist but edged out by the Swede. ‘It’d be very difficult to recommend a Corsa Electric or a high-spec Fiat 500e when for the same price you could have an EX30. Some rivals are better to drive – notably the even cheaper MG4 – but provided you get on with its all-touchscreen interior there are a lot of reasons to choose the Volvo,’ wrote Tom Wiltshire in his .

Replacing the ageing petrol version of this which has been one of the UK’s cheapest new cars, this new MG 3 is available purely as a hybrid that promises a longer electric range than other vehicles of this breed and still a strong focus on value for money. It’s one of only a handful of major reveals at this year’s Geneva event, including the new and . This new MG 3 is the first ‘self-charging’ hybrid to come from MG, and will rival the and . While MG says it has a focus on efficiency, it’s putting a lot of emphasis on its performance attributes. Combining a 100bhp 1.5-litre petrol engine with a 134bhp electric motor – the same size as the standard – it produces 191bhp, equating to a 0-62mph time of 8.0 seconds. It also packs a 1.83kWh battery, larger than that fitted to its rivals, which promises an ‘extensive electric-only’ range. MG claims 64mpg and 100g/km CO2 emissions. Not bad at all. The MG 3 was teased on several occasions on the run up to its reveal, and almost from the start it was clear this supermini was never going to be a looker. That’s maybe a touch harsh, but it’s a fairly generic and uninspiring design. The shark-like front grille doesn’t do it many favours, either. One thing you can guarantee with any new MG is that all the toys will be included as standard, and the new MG 3 hybrid looks to be no different. There will be two versions in the UK – SE and Trophy – with standard equipment on the base SE trim level including a 10.25-inch touchscreen with integrated Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and satellite navigation, along with a 7.0-inch digital dial display, a parking camera and range of driver assistance tech. The Trophy brings keyless entry, heated front seats and a 360-degree camera. Not bad for what is MG’s entry-level car. We’ll have to wait a few more months and closer to the MG 3’s launch, but it is expected to move away from its current budget positioning. Priced from £14,320, the outgoing MG 3 is among one of the cheapest new cars available. Of course, hybrid powertrains don’t come cheap, so expect the new MG 3 to come in at around £20,000, likely still undercutting the hybrid supermini benchmark, the Toyota Yaris, which starts from £22,630.

692,New Jeep Avenger 4xe brings off-roading ability to baby crossover,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/jeep/avenger/,Luke Wilkinson,2024-02-26,Car Magazine UK,"has finally confirmed the introduction of a four-wheel-drive , which has been promised since the initial reveal of this electric crossover. But rather than creating an electric four-wheel-drive model in what would have been a first for Jeep, it is instead relying on the recently introduced version to create this 4×4. Unlike Jeep’s other 4xe-badged models – the and the – the Avenger won’t be a , but rather a mild-hybrid setup instead. It’s essentially an extension of the e-Hybrid version already on sale, using a 134bhp 1.2-litre petrol engine widely found in the Stellantis group, but paired with two small electric motors producing 29bhp each. There’s one on either axle, and is capable of sending torque to the rear wheels, allowing four-wheel-drive. Despite the mild-hybrid’s small battery, Jeep says its ‘power looping’ technology can guarantee all-wheel-drive regardless of the level of battery charge. While we’re sceptical of the level of off-roading prowess that this relatively small mild-hybrid setup can achieve, the firm promises a ‘confident driving experience across the most challenging diverse terrains’. This 4xe model is expected to go on sale before the end of 2024. This 4xe model will sit alongside a 99bhp 1.2-litre mild ‘e-Hybrid’ model that’s already on sale. In terms of electric driving ability, Jeep says the e-Hybrid potter around town for 0.6 miles at speeds of up to 18mph before draining its battery. That doesn’t sound like much, but it’s just enough to trim the car’s CO2 emissions down to 111g/km of CO2, which is 10g/km lower than the pure petrol model. Jeep also claims the powertrain can return up to 55.3mpg. Jeep teased the 4xe with the Avenger 4×4 Concept at the 2022 Paris Motor Show. At the time, the company’s former CEO, Christian Meunier said: ‘We couldn’t help but wonder, what would happen if we injected the Jeep brand’s four-wheel-drive electrified capabilities into a compact package, while retaining the brand’s unique design language, capability and personality?’ Jeep only showed the tough visuals, keeping the finer details of the 4xe powertrain under wraps. The 4×4 concept featured chunkier tyres, prominent tow hooks, extra lights and thicker body cladding. It also previewed a new roof rack system, with belts designed to compress luggage. The 4×4 concept’s approach angle means it can cope with a 21-degree ramp and depart a 34-degree obstacle without snagging the overhangs. That’s an improvement on the regular Avenger’s capability, as well as taking ground clearance above 200mm. Jeep says the 4xe will delivers the brand’s trademark off-road prowess – and insiders say that even if the front wheels have zero grip on a 20-degree incline, the electric-powered rear axle will be able to comfortably accelerate up the car up and out of trouble. The pure-petrol Avenger features the same 99bhp 1.2-litre petrol engine as the mild hybrid model, minus the automatic gearbox and electrical gubbins. In its place – driving enthusiasts rejoice – is a six-speed manual transmission. You don’t sacrifice too much fuel economy by ditching the hybrid system, either. Jeep claims the petrol Avenger can return up to 51mpg. The first cars hit UK roads before the end of 2023, but were only be available in limited numbers – at least initially. At first, Jeep said it would bring just 500 cars to the UK in 2023, though it’s likely to introduce far more throughout in 2024 amid weakening EV sales. Prices for the petrol version start from £23,600. The Avenger was designed to be a pure- that could get more young people – especially females – to embrace a brand traditionally associated with macho outdoor types. It was also the company’s the first-ever electric vehicle. It’ll be followed by plenty more: Jeep will have four electric cars on sale in Europe by 2025 and will be all-electric in Europe by 2030. It shares some underpinnings with Stellantis stablemates such as the Peugeot 2008, but the e-CMP2 platform has been heavily modified, and the bodywork and cabin are entirely new. An Alfa Romeo spin-off, called the Milano, will follow in 2024 and be built at the same factory in Tychy, Poland, where the Fiat 500 is also produced. Jeep’s Head of Global Design Ralph Gilles said: ‘When I first started here, 31 years ago, we only had three name plates. A niche brand, not thinking in a global way. At Stellantis, the pace of change is incredible. Jeep still has a small-town dynamic, with this incredible company behind us.’ His brief from Meunier? ‘I want a fun, boxy Jeep that’s all electric.’ In turn, Gilles briefed Daniele Calonaci, European design chief: ‘Even without a badge, you need to know it’s a Jeep.’ The Avenger was designed in Italy, making the first Jeep to be designed outside the US (although studios from around the world have had design input in the past). And it doesn’t just look like a Jeep – even the EV has the brand’s traditional off-road ability too, despite being front-wheel drive. It comes with hill descent control and six driving modes: Eco, Normal, Sport, Sand, Mud and Snow. The ground clearance is 200mm or more, depending on spec, with a 20-degree breakover angle, 20-degree approach angle and a 32-degree departure angle. Most Avengers won’t ever see the dirt, but that capability and ruggedness will make them well suited to battling kerbs, speed bumps and tricky multi-storey ramps. Jeep’s former CEO Christian Meunier says the Avenger is true to the company’s core pillars of freedom, adventure, authenticity and passion. ‘It’s not marketing bullshit. Whenever we have a conversation about product, it has to be robust, and we like to convey that with the design of the product. There’s no fake stuff on a Jeep.’ Meunier also acknowledges that Jeep is under-performing in much of Europe. Italy is its biggest market by some way, with 10 per cent SUV market share, compared to one or two per cent in most other countries. ‘It’s disappointing. Why are we so low? There have been issues with offering the wrong powertrains [lacking diesels when they were in demand, then being slow with hybrids]. With the Renegade 4xe we are starting to get momentum. The vehicles are getting more appropriate for Europe, for daily use and a lifestyle machine for the weekend.’ Jeep has certainly paid more than a passing tribute to its heritage with the Avenger. Its shoulder line is from the firm’s cornerstone product, the Willy’s Jeep of 1941, as are the trapezoidal wheel arches. The floating C-pillar is from the and Grand Cherokee. The grille has the family’s seven-slot look but is in fact closed on the electric models (with cooling air coming in under the front bumper). Inside, there’s a strong horizontal line across the dashboard and plenty of oddment stowage, including a simply massive storage bin in the centre console. In the middle of the dash is a 10.25-inch infotainment screen and, in front of the driver, digital gauge cluster of 7.0 or 10.25 inches, depending on spec. The touchscreen supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, which is good because Jeep’s built-in sat-nav system costs extra. There’s a choice of seven body colours, and a variety of dealer-fit body graphics for the roof, bonnet and grille. Wheel sizes range from 16 to 18 inches. It features a single electric motor, with an output of 154bhp and 192lb ft of torque, powering the front wheels. The battery measure 51kWh and is divided into two cell banks that sit under the front and rear seats, to allow some extra room for the rear passengers’ feet. Jeep says that, under WLTP conditions, the Avenger has a maximum range of 248 miles on mixed roads or 342 miles if you’re just dithering around town. It also offers support for 100kW DC rapid charging which can charge the battery from 20 to 80 percent in 24 minutes. It measures 4084mm long and, with its short front and rear overhangs, the Avenger is the smallest Jeep, slotting into the range under the Renegade. Its boot space is 380 litres and it weighs 1541kg, of which 340kg is the electric powertrain. Globally, Jeep has enjoyed a four-fold sales increase since the start of the decade – up from 400,000 cars a year then to 1.2-1.5 million now. The success of the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee hybrids in the US shows Jeep that buyers are happy with electrification – and Jeep is so confident that it’s bring the Grand Cherokee to the UK in 2024, after delays caused by supply chain issues. A spokesperson for the brand said: ‘It’s a big opportunity. A 4xe Jeep is a better Jeep.’ Jeep’s new-look line-up will also include a Range Rover Sport rival based on the recently revealed concept, as well as a rugged Wrangler-style EV called the Recon.

693,McLaren’s Artura Spider introduces improvements to hybrid supercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mclaren/artura-spider/,Jake Groves,2024-02-27,Car Magazine UK,"McLaren has revealed its Artura Spider – its first hybrid drop-top ever. But, the brand is keen to point out, this isn’t just an Artura supercar that’s been given a retractable roof; the Artura Spider also brings along a raft of improvements that also then span across to the Artura coupe. Naturally, because it’s McLaren, the Artura Spider’s range of improvements include everything from the infinitesimal to the interesting. The Spider (as well as the revised Artura coupe) are available to order now. A few things. As always, McLaren’s Carbon Lightweight Architecture (which is basically a carbonfibre tub acting as the core of the car) is engineered in such a way that ensures no additional structural work is needed for the Spider. That reduces the amount of total weight added between the coupe and the Spider (the drop-top Artura is only 62kg heavier than the coupe) to keep the Artura’s handling sharp. The roof mechanism itself takes 11 seconds to raise or lower and can be specified with electrochromic glass (which allows the glass to tint itself in harsh sunlight) which will also automatically dim when the car is locked. ‘We’ve also chosen to put the roof controls on the upper windscreen surround out of the way,’ says the Artura Spider’s chief engineer, Andy Beale; ‘we didn’t want to mess up the Artura’s minimalistic interior or create any packaging issues.’ On top of that, though, the Artura Spider’s windscreen also includes some aerodynamic of its own. Instead of having a wind deflector attached to the top of the windscreen, there are small gurney flaps incorporated into the top edge of the windscreen frame to deflect air away from the cabin. There are even glazed rear roof buttresses to help visibility. The Spider, as well as the ‘MY25’ Artura, includes a power boost of 20bhp over the original, with max power now being rated at 690bhp and 531lb ft. All of that shove still comes from the brand’s new 3.0-litre V6 hybrid powertrain, with Beale telling us that ‘the extra 20 horsepower is in the second half of the rev range, and builds a crescendo up to 8500rpm.’ The powertrain itself benefits from new mounts, and the Artura’s eight-speed transmission includes revised calibrations and includes a new pre-fill feature that allows for 25 per cent faster shifts. That translates into a 0-62mph sprint over with in three seconds, and 0-186mph possible in 21.6 seconds. The Artura’s top speed is rated to 205mph. The most interesting part? The fact that existing Artura owners can benefit from the 20bhp power boost if they like. Yup. Naturally, given the Artura is relatively new, you’d be a bit miffed reading that there’s a tweaked version due out so soon, wouldn’t you? So, McLaren will invite existing owners to dealers that will turn up the wick on their engines via a software remap, matching the ‘MY25’ Artura and Artura Spider. For free. ‘The only time I’ve been aware of something like that was McLaren doing it previously with the 12C,’ says Beale. ‘All it is is a change in the combustion strategy within the IC engine. It’s not something that will be available over the air, but will just mean a dealer plugging in and we turn the car up.’ How does a launch control mode that allows some wheelspin sound? McLaren’s new ‘Spinning Wheel Pull-Away’ mode (catchy, huh?) allows the car to do exactly that, if you like, when using the launch control function. As well as new colours and ‘stealth’ detailing, additional safety kit has been added including blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. But fear not, McLaren’s not keen on your car nagging you: ‘the lane departure warning has its own button on the dashboard – you don’t have to go through a menu to get to it – and it remembers your preference the next time you drive,’ says Beale. Phew. A new wireless phone charger is included in the centre console, too. But, unlike most wireless pads that are horizontal, McLaren has designed one that hugs your phone as it stands vertically. Handy for those who are ‘driving enthusiastically,’ according to Beale. McLaren says the new Artura Spider, as well as the refreshed coupe, are available to order now with the first models arriving in ‘mid-2024.’ Want one?

694,Arcadia: Rolls-Royce’s latest one-off Droptail is magnificent,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rolls-royce/arcadia/,Colin Overland,2024-02-29,Car Magazine UK,"If it seems odd to talk about a one-off multi-million-pound luxury car being simple, one glance at the pictures of the Rolls-Royce Arcadia should clarify matters. This is the third of four versions of the Droptail being built by the Coachbuild department at Rolls-Royce’s Goodwood HQ. We’ve previously seen the red one (‘La Rose Noire’) and the blue one (‘Amethyst’), and now here is the white one (‘Arcadia’, alluding to a utopian pastoral vision, rather than a short-lived Duran Duran side project). The fourth Droptail won’t be made public, by the way; its owner prefers to keep it private. Like the other Droptails, it’s a two-seat convertible built on a shortened aluminium, steel and carbonfibre chassis not shared with regular production Rolls-Royces. The 6.75-litre V12 engine is tuned to 593bhp and 620lb ft. But the detachable carbonfibre roof is unique to this car, as are many of the details on the elegantly plain white exterior and the cossetting wood-and-leather interior. We were among a select few who got up close to the hand-made one-off at Goodwood before it was shipped to its wealthy owner. That anonymous – and very fortunate – buyer was intimately involved with the creation of Arcadia over more than four years. Our guide is Alex Innes, head of Coachbuild. He points out that a crucial difference to the other Droptails is that the carbonfibre sections at the bottom of Arcadia’s rear bodywork are painted, whereas they’re exposed on the others. This allows more use of that lucious paint: chiefly it’s solid white, infused with aluminium and glass particles, giving a shimmering effect and the illusion of great depth. It also emphasises the car’s low, muscular stance. There are 233 pieces of wood used, 76 of them on the rear deck, and some of them bolstered by unseen carbonfibre. To preserve the wood, coatings used on superyachts were deemed inadequate, as they would need regular reapplication, and instead Rolls developed its own, which should last the lifetime of the car. The wood on the deck is not just decorative. Says Innes: ‘Aerodynamicists will tell you not to have a droptail shape, but we’ve overcome the problems by ensuring the shape of the wood guides the air appropriately.’ He’s particularly proud of the shape of the roof. ‘It’s less casual than the roof on the other Droptails, and requires a couple of people and a few minutes – a conscious choice to take it off or put it on.’ And although it’s supremely simple at a glance, the dash includes the most complex clock face Rolls-Royce has ever been involved with – assembly took five months, notes Innes. Coachbuild cars are made at Goodwood, but they don’t go down the same production line as Phantoms, Cullinans, Ghosts and Spectres. ‘We build Coachbuild cars like they build a yacht,’ says Innes; ‘the car stays in one place, we move to it.’ But for all its finery, Arcadia is a car designed to be used. Fully road legal and (virtually) crash-tested, it has pop-up crash-protection hoops behind the occupants’ heads, designed to burst through that exquistely crafted wood if the worst should happen. Muses Innes: ‘All of this complexity and effort to achieve something that looks natural…’ But he’s hugely proud of the result of his team’s collaboration with the client, in creating something timelessly elegant: ‘You can imagine in 100 years this car not being recognised as being from the 2020s.’ What next for this brilliant design? In theory, nothing. Innes insists that the nature of Coachbuild means its clients get something truly unique – so this is not to be seen as a preview of future two-seat convertible Rolls-Royces. But that said, Rolls design chief Anders Warming is a frequent visitor to the Coachbuild studio, and can’t have failed to have been wowed by Arcadia. His tape measure will doubtless have confirmed that the Spectre’s electric underpinnings could be shoe-horned in.

695,Baby Microlino and Microlino Lite EV zip into 2024 Geneva show,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/microlino/,Jake Groves,2024-02-29,Car Magazine UK,"Is this the return of the bubble car?  Two Swiss brothers are returning to the downsized delight of the BMW’s Isetta era with a tiny electric car: the Microlino. The original has been on sale in certain markets in Europe in 2023, with the Micro brand also launching a new Microlino Lite model at the 2024 Geneva motor show. The Microlino is a diminutive EV inspired by 1950s bubble cars and is designed for urban use at affordable prices. The city EV is classified as a quadricycle, rather than a car, given its size and small powertrain, meaning it can be driven by younger people in markets across Europe or, in the UK, those who just have a motorcycle licence. Originally, the Microlino launched in 2023 with two models: the Dolce (priced from €19,990) or the Competizione (€21,990). Then along came the Lite model, making its debut at the 2024 Geneva show. Just look at it! The Microlino is just 2.5 metres long, making it easy to park (the makers claim you can squeeze three into one conventional space), and weighs in at just 496kg. It’s a virtuous circle: low mass and a tiny footprint means the electric powertrain uses less energy, so smaller lithium-ion batteries are required. It’s a wonderful tonic to the spiralling weight of modern cars (especially electric ones). Buyers can choose between 6kWh, 10.5kWh and 14kWh battery capacities and the company quotes recharging times between three and four hours, depending on the size of cell. Range is calculated at 56, 110 or 143 miles. It’s a strict two-seater and the boot is 230 litres, enough for a daily shop and trips around town, according to its makers. Performance? Zero to 30mph takes around five seconds and top speed is capped at 56mph. It sounds perfectly fast enough for urban duties. ‘We realised that with 1.2 people sitting in a car on average and a distance driven of just around 35 km (22 miles), modern cars are far too big for what they are actually used for,’ said co-founder Merlin Ouboter. Hence the idea to revive tiny bubble-car-era design, with their quirky front door, for the twenty-first century. You can order a Microlino now, with reports pointing to a UK market launch due in the summer of 2024. The Lite model features a smaller battery sizes and a top speed limited to 45km/h (27mph) to comply with L6E licencing requirements that allows people to own a Lite without a driving licence. Those battery sizes – either 5.5kWh or 11 kWh – allow a range of 62 or 111 miles respectively. Spec a Lite and you’ll be able to pick from just two colours – Venice Blue or Berlin Anthracite – as well as specific ‘Lite’ graphics in orange as standard. Micro was founded in 1999 by Wim Ouboter, who launched the Kickscooter and claims to have invented the micromobility movement with 90 million scooters sold since. In 2013, it launched its first e-scooter and went on to collaborate with BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot on two-wheeled projects. The Microlino quadricycle project started in 2015 led by Ouboter’s two sons, Merlin and Oliver, and has suffered numerous setbacks along the way to production. Low-volume build started with Italian partner Cecomp in Turin in summer 2022 and is set to be ramped up in 2023. More than 35,000 people have reserved a Microlino, the company claims. ‘The idea was to create an alternative to conventional cars,’ Oliver told Reuters. ‘The Microlino does that much better than bicycles – it’s weather protected, you have space for cargo, you can have two people sitting next to each other.’ Brother Merlin added: ‘Because it’s smaller than a conventional car it consumes less material to make it, and it has a smaller battery which means it uses less electricity. So the ecological footprint is about a third of a conventional electric car.’ The Microlino was plainly inspired by the bubble cars of the 1950s. The BMW Isetta is perhaps the best remembered example. Impossibly cute, wasn’t it? Early Isettas (above) had three wheels, which helped in some territories such as the British market where there were tax benefits for a single rear wheel. Most European Isettas had two closely-spaced rear wheels. The Microlino is a four-wheeler, too – bringing greater stability and better grip when whizzing around town. Note also the unusual front-hinged door for access shared across both eras of bubble car. The Isetta had a single front door and its steering column pivoted out with it. The Microlino’s column stays static, making it more like the Heinkel and Trojan bubble cars from the late 1950s and 1960s.

696,Lamborghini Active Wheel Carrier tech explained: Sant'Agata reinvents the wheel,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/lamborghini-active-wheel-carrier/,Ben Barry,2024-03-01,Car Magazine UK,"The Nardo Handling Track in southern Italy is 3.9 miles of mostly fast or very fast turns nestled at the bottom of the Nardo Ring like a wonky arch in a goldfish bowl. For a pro driver to lap 2.8 seconds faster here in virtually the same car might require upgrades like stickier tyres, stiffer suspension and upgraded brakes. The test mule I’m driving has none of this, and even the stability control is off, but it has achieved that same improvement with the flick of a switch. It’s a huge gap. Now Lamborghini chief technical officer Rouven Mohr wants me to feel the difference before he’ll reveal the genius tech his team’s been working on ahead of a production debut on ‘future super sports cars’ (not very subtle code for ). I head out to a slalom and steering pad with ex-racer and Lamborghini tester Nicolo Piancastelli in the passenger seat, knowing only that the new system is meant to help take the existing LDVI (Lamborghini Dynamic Vehicle Integration) technology to the next level. LDVI is the electronic brain that debuted on the Huracan in 2015 and made a recent leap with ; it predictively mediates between various chassis, powertrain and steering systems. Weaving down the slalom, the standard car’s front end is incredibly reactive to steering inputs, partly because the rear is relatively unstable – you lean on what feels like a hard, bladed edge behind you, almost like ice skating. It’s agile but edgy. Building to a steady 70mph on the steering pad, I turn in, lift the throttle abruptly and the Huracan arcs first into a slide, then a tankslapper requiring multiple corrections. Yep, definitely edgy. We pull over, Piancastelli flicks a switch near the steering wheel and seconds later I’m struggling to compute what’s just happened. Through the slalom the front feels exactly the same, the suspension appears to allow just as much roll over the rear axle, but the blade-like feeling at the rear has vanished, replaced by a more cushioned sensation. ‘I can see you are immediately making more aggressive steering inputs,’ comments Piancastelli. I am. On the steering pad the system makes the Huracan much more stable, but it also pushes more into stubborn understeer, then appears to actively counter the smaller tankslapper I eventually induce by dissipating weight transfer in a way not dissimilar to stability control, if without the jolty braking. Mohr grins as I feed back, and he confirms the system is exclusively focused on the rear and that there are no new active adjustments influencing suspension control. ‘Well, any ideas?’ he asks. I suggest maybe rear-wheel steering (already fitted to other Huracans, though), perhaps a new e-differential (the old one is mechanical). ‘Hmm, maybe…’ What I’ve actually experienced is Active Wheel Carrier, or a way to actively control the camber and toe of the wheel and tyre. Initially conceived at Audi, it has been developed by Lamborghini as part of a wider plan for Sant’Agata to forge a reputation as a tech trailblazer. First, a quick refresher. Camber is how much the top of the wheels lean towards (negative) or away from (positive camber) each other when you view the car from straight ahead or behind. It’s a way to manipulate how much of the tyre’s contact patch touches the road. Adjusting toe, meanwhile, makes a car either more responsive to steering inputs or more stable – toe-in is like standing with your toes pointed a little towards each other (more stable), toe-out being the opposite (keener to steer). Normally camber and toe are set at the factory as a one-size-fits-all compromise. Under braking, cornering and acceleration loads on the car change, altering how the tyre interacts with the surface. Active Wheel Carrier aims to remove the compromise by generating the maximum mechanical grip at all times. The key is a pair of new wheel hubs sandwiched between the suspension components and each wheel. Each hub features two eccentric cylinders connected by bearing packs – I pick a hub up and twist the cylinders in opposite directions like I might a Rubik’s Cube; when you’re driving an electro-mechanical system does the job. The system can theoretically adjust by 60º in one second, and in practice allows adjustments of camber by +2.5º to -5.5º and toe by +/- 6.6º, which handily removes the need for a separate rear-wheel steering system. No word yet on weight, which they’re apparently working on, but Mohr doesn’t correct me when I say each unit seems to add about 6-7kg, and the system would be 20-25kg in total. Benefits and potential benefits are myriad. Not only does the driver get more confidence from up to 25 per cent more mechanical grip from the same tyre, but tyres wear more evenly across their tread. That means a much softer and grippier tyre compound could be used with Active Wheel Carrier effectively offsetting the higher wear rates. The system could also adapt to a wearing tyre, self-correct for alignment, and be calibrated for different modes and drivers, ranging from maximum stability to a full drift mode. Each wheel can also be individually adjusted. This is not a completely new idea – you might remember Lewis Hamilton changing camber settings on the fly in his F1 car, for instance. But Mohr emphasises that there’s another crucial aspect to Lamborghini’s implementation of the idea. To avoid the peculiar feeling of camber and toe changing, there’s predictive ‘feed-forward’ software control. This is designed to make the system more driver-orientated, with the driver ‘in the loop’, and electronics figuring out what he or she wants micro-seconds in advance, based on their inputs. To do this, LDVI also analyses the dynamic state of the car and projects that ‘into time and space’ to work out what the appropriate response would be – preparing for the weight transfer of a drifting transition, for instance. Mohr likens it to proprioception in humans, where neurons in muscles, tendons and joints feed back to the brain, helping us balance and co-ordinate movements. ‘If you want to decouple camber and toe and use it to its full potential, you need this forecast, otherwise you’d exploit only half of it, so the control strategy is the enabler,’ Mohr sums up. ‘It lets the driver achieve the limit in a way that before was not possible.’ This has taken endless hours of simulator time, because it’s only in a virtual environment that Lamborghini can cycle through multiple scenarios that can be exactly replicated time and again. Now fully briefed about the technology I’m experiencing, I head out on the Handling Circuit, which is a fearsomely fast place whatever you’re driving, never mind a V10 supercar with stability control kicked into touch. The track drive reinforces what I’d learnt earlier, but reveals more nuances. When I brake deep into a mid-speed left-hander with the system off, for instance, the rear wants to sweep round and tuck the nose into the apex – the car is alive and adjustable, but it does keep me on my toes. Even really fast flat-out corners that aren’t grip-limited feel heart-in-mouth. We pit, flick the switch and head back out. With Active Wheel Carrier engaged I have more confidence to dig deeper into the power and push hard through the real commitment stuff, but some of the immediacy and reactivity of the previous laps is lacking, and on the first tighter corner I scrub into understeer. The rear end has more grip than the front (which now pushes wide as a result) and the system has been primed for maximum stability. But the fact I lap 4.41 seconds faster using the Active Wheel Carrier system is hard proof of just how effective it is. If there’s a caveat to that, it’s that this was my first visit to Nardo, so there was inevitably a learning process during my six total laps, but the fact is the system does let less experienced drivers shave more from their lap time than adaptable pros. Crucially, this is just the beginning of a process that will introduce each element of the new LDVI system in turn, allowing the benefits to be properly analysed in isolation. The same system, for instance, could be applied to the front axle to hopefully combine a highly reactive front end with the more stable rear (and/or a wider, stickier front tyre could be fitted). A new tyre compound will also be developed to fully exploit its benefits. And new active aerodynamics will further tap the capability. That 2.8sec lap-time improvement will doubtless improve a mind-boggling amount more. Today gives us just a glimpse of how it will drive, but on this basis it’s shaping up to be quite the thing.

697,Nostokana: BMW’s animated Art car is here,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/i5-flow-art-car/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-03-01,Car Magazine UK,"► BMW’s latest Art car revealed ► i5 flow shown at Freize LA ► Moves on the tech shown at the i Vision Dee concept BMW has shown its colour-shifting E-ink several times now – most notably with – but now it’s combined its cutting-edge tech with its Art car program. Unveiled at Freize Los Angeles, the BMW i5 Flow Nostokana fuses all the creativity of South African artist Esther Mahlangu with the technology of Munich – and as you can probably guess it uses an as a canvas. ‘The BMW i5 Flow Nostokana honours the history of the BMW brand and continues the story of our global cultural engagement in a unique way. It combines art and design through progressive technology. Here, technology itself becomes art,’ said Adrian van Hooydonk, head of BMW Group Design. The new piece references another Mahlangu art car; a BMW 525i revealed back in 1991. Back then it was the first art car designed by a woman and African artist. Just like the technology we’ve seen on other concepts, the i5 uses large areas of film that change colour depending on the voltage applied. There are two strips across the roof, bonnet and rear section and one on each side. However, look closely and there’s some 1349 separate pieces in total, all working together to bring Mahlangu’s work to life. Control them all individually, and the i5 becomes a moving piece of moving art: ‘It is fascinating to me to see how modern technology can expand my art and make it accessible to a completely new audience,’ said Mahlangu. BMW’s creative director for sound Renzo Vitale crafted audio for the art and animations, using sequences from the artist’s voice – as well as the brushes she uses for painting. These noises were then added to some of the chirps and noises you get when using the i5’s touchscreen.

Although based on the new road car, as before, the new Safety Car has a few performance tweaks to make it a little better at keeping 20 F1 cars behind it. We got to see the new Vantage a few weeks ago, but this will make its debut at the Saudi Arabian GP in Jeddah. ‘It is a pleasure to drive the Aston Martin Vantage. The car comes from an incredible bloodline and this newest version is the fastest yet,’ said long time safety car driver Bernd Mayländer. ‘My first impressions were very positive as I could immediately feel the improvement in handling and, of course, power. We need a car that is fast and focused so we can respond quickly and safely when we receive the call for on-track deployment and Vantage provides that.’ The Safety Car sticks with the same 656bhp 4.0-litre twin turbo V8 as the road model, ensuring a 30% boost in power – and there’s been no changes to the cooling or braking systems either. The aerodynamics have been tweaked though: Aston Martin engineers have worked hard on underfloor aerodynamics to generate extra grip and downforce for the new safety car, and there’s also a new front splitter too. The most obvious change comes in the form of a new rear wing, to provide better stability for the rear of the car. More subtle, however, is the new-shape lightbar on the roof – designed to reduce air resistance as much as possible. Every little helps when you’ve got impatient F1 cars behind you… It’s all business inside, with the Vantage’s new interior adapted for use with the FIA’s safety systems. As you’d expect there are screens to show lap times, a live map of the cars and a rear-view camera too. Still, it’s finished in Lime Essence trim, at least.

699,"Dodge’s new, electric Charger brims with macho muscle and fake noise",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/dodge/charger/,Jake Groves,2024-03-06,Car Magazine UK,"Dodge has unveiled its production-spec, battery-electric Charger muscle car – following on from its controversial . The brand claims the new-generation to be the ‘world’s first and only electric muscle car’, brimming with confidence that going zero emission is the future of high-powered, super-macho muscle machines. That said, Dodge says it will also offer a straight-six-powered model, as well as a four-door version in 2025. So not *that* confident, obviously. Yup, although you wouldn’t really be able to tell upon first glance. It still looks like a familiar muscle car, with the Charger’s most classic design details as preserved as possible after the transition. The long front end, as always with Chargers, features a wide oblong area for the lights and badge to be housed into but, this time, doubles as a massive front spoiler that directs air flow over the car. Dodge calls it the ‘R-Wing’. Inside, it’s as cocooning as it always is inside a low-roofed muscle car. A moulded centre console and chunky dashboard design shrouds a digital instrument cluster (10.25-inches as standard, or available with a larger 16-inch option) and a 12.3-inch central screen. There’s lots to talk about, and a lot of the Charger’s clever stuff is dripping with names that have a whiff of fragile masculinity. SIXPACK! POWERSHOT! ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT! And so on… Fundamentally, the new electric Charger is the first car to use the STLA Large platform, an ‘EV-native’ architecture . Other cars to use the platform include the new , as well as in 2026. For the Charger, the platform runs a 400-volt architecture (STLA Large can also run 800-volt), features a 100.5kWh battery pack and an electric motor on each axle for all-electric all-wheel drive. Two models of electric Charger have been announced: R/T and Scat Pack. The R/T model benefits from 496bhp, while the Scat Pack model churns out 670bhp – enough for a 3.3sec 0-60mph sprint. Both electric Charger models feature an e-boost function called ‘PowerShot’, which adds 40bhp of extra shove for 15 seconds, and more Charger variants will come in time. And, as predicted from the concept car, the production model features the new ‘Fratzonic exhaust’, which claims to deliver ‘Hellcat levels of sound intensity.’ Essentially, it’ll rev like a traditional muscle car – albeit with a slightly digital undertone. On top of that, Dodge is offering a range of performance options to further enhance your muscle car. The Track Package (available for the Scat Pack) upgrades the standard brakes to six-piston front/four-piston rear Brembo ones from the previous-generation SRT model, mixed-width Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3 tyres and adaptive dampers. Every Charger benefits from a selection of drive modes, as well as ‘Line Lock’ (the ability to do clean burnouts), Launch Control (fairly self-explanatory) and Race Prep (a mode that pre-conditions the battery pack for high-performance driving or drag racing. Inside, Dodge’s ‘Attitude Adjustment’ tech translates to fairly substantial ambient lighting customisation and the car has an in-built drive recorder so you can video your hot laps or drag sprints. For Scat Pack, there’s also a donut mode and drift mode included, too. And, if you don’t want an electric one, Dodge has you covered. A ‘SixPack’ twin-turbo straight-six powered combustion model (that develops 420bhp or 550bhp) will launch in 2025 – as will a four-door model.

700,New Rivian R2 electric SUV is coming to Europe,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rivian/r2/,Piers Ward,2024-03-07,Car Magazine UK,"US start-up Rivian has unveiled the R2, a mid-sized electric SUV similar in dimensions to a , that is destined for European sales in mid-2026. Priced from $45,000, the car is a significant step-up for the brand – up until now, Rivian has only offered the and , a large SUV and truck respectively, which were more suited to its home market. With the R2, the brand is hoping it will become a much bigger global player. Based around a new platform that also underpins the R3 and R3 X, the R2 is a five-seat SUV (unlike the R1S that comes with seven seats) that has three motor options from launch. Single, double and tri-motor set-ups will all be available, with the latter capable of a 0-60mph time in less than 3.0 seconds. Key rival the manages the same sprint in 4.4 seconds, giving Rivian the early bragging rights. Battery size isn’t confirmed yet, but two options will be available, with the bigger of the two offering more than 300 miles of range. The R2 uses a 4695 cylinder-shaped cell that’s more energy dense than the R1, while charging from 10-80% should be possible in under 30 minutes, about par for the course these days. Rivian’s strap line is ‘keep the world adventurous forever’, so the R2 has 250mm of ground clearance and short front and rear overhangs to give decent approach and departure angles. It gets the same door-mounted removable torch as the R1 sibling and a USB-charged hand warmer is promised as a future option in the same spot: it’s not only Rolls-Royce and Skoda that can hide useful things in doors. All the seats also fold completely flat – Glastonbury here we come – and the boot window drops down into the door frame to give easier access to the space back there. There’s also a large frunk and a fold-out platform in the boot that acts as a seat, Range Rover. The rear windows pop out sideways, like the Mercedes V-Class and plenty of others. So not exactly a new phenomenon but given the ecstatic reaction from the US audience when CEO RJ Scaringe unveiled this aspect, you’d have thought he’d solved nuclear fission. As you’d expect from an all-electric brand, sustainable materials are used throughout while Scaringe was keen to emphasise the usability of the cabin with its the twin scroll wheels on the steering wheel. Offering haptic feedback and the ability to operate in three axis (rotate, push, side-to-side), they’re promised to make the touchscreen more navigable. No word yet on UK sales but, given the global ambitions of Rivian and the popularity of this size of car in the British market, it would seem a sure bet it’ll follow soon after the European debut.

701,Rivian's electric shock: R3 and radical R3X revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/rivian/r3/,Piers Ward,2024-03-07,Car Magazine UK,"Trust the Americans to put on a show. At the same reveal event where US electric car manufacturer Rivian , CEO RJ Scaringe stunned the audience by wheeling out a further two cars: the R3 and R3 X. Cue plenty of whooping and hollering from the crowd watching the unveil in a Laguna Beach theatre. And unlike the and , and even to a certain extent the R2, the 3s are quite clearly aimed at the European market with a footprint similar to the and its . Rivian is in the process of trying to expand rapidly and the 3s will give it the global volume to realise those ambitions. A new factory is being built in Atlanta, Georgia, to give it the capacity. Technical details and dates are largely absent for the time being, which is no surprise given it won’t arrive until late 2026 at the absolute earliest. Little was confirmed at the reveal, but we do know that it’ll offer the same three options on motors – single rear, twin four-wheel drive, tri-motor with one at the front and two at the rear. If power matches the larger R2, a 0-60mph time should be in the low 3s. On-road handling is promised to back up the pace. Running on the same platform as the larger R2 but with a wheelbase that’s 135mm shorter, the R3 will have two battery options with a target of 300+ miles of range for the larger version. Charging will be via a right rear port that again points to the influence of Europe in the design – a lot of our charging will be done on street chargers and Rivian wanted to make this as neat as possible. Jeff Hammoud, head of design at Rivian, told us that he ‘doesn’t like it when a cable is strung across the car’. The R3 X (pictured below) is the intriguing one. Coming only with a tri-motor option, the wider track and tyres with increased ground clearance point to Rivian exploring more performance-orientated versions. Hammoud told us it has ‘the soul of a rally car’ and you can see the influence of cars like the Lancia Delta in its shape and stance. As with the R2, both cars get adventure-inspired tricks inside and out. The split rear hatch opens to give easier access to the boot, while the Rivian calling card of a torch in the door is also included. An outdoor kitchen is also promised. Prices aren’t confirmed but with the larger R2 starting at $45,000, it’s likely the R3 will dip under $40k. That puts it under similarly sized cars like the Volvo EX40 and BMW iX1, which should ensure it shakes things up a bit. In a sign of just how much brands like Rivian are disrupting the normal class structure, it could even compete with the upper end of the electric supermini market. Is this Rivian’s ‘moment’? On the hollering-scale, it looks like it could be. CAR magazine's deputy editor has a penchant for automotive adventure and trading in quirky, often-unreliable old cars.

702,How the UK’s cottage car industry is embracing electric,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/uk-cottage-industry-electric/,Piers Ward,2024-03-08,Car Magazine UK,"Back in 2009, I was chatting to some Formula 5000 racers who were panicking that the Chrysler 5.0-litre V8s they ran in their single-seaters might cease to be available as the manufacturer had gone into liquidation. Fortunately, the Chrysler V8 was so ubiquitous that it would need several very bad seasons to get through the millions of engines in existence. For 2009 and F5000, read 2024 and Britain’s small but vital sports car industry. The issue of supply is one that faces Morgan, Caterham and Ariel today, as they all rely on engines from manufacturers that will build fewer combustion engines as the transition to EV continues. Morgan uses Ford threes and BMW’s fours and straight sixes, while Caterham goes for Suzuki and Ford, and Ariel has a long history with Honda fours. It’s a strange situation they find themselves in. Neither customers nor legislators are pushing these companies to ditch the internal-combustion engine; the EU announced the 2035 ban won’t apply to companies that build fewer than 1000 cars a year. But their hands may be forced by their suppliers. It’s one of the reasons why , a prototype electric car based on the Super Three (although, ironically, the legislation doesn’t apply to tricycles). As Matt Hole, Morgan’s new CTO, explains: ‘This gives us a future opportunity for our powertrain changing. ‘Historically, we’ve flirted with EVs [most recently, Morgan developed the EV3 back in 2015 but it never made it into production] but have never had the technology to implement them properly. We have created an interest in the market and are indirectly pressured by legislation, but it’s mainly down to where we get our powertrains from. We will offer ICE and EV in parallel in the future.’ All of which has encouraged a new spirit of experimentation among the ‘men in sheds’ who make niche sports cars. Morgan, for instance, has realised that the R&D work necessary to build the XP1 has given it a new mastery of software that will help both the future EV and also the next versions of the Plus 4 and 6. It has meant Hole and his team can run many options through the software – where the 100kW electric motor might best fit, for instance –without going to the expense of building it. That’s handy with a car that has no confirmed build date. ‘The modelling tool allows us to visualise if we could put the motor and planetary gearbox in the ideal place [behind the roll hoops] instead of in the transmission tunnel. It also allowed us to tune the sound and the character of the motor.’ Weight is still an issue, although Hole claims the 33kWh battery means the XP1 is only around 70kg heavier than the combustion version. Similarly, Caterham is well aware that its minimalist USP could be under threat. Last summer it unveiled two electric concepts – one of them such a departure that it actually features a roof, . This has firmer production details than Morgan or Ariel as Caterham hopes the V will be on sale in 2026. It rides on a bespoke platform and, while it doesn’t look like any other Caterham, it promises the same attention to light weighting that has been the brand’s hallmark, with a target of 1190kg. This will help keep the pace on the correct side of exciting (270bhp and a 0-62mph time below 4.5 seconds) and means a competitive 249-mile range, thanks to a lack of flab rather than a big battery. Traditionally, veering away from your core hasn’t worked well for these sorts of companies. Just look at the Caterham 21. Adaptability will be key to survival. Technically the is not an electric car. It’s a hybrid, but not in the way a Prius is a hybrid. It sports a gas-turbine range-extender coupled to a 62kWh battery feeding a pair of 295bhp electric motors. The car is still in development and, like the Morgan XP1, won’t be with customers any time soon. Ariel’s MD, Henry Siebert-Saunders, told us that something will come of it eventually, but ‘whether it’s the Hipercar specifically or something else using the technology for another application’ is still up for discussion.

703,Crackdown launched on middle-lane hoggers and tailgaters,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/middle-lane-hoggers/,Ted Welford,2024-03-08,Car Magazine UK,"A new campaign is being launched to crack down on middle-lane hoggers and tailgaters, two of drivers’ biggest bugbears. National Highways, formerly known as Highways England, is now launching the campaign to urge motorists to make ‘little changes’ to help reduce  frustration on the roads and reduce journey times as a result. As if spending time on British motorways and major A roads isn’t enough to tell you that motorists love to sit in the middle lane, National Highways conducted a survey… The study of 2,500 drivers revealed that 32 per cent admitted to being middle-lane hoggers at least occasionally, while 34 per cent noticed other motorists doing it. Little bit worrying that two-thirds didn’t notice it, right? As for tailgaters, 67 per cent of drivers said that it was a ‘serious problem’ on main trunk roads, with 23 per cent of motorists admitting to driving too close to the vehicle in front at least occasionally. This campaign is being run by National Highways, which has the job of looking after England’s motorways and major A roads, but doesn’t have any enforcement powers itself. The organisation’s new campaign carries the slogan ‘little changes, changes everything’. It will air the campaign on radio and television adverts, podcasts, roadside billboards and on social media, among other places. You might have noticed an increased use of ‘keep left unless overtaking’ displayed on motorway gantries already, too. National Highways director of road safety Sheena Hague said: ‘Bad habits can make driving on our motorways a challenging experience, as those who lane hog or tailgate frustrate other drivers and make them feel unsafe. Both are dangerous and can cause accidents. ‘Our campaign aims to motivate motorists to embrace little changes, which will have an overall positive effect on both them and their fellow road users, reduce congestion and keep traffic flowing. ‘The message is simple – always allow plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front, and unless overtaking, move into the left-hand lane.’ One can hope the message gets across to more motorists – and especially if you have the misfortune of regularly driving on the M25, where there’s seemingly a magnetic field keeping motorists from using anything that isn’t the third or the fourth lane. Many drivers that currently lane-hog, in particular, may be unaware of what they’re doing, so a small reminder might indeed help. However, unless there’s more enforcement by the police of middle-lane hogging and those tailgating, little difference is likely to be made. Both offences do fall under the ‘careless driving’ umbrella, however, with police having powers to hand out on-the-spot fines of £100 and three penalty points.

704,Mercedes' drive for D&I: how the F1 team continues to work on diversity and inclusion,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/mercedes-benz/amg-f1-di-2024/,Curtis Moldrich,2024-03-08,Car Magazine UK,"Lewis Hamilton shocked the entire paddock earlier this year, when he announced a last-minute switch to Ferrari for 2025. His move will mark the end of a partnership that has provided six drivers’ championships and eight constructors titles – but it’s been equally impactful off the track. For the last few years, both Mercedes and Hamilton have been working into improve diversity and inclusion within the F1 world – and recent events show D&I is only becoming more relevant in 2024. The departure of the seven-time world champion will certainly have an impact on Mercedes on track, but one thing that won’t change post-Hamilton is the brand’s commitment to D&I. To find out where Mercedes is now and where it plans to go, we spoke to the team’s head of communications Bradley Lord. Mercedes’ key program is Accelerate 25, which aims to hire at least 25% of new starters from under-represented groups. ‘Accelerate 25 expresses the team’s determination and commitment to build a more diverse, inclusive, performant team,’ Lord tells us. ‘That continues independent to who drives for us, but Lewis has been a massively important inspiration, catalyst and driving force – in terms of pushing us and holding us to account on the progress that we’re making.’ The reasons for the number were simple; attaching a real target behind the initiative meant it would be about more than conversations and awareness – as important as they are. According to Lord, the program has already been hugely successful: ‘Accelerate 25 has helped us make big strides towards diversifying the makeup of our team,’ he tells us. “[We] recruit team members from a broader cross section of backgrounds than we ever have done before.’ Although drivers are the most obvious, visible sign of diversity it’s the engineering jobs at the factory and race track that hold the most D&I potential – after all there are only ever two race drivers. Celebrating all the women in our team on From the factory to the race track, we strive constantly to ❤ ‘We continue to focus on our goal to attract and recruit from the widest pool of high performing and diverse talent, including through a wider cross section of universities for more graduate level recruits than before. ‘[In terms of] the proportion of team members from minority ethnic groups or the number of female team members as well, we’ve seen an increase in quantity, and in overall percentage even with the overall growth of the team in the period. Accelerate 25 is all about widening the pool the team recruits from, but it’s also worked on making sure candidates from under-represented backgrounds end up studying STEM projects in the first place. That’s why the team has continued to work with schools through the Mulberry Schools Trust and Mulberry STEM Academy to ensure more students feel inspired or allowed to study STEM subjects in further education: ‘Together with our Accelerate 25 partners, we are working to inspire and motivate talented students from under-represented groups towards STEM education, both at school and in further education, and onwards to technical careers,’ Lord explains. ‘Results show that these programmes contribute to a bigger percentage of students taking up STEM subjects, and increased attainment in exams.’ In this way, Mercedes is taking more from the top of the pyramid, but also increasing the base of the pyramid at a grassroots level too. There has been one key change to Mercedes D&I plans, the consolidation of the Ignite program. A joint project between Hamilton and Mercedes, it worked on increasing the pipeline of diverse talent by igniting and inspiring enthusiasm for motorsport through STEM education. ‘Ignite was a partnership where the team and Lewis were committing equal funding and working together on joint diversity initiatives,’ Lord tells us. ‘It was decided in late 2022 that for maximum effectiveness and impact, we would fold Ignite and the projects that Ignite was currently funding, into Mission 44.’ ‘We realised we had three things: The team’s internal work, joint work and Mission 44 (Hamilton’s own D&I organisation). So it’s just an efficiency and rationalising of it rather than any lowering of the level of ambition.’ Over the years, cars have evolved to sprout wings, moved from ground-effect wedges to the wing-covered race cars of 2020 – and then back to the ground-effect all over again. Yet, the core of F1 has consistently focused on achieving peak performance. Is this what F1 is all about? The answer is yes, and in two different ways. Firstly, diversity and inclusion work has real benefits in performance: ‘We strongly believe diversity drives innovation and that’s making us a better team as well and an overall more performant one,’ Lord explains. ‘Diversity of background and more points of perspective, are all incredibly important for continuing to improve and drive performance forward across all the areas in which we operate.’ There are lots of other factors that determine track performance – it’s not just the composition of your workforce – but we believe we are becoming a stronger team as a result.’ What’s more, the sport needs to modernise. 2024 F1 is a bigger business than ever before, with shows like Drive to Survive helping to fuel an explosion in popularity – especially in North America and the Middle East. If F1 wants to continue attracting and engaging more eyeballs globally, it’ll need to reflect the people it wants to bring in. With that in mind, it’ll need to be and look like a more inclusive sport. Accelerate 25 will end in late 2025, and after that it still remains to be seen where Mercedes’ D&I efforts will go. It’s not lost on Lord however, with Brackley (the team’s HQ along with Brixworth) and Mercedes worldwide already working on what the next step for the brand is: ‘We have exceeded this [Accelerate 25] target and there’s work ongoing internally at the moment to define the next phase of action to continue to build on the work that we’ve begun in that period,’ Lord explains. What shape it’ll take is to be confirmed. ‘We are not there yet,’ Lord said of confirming the new goal, ‘but we’re conscious that this programme effectively runs to the end of 25.’ Expect more from Mercedes towards the end of the year.

The news puts to rest rumoured doubts about Audi’s planned 2026 entry Formula One, and will see a shuffle of senior key figures to look after the increased program. According to a release put out by Audi, Oliver Hoffmann will be responsible for the Audi Formula 1 program overall as a General Representative, while ex-McLaren team principal – also ex-Porsche WEC and ex-BMW F1 team – Andrew Seidl will take the reins as team principal. ‘We have a clear roadmap for how we want to become competitive in Hinwil as well as in Neuburg, said Seidl. ‘We have ambitious goals. Realization of them is in progress and will be further accelerated through the complete takeover of Sauber by AUDI AG.’ Hoffmann’s job will essentially unite the three pillars of Audi’s F1 efforts; the Sauber F1 team, the power unit division over in Neuburg (crucial for 2026) and the main Audi company’s involvement. It’s no simple task to unite such a fragmented team – just have a look how things at the Enstone/Viry based Alpine F1 team. As you’d expect, it’s a full-time job, so Hoffmann will now step down as a member of the board. ‘I would like to thank the entire team at Technical Development for the great performance in recent years, and I am proud of the outstanding products resulting from our intensive work that we will bring to the streets in the coming months,’ said Hoffmann. ‘Motorsport, particularly Formula 1, is my big passion. I am convinced that by bundling responsibilities and taking over 100 percent of Sauber Group, we will further accelerate our preparations for the launch in 2026.’ Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

706,Confirmed: Alfa Romeo's electric Giulia and Stelvio replacements coming from 2025,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/new-cars/,Jake Groves,2024-03-08,Car Magazine UK,"Alfa Romeo has confirmed that its next Stelvio and Giulia will arrive from 2025, with both being transformed into electric cars. The new-generation Stelvio SUV will launch in 2025, and the all-new Giulia saloon will follow on in 2026. The announcement also includes a confirmation that both new cars will use the ‘EV-native’ , with Alfa Romeo confirming it will be the first European brand to use the platform. The confirmation announcement also states that the Stelvio will be the first car in the Stellantis mega-group to use the upcoming new ‘STLA Brain’ computing system onboard, as well as the STLA SmartCockpit software. The official confirmation comes after CAR talked about Alfa Romeo’s future product plans back in 2022. Then, in relation to the next-generation Giulia that launches in 2026, Imparato vowed to deliver a no-compromise vehicle, with an 800-volt architecture (like a Porsche Taycan) for quick recharging and 700km (435 miles) of range in the high-performance Quadrifolgio version. To reduce charging downtime, Alfa is set to go first with an aerodynamic saloon-type body rather than an SUV. ‘Giulia is [coming] back!’ said the CEO in 2022. ‘We have to design the Giulia we love, an Alfa Romeo we all want, and [design director] Alejandro Mesonero-Romanos is on it. And we will come back to you with something that is very cool.’ [Our image is an artist’s impression by Andrei Avarvarii.] ‘It will have range, and from 350hp to 800hp as a Veloce, and 1000hp as a Quadrifoglio.’ The car is based on the Stellantis group’s stepchange electric car architecture, STLA, which can package its motors for front, rear and all-wheel drive. Expect the base car to be rear-drive, while the punchier cars will split power across both axles. Alfa is only selling the Tonale as a plug-in hybrid in North America to build its electric credentials, and the new Giulia will double down on that. The boss promises that Alfa EVs such as the Giulia will be a no-compromise substitution for a petrol car, not hamstrung by range and refuelling issues. That doesn’t mean an SUV won’t follow: indeed the Stelvio, the Giulia’s sister SUV, is odds-on for a 2026 introduction. And 2027 should see Alfa push into the E-segment, important for Chinese and American customers, most likely with a flagship SUV. ‘In 2027, we jump up on the E-segment that will be frozen in terms of intention and design by the end of 2023. But it is completely locked and funded in the company,’ said the former Peugeot CEO. All of this news comes as Alfa Romeo expands its portfolio considerably. The current-shape and were recently facelifted, and the brand pulled the covers off in 2023. On top of that, it isn’t long until we see the new Milano SUV, which will become Alfa’s smallest current car, using technology shared by the likes of the Jeep Avenger and Fiat 600e. This is Alfa Romeo’s current product plan, including recent new car launches: • 2023 – unveiled • 2023 – refreshes • 2023 – • 2024 – (a mild hybrid and pure EV crossover, filling gap left by Mito supermini) • 2025 – • 2026 – • 2027 – flagship (E-segment) Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

As well as offering its regular Sportback hatchback and Saloon model, a new A3 Allstreet variant joins the range. The visual tweaks are pretty minor, introducing a slightly sportier look to the car and includes a now-framless ‘Singleframe’ grille arrangement at the front. Bigger air intakes, new wheel designs and more interesting colours beyond Audi’s palette of greys (like District Green, pictured) feature in the range now. The A3’s daytime running lights now have customisable DRLs like the Q4 e-tron, too. Probably what’s more interesting is the introduction of a new A3 Allstreet model (pictured above). As well as some tougher-looking design elements stolen from Audi’s range of SUVs, the Allstreet features a 15mm raised ride height over a conventional Sportback hatch or saloon model and as-standard roof rails. The cockpit has had a bit of a refresh across all models, too, with Audi pointing to a longer list of standard equipment on even the base models. The details are only slight, mind, with some more elaborate ambient lighting and a new shifter being more obvious details. More tech has been injected into the A3, with a wider range of safety tech as standard (including adaptive cruise that even helps with lane changes) and additional parking and manoeuvrability tech. The engine range will sound remarkably familiar, too, with 148bhp petrol and diesel engines launching first. More engines will become available in the summer, and a plug-in hybrid model will launch by the end of 2024. As for performance versions, a new-generation S3 and RS3 will arrive later. We’ve already driven a prototype of the S3, and it’s . The updated range is available to order very soon, with the first deliveries expected in the summer.

And that’s after a pre-production model lopped 26 seconds off the Taycan’s quickest lap time around the Nürburgring. The already has more power from its available e-motors, but the Turbo GT pushes that ceiling even higher. Standard power from the Turbo GT and Turbo GT with the Weissach pack is 778bhp, lifting to 1019bhp when using launch control and with an overboost of up to 1092bhp available, meaning a 2.3sec 0-62mph sprint and a 0-124mph is done in 6.6sec. Top speed is rated at 180mph for a Taycan Turbo GT. As well as the car’s usual driving modes, the Taycan Turbo GT also features an ‘Attack mode’ inspired by . Attack mode gives you a short, 10-second power boost available at the push of a button – ‘and you can trigger the boost with racing gloves on, without taking your hand off the wheel,’ says Porsche development driver Lars Kern. As for handling and performance engineering, the Taycan Turbo GT features an adaptive spoiler that integrates a finished in black. Porsche’s Active Ride technology also features, which first launched with . Matrix LED lights are standard (because Porsche says they’re lighter), and the brand’s new satin grey Turbonite material (which first launched on the current Panamera) can be seen in various places. Inside, every Taycan Turbo GT model benefits from standard bucket seats and the brand’s GT steering wheel. Porsche says you can spec electric 18-way seats for no charge if you want more comfort (and weight). Much like the ’s most extreme GT models, the Taycan Turbo GT with the Weissach pack is much more about taking bits off than adding them. Specific lightweight detailing – including chucking out 70kg of ‘equipment not required for track driving,’ according to Porsche – helps to drop the 0-62mph sprint time to 2.2 seconds (or 0-124mph in 6.4sec) and ups the speed to 190mph. Part of that 70kg loss is due to the rear seats being removed, with the remaining two at the front upholstered in Porsche’s grippy, breathable Race-Tex fabric. The floor mats have been deleted, there’s less sound deadening and Porsche has even expunged one of the Taycan’s two charging ports to shave off a few kilos, as well as including a lightened version of the Bose stereo system. Even the glass is lighter. New wind deflection techniques for the underbody, as well as a more aggressive front splitter and a fixed carbonfibre wing are all standard for the Weissach pack. Porsche says the more aggressive pack adds up to 220kg of extra downforce. Spec a Weissach pack and you can also have your Turbo GT with GT Silver or Volt Blue interior trims. The new Taycan Turbo GT is priced from £186,300 – and in a move that’s a little bit unusual for Porsche, that starting figure is the same whether you want the standard version of the lightweight Weissach model.

709,Driving made smarter? We test Mercedes' latest automatic lane change tech,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/mercedes-lane-change/,Jake Groves,2024-03-12,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes seems determined to go right up to the limits of what’s legal when it comes to automated driving. There’s more tech waiting in the wings while legislation is agreed, but right now cars can be installed with a new feature for Merc’s . It’s called Automatic Lane Change (ALC), and that’s what it does. If you specify a C-Class, E-Class, S-Class or any with Merc’s Active Distance Assist and Active Steering Assist in its Distronic cruise control, ALC is included. It’s been available for a while in the US and Canada, and now it’s arriving in Europe. Previously, sophisticated adaptive cruise systems have had the ability to change lane but needed prompting by the driver, usually by tapping the indicator stalk. With ALC, the car makes its own decisions. Example: if you’re on the motorway with Distronic set to 70mph and you’re catching a slower-moving vehicle, the car will use all its available sensor data to check its surroundings and will change lane when conditions allow. The technology is integrated into the adaptive cruise system, so there’s no need to specifically switch ALC on, and it works between 49 and 87mph. As well as activating the indicator itself, the car will bong and light up an icon in the instrument cluster so you’re in no doubt about its actions. ALC also integrates into other parts of the car. For example, cars with Digital Light matrix LED headlights fitted will beam a guiding line from one lane to the other. Have a route planned? ALC will ensure you’re in the correct lane at junctions. We tested it on a new-generation Mercedes E-Class in Germany. There’s no sign that the technology is active at first, but it springs into life as you approach slow-moving traffic. Lane discipline is exemplary, switching to the inside when there’s enough space to do so but holding off if it sees another slow vehicle in the middle distance. The lane changes themselves were all smooth during our test. Indication starts a reasonable time before the act of actually changing lanes begins, to allow other motorists to see you and to give you an opportunity to override the car’s impending decision. It makes well-judged decisions and delivers smooth results. Impressive, and more than a little uncanny. The car gives a visual prompt in the instrument cluster as well as a bong when it’s initiating a lane change. Holding the wheel is recommended but inessential. ALC works with Digital Light tech so a light beam points from the lane you’re in to the one you’re moving into, making your intentions clearer after dark. Working with the nav, ALC will prepare you for junctions and slip roads by moving into the appropriate lane. It adjusts its speed for smooth transitions. Yes. Frankly, it’s surreal how well it worked during our real-world test. Its decision-making processes are well-judged, lane changes are smooth and its integration with other features of the car only make you want to use it more.

710,New VW ID.3 GTX revealed: Wolfsburg’s electric hot(ish) hatch has arrived,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-3-gtx/,Jake Groves,2024-03-13,Car Magazine UK,"Could this be VW’s electric hot hatch? Say hello to the new, long-awaited Volkswagen ID.3 GTX. It’s potentially the ID.3 some will have been waiting for, promising a lot more performance and a bigger range to boot. The trouble is, Cupra has slightly stolen Volkswagen’s thunder a little here as has largely the same technology. Even so, Volkswagen has put some effort into the ID.3 GTX and the results don’t sound too bad at all. Well, as close to it as we can be with Volkswagen’s GTX branding. The name hasn’t gotten off to the best start with the and models being pretty lukewarm to drive, and after this generation of ID. cars goes away. But VW will offer two versions of the ID.3 GTX and both will be rear-wheel drive: a 210kW (282bhp) model and a 240kW (322bhp) version. ‘Think of it like and ,’ ’ says ID.3 product manager, Claas-Lennard Stöhr. ‘At first we had the 210kW version, but then we found such a solution that allowed us to go up to 240kW. Here we’re doing some things that we’ve never done before with a GTX model.’ And one of the biggest departures from the usual GTX fare is that the most potent ID.3 models are rear-wheel drive only after that breakthrough in electric motor technology. ‘The X in GTX doesn’t especially mean all-wheel drive,’ says Stöhr, ‘it’s the body design and the dynamic abilities. And this car [the ID.3 GTX] is kind of like a love story to the Golf GTI.’ Both models feature a new 79kWh battery pack and up to 175kW DC charging, and both generate 402lb ft of torque at their peak. The ID.3 GTX maxes out at 111mph, while the more powerful ID.3 GTX Performance tops out at 124mph, and Volkswagen says a maximum range of 372 miles is possible. GTX models benefit from revised steering and specific chassis tuning right out of the box. Choose the ID.3 GTX Performance model and VW throws in a sportier version of the brand’s DCC adaptive chassis control and slightly slacker traction control. Naturally, the GTX model benefits from a slightly more aggressive bodykit than a regular ID.3 and features the sub-brand’s triangular lighting signature that sits in the lower corners of the front bumper. Every GTX model features 20-inch wheels as standard. Inside, GTX models get sporty seats in microfibre fabric and they also benefit from VW’s new-generation MIB4 infotainment system with its customisable screens and cleaner look. The tech promises much better processing power than the old system that launched on the original ID.3. Our tests so far conclude that it is better than the old system, but still relies almost entirely on touchscreen controls. Here, the system is said to make its way onto UK cars, after facelifted ID.3 models were originally denied the new tech. Timings are TBC, with Volkswagen only confirming for now that the ID.3 GTX models will ‘have their market introduction this year.’ Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

711,This is our first look at Skoda’s new Epiq small EV,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/skoda/epiq/,Jake Groves,2024-03-15,Car Magazine UK,"Skoda has given us our first glimpse at its next electric car: a small crossover which will be named the Epiq. This first look is described as a ‘design study’ that previews the upcoming production model that will officially launch in 2025. The new Epiq will be the first car to use quite a considerable amount of the brand’s new ‘Modern Solid’ design language, which kicked off with which . Head of Skoda design, Oliver Stefani, says the Epiq design study ‘perfectly embodies all the key attributes of the new design language.’ Details from the Vision 7S include T-shape DRLs front and rear, as well as thick grey cladding trimming the lower valance of the car. Flecks of orange can be seen in the wheels and bumpers, Inside, Skoda says the Epiq will be full of recycled materials and, naturally, some of its Simply Clever touches. An evolution of the brand’s current two-spoke steering wheel will feature, and the infotainment will likely be a version of Skoda’s MIB4 technology. Skoda says the Epiq is 4.1 metres long, making it around the same length as the brand’s supermini, and claims that the boot will be a comparatively large 490 litres. When the production model version arrives, Skoda says it will benefit from an electric range of over 248 miles. The result of this is due to using MEB Small – the same battery-electric architecture being used by VW for its and the . Both the VW and Cupra are also scheduled for 2025.

712,"Lancia reveals new HF performance logo, hints at return to rallying",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/lancia/new-hf-logo/,CJ Hubbard,2024-03-15,Car Magazine UK,"Lancia has revealed a new HF logo. Younger members of the audience are probably going: who? Older ones, possibly: so what? But the updated HF badge means the new crop of Lancia will include range-topping high-performance variants, starting with a 236bhp version of the . If all goes to plan – and with Lancia, even backed by Stellantis, who knows – this will then be followed by further HF models as the new expands. Furthermore, at the unveiling of the new HF logo, Lancia brand CEO Luca Napolitano hinted that a return to rallying might also be on the cards. Now that is a tantalising prospect… In Lancia terms, HF stands for Hi-Fi – in turn short for high-fidelity. But this is not about how good the stereo system is. Rather the association originates from 1960, when a group of Lancia enthusiasts founded the Lancia Hi-Fi Club, introducing the original HF logo at the same time. Membership was limited to those who had owned at least six Lancias – clearly they’ve been a diehard breed from the very start. Ther HF initials then appeared on some sporting models before properly beginning the journey into legend with the foundation of the HF Lancia Racing Team in 1963. It’s at this point the elephant appears. Four originally, reducing to just the single stampeding beasty over time. The new logo is far from radical, but is slightly simplified. The red, white and black colours were chosen for their origin on the 1966 – which became a hugely successful rally car – while the slanted lettering is a reference to the HF logo used on the . The probably needs no introduction, but the inclination of the letters is supposed to express speed and radicality. There’s a bit of myth and uncertainty about this, but the explanation new Lancia is going with refers back to Gianni Lancia – son of founder Vincenzo Lancia, and CEO from 1949-1955 – who apparently considered the elephant a lucky charm. Doesn’t seem the most obvious choice for a racing product, but the idea is supposedly that ‘once launched into a race, elephants are unstoppable’. Lancia also refers to ‘Eastern mythology’, where the elephant is a symbol of good luck and victory – ‘as long as it is represented with the trunk extended forward.’ Lancia has confirmed: ‘The Lancia Ypsilon HF will have a lowered suspension, widened track, will be 100% electric with a 240 horsepower engine, and an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h [62mph] in just 5.8 seconds.’ Sounds ok, if not exceptional. Especially since it will be based on the same platform and technology as all those other small Stellatis EVs. Perhaps more interestingly, CEO Napolitano also had this to say on the reveal of the new logo: ‘Today we take another step ahead in the path to Renaissance, to emphasize the brand [sic] most brutal and radical soul and its commitment to focusing on performance models.’ So perhaps those chassis upgrades will be a little more than visual window dressing in this instance. We remain to be convinced… Napolitano again: ‘Will we return to the Rally? [sic] We are working on it.’ This would seem somewhat tricky given Lancia is setting itself up as an EV-only manufacturer from this point onwards, and the World Rally Championship hasn’t even found it possible to carry on using hybrid technology (due to the expense). But if anything can make the prospect of a forest stage singing to the tune of multiple electric motors seem exciting, maybe a new Lancia Delta HF Integrale can.

713,New Mercedes-AMG E53 uses 6cyl hybrid power,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/mercedes-benz/amg-e53/,Jake Groves,2024-03-15,Car Magazine UK,"Mercedes-AMG’s efforts to electrify its range of super-powered models continues with the new E53 saloon and estate. Naturally, the E53 is visually distinct enough from with fat round tailpipes, bespoke bodykit and wheel designs. E53 models benefit from rear-wheel steering and can be had with the E-Class’ Superscreen technology. The new AMG model uses a combination of a 443bhp 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six, which has been derived from the very good previous model. A 160bhp e-motor is coupled into the powertrain, with a total system output of 577bhp being sent to all four wheels. But, buried deep within the car’s brain is a Race Start mode that boosts total power to 604bhp from a standstill, meaning a 0-62mph sprint in as little as 3.8 seconds is possible. Add on the AMG Dynamic Plus package and you benefit from a maximum top speed of 174mph in the saloon (up from a limited 155mph). That pack also throws in an AMG Performance steering wheel, composite brakes with red calipers, revised algorithms for the rear differential and dynamic engine mounts. You also need this pack in order to get that Race Start function. When you’re not driving like your hair’s on fire, AMG also claims that the E53 is capable of around 62 miles of e-range from its rather-large-for-a-PHEV 28.6kWh battery pack. The battery can also be DC charged, with a 10-80 per cent charge being done in 20 minutes. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

714,‘World’s Fastest One-Make Racing Series’ – BAC Mono Cup announced for Winter 2024,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/bac/bac-mono-cup/,James Dennison,2024-03-18,Car Magazine UK,"BAC (or Briggs Automotive Company to give it its full name) is best known for its small, super-lightweight road-going single seaters that snaffle up lap records like Max Verstappen does purple sectors in Grand Prix qualifying. A small outfit based in Liverpool (that now exports cars to 47 countries),it knows a thing or two about being market disruptors. So, rather than do what every other performance car maker seems to be doing and build an SUV, BAC has gone and created itself a one-make racing series set to kick-off in 2024 in Saudi Arabia. Called the Mono Cup, it’ll use an adapted racing version of the Mono and promises to deliver an exciting experience for both viewers and drivers alike. To find out more, we sat down with Ian Briggs (founder and design director at BAC) for a quick chat to see what the series is all about. Well, I think that the first thing is obviously that it’s a single seater formula style. Unlike Formula cars, it has enclosed wheels. So, in terms of safety in the kind of incidents that you would sometimes see in single seaters, then it obviously avoids that. Also, I think the big one is performance. The positioning of the of the Mono Cup is in quite a narrow void, or almost a blurred boundary between the upper echelons of single-make championship racing, which you would single out the likes of Porsche Supercup, Lamborghini Trofeo and Ferrari Challenge – that type of series – and then the Formula 4, 3 and 2 space which is predominantly made up of career aspirational drivers. In that void, you’ve obviously got the crossover from single-make series that I mentioned into GT3, Blancpain, that kind of thing, where budgets are several million euros a year and cars are very expensive. It’s populated by a mixture of gentleman drivers and professional drivers and Mono Cup will be similar in the sense that it’s an International C race licence (required to partake). We are vying to be the fastest one make championship in the world. We know from our performance testing with the current cars where we sit, and we know that the Cup car will be quicker, which means that we can quite confidently make that make that statement. The series is on an arrive-and-drive basis – there’s one entity that will run all the cars. That’s in order to provide a neutrality of equipment and neutrality of performance. But the key one is is that, traditionally, there would be a qualifying session, and the fast guy starts at the front and the slower guy starts at the back – that means racing’s perhaps not always quite as exciting as it could be. If you wander down to your local karting track, you’ll see that karting’s been around for 50-60 years with a well-proven split grid or mixed grid style. So, (in Mono Cup) we’ll have two heats and a final, which means that everyone will get to start at the front and everyone will get to start at the back. And throughout the six race weekends everyone will start on each row of the grid which will then be reversed for their second heat and the aggregate results of those two heats will give them their grid position for the final. You’ll see a lot of overtaking which is exciting, plus the associated thrills and spills with that. And from a driver skill perspective you’ll get to see not just who’s the fastest, but who’s good in traffic, who’s patient, how they manage slower drivers, where they choose to overtake and all that good stuff. So it is a real breath of fresh air in true BAC disruptive fashion. I think it’s 20% of Formula One races are now happening within the Middle East, so you can see that there are exceptional circuits. Obviously, weather becomes less of an issue in the Middle East. And because it’s a winter series, you know, we can expect temperatures to be typical, but not too extreme. It is also a huge growth area, certainly as far as the car industry is concerned. And I think certainly, as far as the Middle East is concerned, it’s an area where we should be as a brand. BAC Saudi Arabia has got off to a screaming start. Yeah, so ride height and pitch is defined by BAC, as are spring rates and camber. The tyres are also fixed and supplied by Pirelli. But you will be able to personalise the car in terms of brake balance and damper settings. So the dampers are an evolution of the current platform. They are adjustable, but they’re also adjustable for high speed and low speed. So depending on your preference, if you’d like a car with a bit more front end, or a looser rear end, or whatever, you will be able to tweak the car. But what it means is we can control what we’re doing, we know where the car performs best, we know the window in which it performs best, and then the driver will be able to tweak based on their personal setup around there. So from a sort of operational management perspective, it will be quite straightforward to operate and look after these cars. But that’s a long-winded answer of saying yes, you will have your own engineer and there will be a technician that manages the car for you. And there will be a data truck where you’ll be able to sit down with the engineers look at your performance versus perhaps some of your competitors. We’ll also have driver coaches on hand as well. And then we’re also going to have some performance coaches who will look after things like food, wellness, hydration, that kind of thing to make sure that obviously competing in in that kind of environment that the drivers are as well looked after as possible. Again, very good question. And yes, is the answer. So, you know, everything we do a BAC is designed for a purpose. We’re obviously a design innovation led business, but everything we do is to fulfil a need. And so what you will see on the Cup car will be cascaded down into the into the products that are available for upgrades but also onto the road as well.

715,Will AI make your new car better?,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/ai-in-cars/,Jake Groves,2024-03-18,Car Magazine UK,"It seems you can’t move these days without discussions, debates and dog whistles surrounding generative AI. The car industry, like many others, is looking into how the technology can be used in the future – whether that involves the design and manufacture of cars, or improving the experience of the driver and passengers. A collection of algorithms that can be used to generate new content, including text, images and audio. Tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard respond to prompts from users in text form. DALL-E, a tool that’s recently been incorporated into Microsoft’s Bing search engine, is one of many generative AI programs that can create images. It’s these tools that are rapidly becoming more common in the automotive world, chiefly to augment a car’s infotainment (rather than anything directly connected with driving). DS kickstarted a trial to add ChatGPT into its Iris infotainment system, while Mercedes and Volkswagen are going one step further by installing the tech into all their cars running and MIB4 operating systems respectively. will also feature a voice assistant named Reno that uses AI algorithms. ‘In this world, hype comes and goes – but this is not the case with AI,’ says Mercedes’ chief technology officer, Markus Schäfer. ‘It got more intense with the introduction of ChatGPT and there is much more focus now. We’re taking all the learnings that we have over the last nine months with ChatGPT in the car and what we have announced is the next development of that.’ Having generative AI installed into your car, according to many car makers, allows a higher degree of personalisation and a natural way of communication between human and machine. DS, for example, says its updated Iris voice assistant allows it to be a travel companion, suggesting good restaurants at your destination or telling your bored kids stories to keep them occupied. AI will also be used in the new Arene operating system from Toyota/Lexus, due to appear in production cars from 2026, that promises a much more personal infotainment experience. Behind the scenes, AI is being used in production, with car makers claiming benefits to both cost and the environment. At its Rastatt plant Mercedes is deploying AI to simulate a production line for its next-generation MMA platform-based EVs without interrupting the ongoing manufacturing of the current A-Class, B-Class, GLA and EQAs coming down the line. In the paint shop, it’s reduced the energy usage of top layers by 20 per cent. Renault Group boss Luca de Meo points out: ‘We have developed AI tools to efficiently fill our trucks and provide optimised routes, allowing us to use 8000 fewer on the road and avoiding around 21,000 tonnes of CO2.’ There are, however, risks. Besides putting human jobs in the firing line, generative AI tools regularly run the risk of copyright infringements or being plain wrong. ‘It’s not something you implement in a car and then just leave it,’ says Schäfer, the Merc tech chief. ‘If you sit in a car and ChatGPT tells you something that’s absolute nonsense, you might be exposed to product liability cases.’ So car makers are proceeding with caution. But they are definitely proceeding into this game-changing new era. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

716,New seven-seat Peugeot e-5008 and 5008 has electric and hybrid options,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/peugeot/5008/,Jake Groves,2024-03-20,Car Magazine UK,"Peugeot has pulled the covers off its new-generation 5008 SUV, launching a new electric e-5008 model with it. The new e-5008 is, unsurprisingly, closely linked to – just like previous versions have been, offering a larger passenger space area while still aiming to keep the look largely the same. Peugeot is using the ‘EV native’ (which basically means it isn’t EV-only) platform, which allows the brand to offer a mild hybrid model as well as an electric model from launch, with a plug-in hybrid model to follow. Dare we say ‘Russian Doll’? No bad thing per se – the new e-3008 is certainly a striking thing to look at, if perhaps not outwardly handsome – but this new e-5008 model certainly looks distinct. The new e-5008 shares the same front end as the 3008, with its triple DRL design either side, high beltline, and eye-catching wheel designs. In fact, there’s very little to set the two apart visually – aside from the more upright rear end that’s designed to house those two extra seats. It’s the same inside, with the fabric-upholstered sweeping dashboard and large curved panel housing the ‘panoramic i-Cockpit’ instruments and a big central display. There are physical switches, integrated neatly into the 5008’s sculptured dashboard, and you can spec premium seats approved by AGR (Aktion Gesunder Rücken, or Campaign for Healthier Backs). The infotainment is Peugeot’s new i-Connect Advanced system, which includes a natural voice assistant that is ChatGPT-enabled and features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The new e-5008 will come with three powertrain options: Electric 210, Electric 230 Long Range and Electric 320 Dual Motor. On top of that, though Peugeot has confirmed the regular 5008 will feature a 134bhp mild hybrid combustion engine mated to a new six-speed dual-clutch transmission, and a plug-in hybrid model will arrive in 2025. The second row slides 60:40, and the backrests are split 40:20:40. Each of the second row’s backrests recline, and Peugeot claims easy access to the third row of seats with one simple mechanism, too. Peugeot says the boot space is rated to 259 litres with all seats up, 748 litres in five-seat mode and 1815 litres with all of them down, revealing a flat loading area. Not quite as big as the new Skoda Kodiaq, but reasonably competitive. Orders will open for the new e-5008 electric model, as well as the mild hybrid petrol 5008, in the autumn of 2024. The plug-in hybrid version will go on sale in 2025. Jake has been an automotive journalist since 2015, joining CAR as Staff Writer in 2017.

717,A beefy Bulli: VW’s new 335bhp ID. Buzz GTX revealed,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/volkswagen/id-buzz-gtx/,Jake Groves,2024-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"VW’s warm, electric GTX sub-brand has gained another model: this is the ID. Buzz GTX. The big, boxy and retro-modern MPV, in GTX form, is now one of VW’s most powerful models in the range right now alongside the . As well as offering short- and long-wheelbase options, VW says its most powerful Buzz is a capable tow car. Albeit with some new wheel designs, and a new Cherry red paint colour available. You can choose from some natty diamond cut or black 21-inch wheels over the as-standard 19-inchers, and that red paint can be applied single-tone or dual-tone with silver. These details, as well as a glowing front VW badge and some new chevron-shaped DRLs at the front, are about the extent of the visual tweaks the GTX benefits from. Inside, VW’s gone for dark and moody blacks and reds rather than the more colourful options seen on other Buzz models. Electric memory seats are standard in the front, and all of the chairs inside are upholstered in a dark grey microfibre material and embossed with GTX lettering. The new GTX model also benefits from VW’s latest-generation infotainment system, too. As mentioned, the GTX is available as a short-wheelbase (five-seat) model, or a long-wheelbase (available with either six or seven seats) version. Go for the long-wheelbase model and you can specify a glass sunroof that features a liquid crystal tinting effect to shade the sunlight. Well, the battery size and a few other details depend on what wheelbase you get. Short-wheelbase models come with an 84kWh battery pack and can be charged at up to 180kW; the long-wheelbase model has a 91kWh battery pack and can be charged at up to 200kW. VW also says the ID. Buzz comes with competitive towing capacities, with the short-wheelbase model having a 1800kg braked trailer capacity and the long-wheelbase model featuring a 1600kg capacity. Other than that, though, power and performance is about the same: Buzz GTX models all feature two e-motors for 335bhp of all-wheel drive grunt. VW claims a circa-6.5sec 0-62mph sprint time and 99mph top speed. Range figures, however, aren’t public yet. The new, warm Buzz GTX will launch in the summer of 2024.

718,Stunningly restored Lotus Carlton for sale,https://www.pistonheads.com/regulars/ph-spottedykywt/stunningly-restored-lotus-carlton-for-sale/50095,Matt Bird,2025-07-20,PistonHeads,"It’s all too easily said, and oh-so-often heard, that new fast cars aren’t like old fast cars. Largely because they aren’t, of course. But that’s always been the way: technology, tastes and legislation change, so inevitably the products do as well. Problem being at the moment is that everything seems a bit out of kilter because the market has diverged from what some buyers actually want. Or even what manufacturers would prefer to be selling, were they given a free hand. Which is a long way of saying the new Vauxhall Mokka GSE probably won’t be met with the warmest reception when it’s fully revealed soon. Not a proper GSE, not a proper hot Vaux, that sort of thing. But something surely has to be better than nothing in these barren times, and it is Vauxhall tradition to spring the odd surprise. Perhaps it’ll be a Meriva VXR for the electric age… The Lotus Carlton was most certainly not like anything before it, or very much after it for that matter, which is why it’s forged such a reputation as a fast car icon. There had been GSi versions of the Carlton, of course (and if anyone knows of a 24-valve 3000, send it my way), plus the GSE Monzas, but nothing so overtly performance-focused - or with specialist input from a sports car maker. Omegas offered here were never more potent than a 3.2-litre MV6, and while the rebadged Holdens were deeply cool, they were a different prospect really. It was a unique creation, the LC, and a uniquely awesome one as well. These days, it is harder than ever to make your mark, because there are ordinary family cars out there capable of 0-62mph in less than four seconds. Add that to motorsport-spec dampers on hot hatches, differentials that could rotate the world the other way and eminently tuneable engines, and you can see how hard it is to reach the edge of the envelope. Imagine a Vauxhall coming out now even more powerful than a BMW M5, even faster, and even more expensive. YouTube would grind to a halt. There’s no point dwelling on the Lotus Carlton story for too long. Like that final in 1966, the semi in 1986, Love Actually or the lyrics to Bittersweet Symphony, we’re all familiar with it by now. Suffice it to say that the palaver associated with getting a Carlton straight six to 3.6 litres, adding two turbos and running the Corvette ZR-1 six-speed was more than worth the effort. Always highly desirable super-saloons, LCs are now stone-cold six-figure classics. There weren’t very many in the first place, and that first place was more than 30 years ago now; plenty will have suffered an ignominious fate with that much power and rear-wheel drive. This one, number 882, must be one of the very best left in existence. Not only is the mileage incredibly low at 21,000, it’s also been freshly and extensively restored - to the tune of £18,000. Bless it, the poor old Carlton hasn’t done very much since 2005, which is a bit of shame. Back then, it was showing 19,777 miles; at its MOT last month it was on 20,912. But far from being a barn find, that money spent in 2023 means it now looks ready to rule the road all over again. The advert suggests it’s a ‘truly unrepeatable opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts alike.’ It’s pretty damn magnificent just to gawp at, let alone drive. Those wheels have never looked better, the paint is pristine, the interior gorgeous and the original numberplates a lovely detail. A low mileage example should always have presented nicely, but whatever was done a couple of years ago really has brought the best from it. There’s not anywhere a Lotus Carlton won’t be the centre of attention for all the right reasons. A supercar saloon, if you will - with the price tag now to match…"

720,"BMW Neue Klasse X: the electric SUV of the future, on sale in 2025",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/bmw/vision-neue-klasse-x-concept-car/,CJ Hubbard,2024-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"We’ve already seen the saloon, now BMW is showing us the of the future with this second Neue Klasse concept, the Neue Klasse X. While perhaps not as instantly radical as the first, the more you look, the more you see – and at least it’s a visual improvement over other recent BMW SUVs. The Neue Klasse X is based on the same (EV) platform as the , which promises an increase in overall efficiency of 25 per cent – and an increase in driving range of 30 per cent. And like the Neue Klasse saloon, this is no flight of fancy; the Neue Klasse X is coming to production. In fact, the SUV arrives first, with the new BMW i factory in Hungary already gearing up to start churning them out in 2025, a year ahead of the saloon. It sure does – it’s much less edgy and divisive than the other recent BMW SUVs. Head of BMW i Design Kai Langer tells of his desire to make cars sporty but not aggressive, and you can see that in action here. There’s also a clear link between the X and the saloon, in terms of the large windows and smooth surfacing. The latter reflects BMW’s desire to reduce the number of individual components and improve sustainability – check out the debossed BMW badge on the bonnet as a signifier of this – a theme that continues into the interior. The former is a deliberate move to try and recapture the light and airy feel present when driving classic cars. There are more classic references in the bluff front end and the distinctive but not overwhelming kidney grilles. These are defined by light rather than chrome to give them a forward-looking aspect as well – their prominence will also be unique to Neue Klasse SUV models. BMW’s brand spanking Neue Klasse electric vehicle platform, which uses sixth-generation BMW e-drive technology. This includes new cylindrical battery cells – bigger for the SUV – in place of the previous prismatic pouches, and a range of other methods to increase efficiency. That promise of driving range increased by nearly a third is compared to a current generation equivalent – the . This is a level of improvement we’ve already seen possible in the , so BMW’s brand-new kit should certainly be able to deliver. There’s further optimisation in the form of gen-six e-motors, but also the fundamental electronic architecture of the Neue Klasse platform, which is run using just four ‘superbrains’ in place of the previous multitude of individual ECUs. The firm’s favourite example is the new driving ECU – apparently nicknamed ‘ ’, this was developed and programmed in-house, and is said to operate 10 times faster than the previous set-up. But what’s supposed to be really special is that it integrates management of every powertrain and driving dynamics function into one unit. This means the e-motors, chassis, steering and suspension are all controlled from the same place, speeding up their collaborative decision making. This is so effective that according to head of ‘driving experience requirements’ Alexander Karajlovic, you get more response from the same amount of power. Not that the Neue Klasse will be short of this – the full-spec M variants will be quad-motor monsters developing in the region of 1000bhp. Regular versions will be more sensible single- and dual-motor, but still faster and more efficient than what we’ve seen from BMW before. Every Neue Klasse model will get this same ultra-powerful driving system controller. One of the others takes care of all the assisted and . Replacing four previously individual ECUs, this will come in two variants, depending on the spec of the car: L2 autonomous driving for more basic models, L3 autonomous driving for fancy trims. The other two superbrains take care of the infotainment and non-driving functions, such as the lights and wipers. Everything here has been considered for performance – including the position of the ECUs within the vehicle to allow for optimised (and therefore faster and weight-reduced) wiring looms. As funky fresh as the Neue Klasse saloon – which is to say there are again fewer individual components, and emphasis on recyclability, and some pretty wacky upholstery and trim. More pertinently, there aren’t very many buttons. BMW has abandoned the fable iDrive rotary controller completely now, in favour of touch control or – perhaps more usefully – voice control. This sparked a bit of a row in the press conference, but BMW is sticking to its guns (or simply didn’t have time to reverse development while it watched for going down a similar path). Innovations to take note of are a new 3D head-up display and the Panoramic Vision Display – both coming to production. The HUD explains itself; Panoramic Vision, meanwhile, is a full-width band just below the windscreen that can be customised to passenger requirements by a selection of widgets, sent there from the central touchscreen (itself now a natty parallelogram, following the bespoke path set by the circular screen in the latest ). It looks slick, and the whole infotainment setup promises to be smoking fast and highly customisable, meaning not only visual skins but also the option to change the virtual driving sounds on the fly. We’ll reserve judgement on the lack of buttons until we’ve tried the finished article. No-one at BMW will publicly admit this yet, but the Neue Klasse X is the – just as the Neue Klasse saloon will become the new i3 in 2026. Both will sit alongside conventional petrol, diesel and hybrid models, as BMW is far from abandoning ICE just yet. But those companion cars will be based on other technology, as the Neue Klasse platform is electric alone, in order to deliver what BMW promises will be a step-change in not just appearance but holistic performance. This is ‘the future of driving pleasure’ according to Karajlovic, and BMW having ‘fundamentally rethought the car’ according to the overall head of Neue Klasse BMW, Dr. Mike Reichelt. It certainly looks and sounds very impressive – here’s hoping it delivers. ‘Nothing is more important than the Neue Klasse,’ Reichelt emphasises. We’re baited.

722,Seat and Cupra’s future: ‘it has always been clear’,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/seat/future-direction/,Jake Groves,2024-03-21,Car Magazine UK,"The Seat brand isn’t going anywhere, according to Seat S.A.’s CEO. After months of speculation and confusion over the Seat brand’s future as the Cupra brand continues to rise in popularity, Wayne Griffiths has responded in an effort to clarify the brand’s strategy going forward. Volkswagen brand boss, and Seat S.A. chairman of the board, Thomas Schäfer, said to journalists (including CAR) at the IAA Mobility show in Munich in 2023 that ‘the future of Seat is Cupra.’ Since then, the automotive industry has been awash with speculation about the future direction of what looks like a brand that’s being starved of significant investment, having had no significant new product launches of note since the seven-seat that launched in 2018 and in 2020. Addressing the confusion and speculation, Seat S.A.’s 2024 Annual Media Conference, Griffiths said: ‘I never deliberately left it open [to interpretation]. For me it was always clear but there has been some unclarity outside of the business. For us and our 15,000 employees that work in Seat, why would you let a brand that’s existed for 70 years disappear? ‘The question is when is the right time to do what? When is the right time for which priority? My priority as president of the company is giving a future to the company, and that future is electrification – Cupra is necessary as well to give that future.’ And that plan seems to be working: Cupra is one of the fastest-growing car brands in Europe at the moment and the overall Seat S.A. group ‘posted the best financial results in its 73-year history,’ according to Griffiths. That electrified future that Griffiths speaks of includes future models like the , plug-in hybrid SUV and ID.2-based electric supermini are on the way. The brand has even been able to create wild concept cars like the . Griffiths points out the Cupra brand’s wider margins in the brand’s financial results announced at the 2024 conference, whereby revenue per Cupra vehicle is 34 per cent higher than a Seat one. ‘The Cupra margins illustrated in our results… we need that to invest in the future and we will continue investing in Seat,’ says Griffiths. ‘With the new availability of semiconductors, we can push on the Seat volumes again and you will see Seat bouncing back.’ As Cupra electrifies, Griffiths maintains there’s still a place for Seat. However, future steps are still tentative, as the strategy seems to be maintaining course as much as possible – even as the Seat brand reported ‘double digit’ sales growth in 2023. ‘We will be investing in combustion cars and looking at when is the right time to do an electric Seat. Today’s not the right time – it wouldn’t be profitable, and we can’t divert our investments into things that don’t guarantee future sustainability for the company. Not yet,’ says Griffiths. As well as potentially electrifying in the years to come, it’s long been discussed that Seat could turn into a ‘mobility brand’, selling smaller mobility devices like scooters – with the MO scooter just the start.

753,New CLA Shooting Brake is Merc's first EV wagon,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-germancars/new-cla-shooting-brake-is-mercs-first-ev-wagon/50078,Matt Bird,2025-07-15,PistonHeads,"While it’s hard to move for battery powered SUVs right now, the electric estate remains a far rarer breed. There’s and , yes, plus the (which is really good), but not much else besides. There isn’t even a Volvo yet. So the arrival of a CLA Shooting Brake with EQ Technology is reasonably important; always interesting but a niche seller, it’s now Mercedes’ first EV estate. Surely it won’t be the last. It’s a bigger car than the old CLA SB, growing by 35mm in length, 25mm in width, 27mm in height and, probably most importantly, 61mm in wheelbase. Passengers up front get more legroom than before, passengers in the rear get a tiny bit less, and all benefit from some extra headroom. Boot capacity for the CLA Shooting Brake with EQ Technology is 455 litres with the seats up and 1,290 with them down - 20 and 60 litres less, respectively, than the combustion engined model. But then the old car didn’t have 100 litres of frunk up front. The boot also boasts an EASY-PACK tailgate (whatever one of those us), four tiedown anchors, a side net and a 12-volt socket, so there’s some substance for the style. Mercedes says the socket might work for a picnic cooler. Interestingly towing capacity (now it really is a family weekend away) is up for rear-wheel drive CLA models, from 1,400kg to 1,500kg braked; it’s 1,800kg for the all-wheel drive 350 4Matic, or ‘a considerable towing capacity for an electric vehicle in this segment’ according to Mercedes. While clearly a different visual proposition to what came before and , the Shooting Brake hasn’t fallen too far from the tree. Indeed up to the B-pillar this is identical to the four-door, complete with 142 LED three-pointed stars where the grille once was and a ‘sporty shark-nose design’. The estate part is more gradual than the traditional wagon, as per Mercedes tradition since the first CLS Shooting Brake in 2012, tapering to a spoiler that’s black on the inside and body coloured on its outside. That’s meant to make the stunning pano roof, illuminated with 158 LED stars, look like it’s extending all the way from one screen to the other. Speaking of screens, the Shooting Brake interior is carried over from the CLA we’ve already seen. Best not dwell on it for too long, then, but it remains pretty special for what’s likely to be a sub-£50k car. Not least thanks to a new multifunction wheel that returns roller and rocker switches in place of the fiddly, smeary haptic items - huzzah. But there’s also infotainment across a 10.25-inch driver’s screen, 14-inch central display (remember when that was a small TV?) plus the optional passenger screen of the same dimensions. Games can be played through your phone (with graphics supported by Unity Game Engine), the Mercedes Benz Operating System is here for only the second time, and there’s something called Electric Intelligence in the nav to minimise charging times with real time info. So a good time to talk powertrains. The CLA Shooting Brake will launch with the same pair of EV options as the saloon: a 272hp, rear-drive 250+, and a 349hp, 350 4Matic. Merc’s new hybrid will follow soon after. The EV pair are powered by an 85kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery, with peak DC charging power of 320kW and at least 300 maintained by both after 10 minutes. Efficiency and range are a little behind the saloon, if still impressive: 473 miles is claimed for the 250, with anything up to 4.89mi/kWh, and 454 for the dual-motor car; its best-case electric mpg is 4.7mi/kWh. Mathias Geisen, Mercedes’ board member for sales, said: “The new CLA Shooting Brake is designed for those who appreciate the dynamism of a sporty vehicle but don’t want to compromise on space and practicality in everyday life. It combines intelligent technology and efficiency to deliver a fresh, engaging driving experience. For our customers, this means more space for individuality, travelling and for their own personal lifestyle.” Expect it on sale in March next year."

755,"2026 Range Rover Electric | First drive",https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-driven/2026-range-rover-electric--first-drive/50077,Nic Cackett,2025-07-15,PistonHeads,"Consider, for a moment, the furore over Jaguar going electric. The implications of insisting that the brand required a production full stop before embarking on its new era. Then the fall-out associated with not just the wholesale (and arguably ill-timed) powertrain switch, but also what a new generation of cars would look and feel like. Factor in the contentiousness of the messaging surrounding these events - Jaguar seemingly intent on handing some commentators easy-win ammunition - and you end up with a freakish sort of freight train careening down the line: loud, jam-packed with many compartments and no little notoriety, ostensibly unconcerned with where it has been and yet hugely apprehensive about where it is going to end up. Whether terminal crash or epoch-worthy smash awaits next year, it is unquestionably one of the defining stories of the zero-emission era. Save for the means of propulsion, is its polar opposite in virtually every respect. JLR has calculated, not unreasonably, that a stagnant Jaguar brand requires explosive change to save it; the Range Rover meanwhile, uniquely and overpoweringly popular, needs no fireworks whatsoever. That it exists and functions within expectations (no small ask) will likely be sufficient for it to become, relatively speaking, another sales behemoth. We know this because Land Rover already has over 60,000 statements of interest, many of them amassed at the announcement stage - but also because the messaging (in stark contrast to the scattergun approach used for Jaguar) is no different to previous Range Rover reveals: it will be new and better, but fundamentally the same. This quality of sameness is clearly a source of comfort to the team developing the car - a team well-stocked with engineers who have worked on Range Rover since Eastnor first acquired a fax machine - although not without the usual anxieties about living up to a reputation that successfully straddles both luxury and off-road segments. Happily for it, the usual platitudes about the advantages of battery power do ring true for both core concerns: as it does for rivals Rolls-Royce and Bentley, being silent and effortless and peerlessly refined are going to do the current Range Rover no harm, ditto the instantaneous torque delivery and the near limitless possibilities for how and where it is dispatched. proved very recently just how mind-bending the result can be. That Land Rover has not sought out anything as boastful as ‘G-Turn’ (the capacity to spin around within its own length like a tank) does not mean that it has been sparing with its ingenuity. New Range Rovers typically arrive with a slew of patents pending and the Electric is no different. The manufacturer claims it has filed more than ever this time around, most of them centred on the in-house designed, double stack battery and the dual electric motors, though it is evidently no less proud of ’Thermassist’, which despite sounding like a British Gas add-on, is said to be the most advanced onboard thermal management system in the world. Which is something your EV flagship absolutely needs if you want it to operate effectively in the same places a diesel-powered Range Rover will happily go. The fact that the Electric looks very much like the diesel model is both a conscious decision stylistically (again, sameness) and testament to the much earlier choice to ensure that the (admittedly roomy) MLA-Flex platform could accommodate a wide range of powertrains. While fitting into the available space between the wheels still required 344 prismatic cells to be jostled into a decidedly chunky 118kWh battery, with its associated control module plonked on top filling the transmission tunnel, the resulting housing is said not to impinge on either interior space or boot capacity. The Electric’s floorpan is adapted to fit, but architecturally speaking it is unchanged above that, and the model will eventually roll down the same Solihull production line as the combustion and hybrid derivatives. Though the battery is not a structural component per se, Land Rover suggests its substantial presence within the platform has resulted in a torsionally stiffer Range Rover, with a lower centre of gravity than the conventional variants. The decision to stick with one 240kW motor per axle, rather than indulging the vogue for tri or even quad motor configurations is attributed to the results that the manufacturer knew would be achievable with open diffs and the sophisticated new software overseeing them, as well as the weight consideration of adding more drive units. Land Rover is still unwilling to attach an official number to the kerbweight in question, although it suggests that it ought not to be dramatically more than a high-spec Range Rover V8. PH will believe that when we see it, though anything shy of three tonnes will be a significant win. Whatever the end figure, a similar amount of power has been chosen to shift it. The Electric’s quoted 550hp might be less than the 615hp available to the current mild-hybrid range-topper, but 627lb ft of torque comfortably exceeds the 553lb ft that doesn’t appear till 1,800rpm in the V8. As you might expect, while delivery is essentially instantaneous, Land Rover subjects it to all manner of measuring and metering in the EV so that it feels appropriate to whatever task is at hand and (ultimately) doesn’t overwhelm the tyres. Confined exclusively to the equivalent of sun-hardened nursery slopes at the Eastnor estate for an afternoon, we got to experience only a fraction of that full potential, although as tasters go, it was an illuminating one. Range Rovers have been wafting imperiously through the woods and waterways of Herefordshire for multiple generations, yet already, and in unfinished prototype format, none surely can have been quite so regal in their capacity for unflustered progress. According to its maker, the Electric’s chassis is basically unchanged in terms of hardware - same four-wheel steer, same twin-chamber air springs, same linkages, same alloy and tyre size choices - and what differences there are in settings can generally be attributed to the increase in mass and the height it is carried. Even these changes were often made so the EV would be better able to mimic what a standard Range Rover does when it is put through the dynamic ringer. An admittedly slow-speed ringer in this case, but adequate to get a sense of how diligent Land Rover has been with making the Electric feel the same, only more so - and the dividend that its buyers can expect to reap should they opt to trade in a combustion model. It seems insufficient to emphasise the quietness or the calmness or the rolling refinement because a petrol-electric hybrid Ranger Rover already ranks very highly across these metrics (and indeed helped inform development of the EV) yet the distance between it and the Electric will ultimately be how the newcomer is measured, and without an engine to integrate or revs to manage, that space seems almost cathedral-like in its ability to apply an ethereal level of hush to proceedings. Granted, the Electric feels cathedral-like in other ways, too: there is a deliberateness to its progress that speaks to its endless balancing of unseen forces in the damping and metering of power, but this isn’t conveyed as inertia or lumbering unwillingness - quite the opposite. If there is an obstacle to seriously challenge the remorseless, traction-finding creep of the adapted Terrain Response system, then Land Rover didn’t present it to us. It wouldn’t, of course, but the salient point is that any lingering requirement to maintain momentum between gully and steep gradient (previously a crucial component of off-road driving) now seems all but redundant. The Electric doesn’t bulldoze or power through improbable hazards, it inches inexorably over them like a supercomputer contemplating a chess problem. Much as in the Mercedes G 580, anything as ungainly as wheel slip seems a distant memory. The speed at which the software is able to identify and control such moments has increased 100-fold. In a G-wagen, this level of attentiveness did take a bite from the burly fun of being amongst the birds and bees, but in a Range Rover, where you fully expect to feel invulnerable, the supreme composure seems in keeping with your immediate surroundings. Moreover, the model’s long-running ability to acknowledge its giant, pillowy footprint and yet simultaneously boil its heft down to credible, intuitive control surfaces is taken to new extremes. If there was any pressure or mental strain in controlling a car as large and as complex as the L460 at Eastnor, it is blown into the trees here. The Electric’s capacity for relieving stress is roughly equivalent to taking Valium before bed. Impressive then, ultimately, for a prototype which is clearly not finished. We say that not just for the presence of the big red cut-off button in the centre console, but also for the occasional moment where the Electric could still be felt to juggle its torque vectoring and brake interventions during single pedal driving - and indeed in one brief instance where it decided to give up altogether and await a hard reset. Electric buyers will also have to accept some limitations that cannot be ironed out by further testing: 30mm ground clearance has been sacrificed to the positioning of the battery, and its breakover angle has similarly been reduced by four degrees. Predictably, you will not be able to drive it so far without stopping either (a 300-odd-mile real-world range has been mooted) although it will almost certainly charge at 350kW when you do. Beyond all that, we obviously await the complete picture that is a much lengthier road drive. But Land Rover’s reasoning that an early glimpse of the Electric’s low-speed capabilities would suffice for now is hard to fault: just as it’s hard to imagine that the car’s wonderfully mannered performance at Eastnor wouldn’t seamlessly translate to crawling around a global city. It is precisely that sort of bandwidth - wading implacably through 900mm of water; wading implacably through traffic - that has drawn people to the dealership door for decades. With no lap time to set or noise to emulate or speed record to hit or even (as yet) a genuine rival to pit it against, the chances of someone recoiling from Land Rover’s first-ever EV in horror seem remote to the point of non-existent. But just in case they do, there is no plan to stop selling the V8 alongside. Talk about the luxury of choice. And insult to injury: Jaguar fans must be green with envy."

Still do, in fact, with the Royal Green seen on the (also offered on the Octavia vRS) and Hyper Green for the really brave. The blue of the old Fabia vRS LE was nice, yellow has always hit the mark, and Phoenix Orange has suited every Skoda seen with it. When so many colour charts are so drab, some variety is welcome - and now there are more to choose from. Following a public poll on X and Instagram, Space Violet and Water World Green are now available to order on . The purple attracted 43 per cent of the popular vote on X, and a third of Insta users said the new green was their favourite. So in a true display of people power, they’re now on the configurator, priced from £855. They beat Chilli Red and Plum Blue to the production spots. While only shown in this render for now, it looks like the people made a good choice. Water World has a kind of bottle green vibe to it, which is welcome given so many greens right now are very dark. The purple is akin to BMW’s Thundernight, which even makes a 2 Series look quite good. So hopes will be high for its effect on a vRS wagon, particularly if there is a better set of wheels available than seen here. Skoda says the poll is part of its ‘ongoing engagement with its enthusiastic online community, offering fans opportunities to help shape the brand’s future in fun and meaningful ways.’ The more colours for fast Skodas the better, we’ll say.

However much time and effort is invested, realistically, there will always be some niggle or gripe that keeps it from being absolutely ideal. You live with it, of course, because the cost of repair is completely nonsensical, but it never stops being a small bugbear. The paint on my 160k Compact is good enough, albeit with imperfections that really bother me. Only if I sort those out it’ll make the others look worse, and before I know it we’ll be into respray territory. For a £2k car, so no. Attachment is the problem. These cars have made it this far, by hook or by crook, and it feels like our duty to keep them going that bit longer. Maybe even improve them along the way. They haven’t been abandoned or given up just yet, so they deserve a fresh injection of love and TLC. After all, somebody must have spent the money at some point to get the car here - the only proper thing to do is try your best with it. Otherwise known as spending some more money. Sometimes it’s a daft strategy, though it’s hard not to be presented , freshly MOT’d this week and said to boast a full service history, and not be tempted to continue its story a little longer. After all, the colour combo is fantastic, it seems in fine fettle, there’s at least one Michelin fitted to the 18-inch wheels and S-Types look better now than they ever have. Or we’re getting old. Oh yeah - and it’s £2,995. That’s right, three thousand pounds for one of the great super-saloons of the early '00s. One of the great supercharged Jags of the 21st century, in fact. Maybe it isn’t quite an M5, the Jag, but then the BMWs were never £2,995. And the mileage? 229,000, or just a bit more than 10k a year, every year, for its 22-year life. The MOT history shows fairly consistent use over that time; it’s always about 10,000 or so between tests, rather than a mega year then next to nothing after that. Given the general condition inside and the R’s remit, we’ll assume they were mostly motorway miles. There’s a bit of crinkling in the seat bolster, and the passenger’s door looks a slightly different blue, but come on - supercharged Jaguar V8, 12 months MOT, £2,995. There are some bits and bobs to sort out, fiddly bits highlighted by the test like bushes, bearings and brake lines, but none of the worrying stuff you usually see like tyres down to canvas or brake pads set to expire. The S-Type has all the makings of a great modern classic project for someone with the know-how (or the budget) to bring it back to its best. It’ll never be perfect, of course, though it surely could still be a damn fine old Jag. There really is nothing else like it; no S-Type R close in mileage, no V8 XF close in cost, no contemporary anywhere near on either. For a whole host of reasons, this deserves some love. Who’s feeling courageous?"
760,'A modern homage to an icon' - behold the PPW R33,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-eurocars/a-modern-homage-to-an-icon--behold-the-ppw-r33/50079,Matt Bird,2025-07-16,PistonHeads,"Plenty of Italian supercar classics have had their time in their reimagination, recreation or restomod limelight: Lamborghini , Ferrari mined its considerable heritage for , new Paganis look an awful lot and all manner of companies are endeavouring to . But Alfa Romeo has been absent from that list. Oh sure, Alfaholics will make you a lovely little GT Junior, if nothing more exotic than that. Step forward, then, PPW, - ‘a breathtaking tribute to the legendary 1967 Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale.’ 60 years ago, just 11 roadgoing Tipo 33s were made, which would probably explain why it’s taken a while for a 21st-century celebration to happen - it was always going to take someone really dedicated to get the project off the ground. There will be fewer of those for the Tipo 33, surely, than for something made in greater numbers. But PHer David Hutchinson was that person; he emailed last week to say that his ‘five-year obsession has finally come to fruition’, asked whether we’d be interested in writing about it and also whether it should be at Annual Service next month. You can guess the answers to those questions. Originally this was to be a one-off for David, built with PPW, but now the decision has been made to produce 33 of these incredible machines. The spec sounds as good as the car looks, with almost 400hp provided from the dry-sumped, Ferrari-Maserati 4.2-litre F176 V8; it’ll snort through throttle bodies, because that’s what a '60s 33 had, and drive power to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual. The R33 will weigh 1,000kg dry. Partly it’s so light because it’s so small - the joy of paying homage to a classic means this is less than four metres long. But also that’s attributable to the new chassis, which mirrors the dimensions of the original Alfa but with more modern materials. This is no mere rebody of an existing sports car - the R33 by PPW is a whole new thing. And that’s hugely exciting. The body is handcrafted aluminium ‘complemented by state-of-the-art construction techniques.’ Butterfly doors ought to ensure your ingress and egress is almost as graceful. But no guarantees… Without ABS, traction control or power steering, the R33 is described by its maker as a ‘purist’s dream’; the brakes feature Wilwood calipers, the Gaz dampers are bespoke to this project and there isn’t even any servo for the middle pedal - so best bring your A-game. Which is exactly the point; the R33 celebrates a time when driving was visceral, demanding, and immensely rewarding, an era that many are desperate to create now in an increasingly sanitised and synthetic fast car world. Only this one is road legal with IVA approval, and there’ll be rather more than Alfa ever produced in period. Still not very many, though. There will be 33 R33s, and each will cost from £540,000 plus taxes. This colour is Alfa Rosso Corsa, and you’ll be able to see PPW’s glorious work in person . Perfect time to commission your build, in fact…"
761,"Riding shotgun, Pastrana-style | PH Footnote",https://www.pistonheads.com/features/ph-features/riding-shotgun-pastrana-style--ph-footnote/50083,RacingPete,2025-07-16,PistonHeads,"Back in 1995, I passed my driving test. To celebrate, I took a road trip with some mates to Chatsworth House in a chilly November, all to watch the RAC Rally. The main draw? The L555BAT-plated Subaru Impreza 555 - one of my all-time favourite rally cars. Subaru earned a place in my heart for its commitment to hiring flamboyant, flat-out drivers from McRae to Solberg. When Subaru bowed out of the WRC in 2008, they retreated into a world of SUVs, still around, but quietly humming away in the background. But in the USA, it’s a different story. There, Subaru’s rallying fire was rekindled with the launch of the 2024 Subaru Motorsports WRX Rally car. And leading the charge? None other than Travis Pastrana, a man mentored by Subaru legends like McRae and Burns, and very much cut from the same cloth. So when someone at the Goodwood Festival of Speed asked if I fancied a ride in the navigator’s seat next to Travis on the rally stage, there was only one possible answer. With 320 wild horses waiting under the bonnet, nothing was going to stop me. Travis is the definition of a hard-working professional. Starting in dirt bikes, he’s made his name pulling stunts that defy logic - and sometimes gravity. His skeletal x-ray would probably show equal parts bone and metal. In 2006, he was the first person to land a double backflip on a motocross bike at the X Games - six years after being the first to attempt one. He’s botched base jumps, flipped just about every wheeled machine imaginable, and is currently trying to 360 a car. Crashes? Occupational hazard. Despite this, he’s disarmingly likeable. Humble, upbeat, and endlessly chatty. “I’m a good 10th-place NASCAR driver,” he jokes when I ask about his stint there. “I have to work hard on pavement, especially in rally cars.” The marshals lining us up clearly rate him higher. They all agreed he was the best driver of the weekend. Travis returned the praise with a grin, nudging the car playfully towards the line: “These guys have been great all weekend.” We pull up to the start. Revs build. Travis offers a fist bump… and we’re off - plunging into the shaded woodland stage. “It’s so slippy in here,” he says, as we dive from the sunlit hilltop into the trees. “I’ve never driven on anything quite like this before.” But you wouldn’t know it. We flick through the course with effortless rhythm, handbrake flicks, footwork straight out of a ballet, and a constant narration from Travis: “This bit’s got a little rut on the inside - stops me getting the back out fully,” then into a fast section, “I love this bit - flat out, but clip that inside line and we’re rolling.” Somehow, I’m completely at ease. The sound, the speed, the scenery whipping past - it’s visceral. Then we emerge into daylight for a hairpin around a barrel. “Jump on the horn for the fans, it’s by your foot,” he says, ever the showman. He wants everyone to enjoy it. He’s here to entertain. Moments later, we’re sliding sideways out of a 90-right and it’s over almost too soon. “How hard were you pushing?” I ask him. In typical Pastrana fashion, he shrugs it off: “More sideways than I should be, makes it more fun through here. An F1 driver would probably be quicker - smoother, better grip. But hey, that’s not the point.” Exactly. That’s the essence of Travis and of Subaru at its best. Not chasing the stopwatch, but chasing the thrill. Making people fall in love with rallying again. It’s why, 30 years ago, I drove hundreds of miles to see McRae in that iconic blue Subaru. And why, today, I’d do it all again."
762,Nissan Fairlady Z | PH Private Area,https://www.pistonheads.com/regulars/ph-private-area/nissan-fairlady-z--ph-private-area/50080,Matt Bird,2025-07-17,PistonHeads,"It’s now 20 years since the Nissan 350Z GT4 was launched. Looking back on 2005 now, it was probably a 21st-century high point for the Zed car in the UK. The 350 had launched to widespread acclaim a couple of years earlier - it stood out even in a crowded sector - and then along came the special edition in collaboration with the most famous racing game on the planet. Which was also arguably at its best back then, too. The GT4 brought a little more power, a limited edition build plaque and a new Ultra Yellow paint for those that wanted it. It didn’t change much because it didn’t need to, and the 350Z continued being a roaring success. Car mad kids wanted them, those who could drive loved them, and not long after Nissan brought the R35 GT-R to the world - it feels like a different planet rather than a different decade. Now those kids are grown-up millennials, or those adults might want to relive their younger years, and Nissan has nothing to offer the UK customer. We won’t dwell on that for too long, but when the Supra can make a brief comeback, the MX-5 can soldier on and the Civic Type R enjoy a time as about the best driver’s car for £50,000, it’s sad not to have some Nissan representation. Or rather, it’s sad not to have access to some Nissan representation. Because the Z of course exists in other markets outside of Europe, and it remains no less disappointing a few years down the line not to have it here. Probably it says a lot about the strictness of emissions that the case couldn’t be made. That and the general demand for sports cars - a Supra is cool, for example, but when did you last see one? Anyway, if you are one of those legends who can justify a new-ish two-door sports car right now, is there a treat waiting for you in the PH classifieds - . And it looks absolutely wonderful. It’s easy glancing at the specs to be cynical, and to think of this latest Z34 as a mild rework of the 370 with a new turbo V6. There’s some truth in that - but the fact that the design was absolutely nailed shouldn’t be ignored either. Its identity as a Z car is immediately obvious, with smart retro cues alongside modern flourishes. It’s going to get so much more interest than anything comparable. This one is particularly attention-grabbing with its Rays wheels and Blitz suspension. This is a Japanese import sports car, after all - so naturally it’s modified a bit. White on white with the red leather is a great colour combo, and the stance perfect, so best you like drawing a crowd. And maybe think about rust protection. The asking price for this 7,000-miler (it passed its first MOT first time in March) is £45k. Or about exactly the same as of similar age and mileage might cost. Nine-speed against eight-speed, V6 against straight six, two turbos against one - what a match up it could be…"
763,Renault 4 E-Tech | UK Review,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-driven/renault-4-e-tech--uk-review/50082,Cam Tait,2025-07-17,PistonHeads,"Once in a long while, a car comes along that has such immense appeal that it defies the boundaries of class. The is the absolute master of this, looking just as at home shuttling kids off to school as it does parked up in a quiet Knightsbridge street, as does the Fiat 500, which has been the go-to runabout for all tax brackets for almost 20 years. Now Renault has gone and built what is arguably a classless EV with the , following in Fiat’s footsteps by rebooting its classic hatch for a swarm of new buyers - 84 per cent of whom had never bought a Renault before, while a good chunk were diving into electric ownership for the very first time. So it only makes sense to revisit other models from yestercentury and give them the EV treatment. But, you know, it’s got to be one people remember fondly. No point in reviving the Renault 9. The however, possessed the right mix of cute styling and ruggedness to prove incredibly popular throughout the latter half of the 20th century, with Renault shifting eight million of them between 1961 and 1992. So it’s an ideal candidate for an electric reboot, and that’s exactly what it’s done with the Renault 4 E-Tech that we have here. Well, sort of. See, the Renault 5 closely follows the original formula by being a small hatchback, albeit with an electric motor and proper safety gear. To prevent the R4 from stepping on the R5’s toes, Renault’s reimagined it as a compact crossover, which makes sense in the fact that a) the original car was famed for its hardiness and b) crossovers still reign supreme in the sales charts, so whacking some plastic cladding down the sides and raising the ride height does make quite a lot of sense. True, that does mean it loses the old car’s sit-up-and-beg silhouette, nose hunkered down with its backside in the air, but Renault’s otherwise managed to cram the R4 full of nods to the past. The circular headlights are among them, and they’re hidden within a black visor that follows the look of the original’s grille. The ripples at the base of the door, meanwhile, are a modern spin on the old model’s plastic protectors, and the rear is mostly flat and slopes downwards for that bread van-like appeal. It looks good, especially in one of the pastel colours, but it’s missing some of the magic that made the electric 5 so magnetic. The optional retractable fabric roof, which will be available from summer 2026, should bring a dash more character, which is probably all that's needed for parity with the affable cinq. Speaking of the R5, the R4 is based on the same AmpR platform as the hatchback. Being the workhorse of the range means Renault has stretched the wheelbase to 2,624mm, around 84mm longer than the R5, while the height is up by 72mm to 1,570mm, all of which aims to open up interior space so five occupants can comfortably fit in. Now, being a family of two does make testing the 4’s practicality a little tricky, but then I got a call from my brother who’d had a few drinks at the beach and needed me to give him, my brother-in-law and nephew a lift home. All fit in the back row just fine, with no complaints about space. Okay, so it’s a little tight on legroom if you’re over six foot, as my brother is, but not to the point where it becomes uncomfortable. The Renault 4 comes with a decent amount of boot space, too. At 420 litres, the 4 trumps the Fiat 600e and , though the Citroën ë-C3 Aircross and Ford Puma Gen-E are more cavernous. Still, there’s 55 litres of storage space underneath the boot floor for things like charging cables, and you can drop the rear seats for 1,405 litres of storage space. What’s more, you can fold the front passenger seat flat for, I dunno, book shelves or cupboards or skis. The boot floor is also incredibly low, meaning lifting stuff in and out requires minimum effort, and the whole car’s littered with cubbies and elastic belts so you can put stuff away and forget about it until your PCP deal comes to an end. Being a stretched Renault 5 means you not only get an identical dash layout, but also the same 52kWh battery as the range-topping hatchback (we’re not taking the 40kWh battery here in the UK), which has a claimed range of up to 247 miles. Driving this in the middle of a heatwave meant I had near-perfect conditions for the battery, with 240-ish miles displayed when all juiced up. Driving between my home in Berkshire and Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex could easily be done on a single charge, air con blasting all the way, with an average power consumption of comfortably north of four miles per kWh is seriously impressive, especially for a car with such boxy proportions. Charging up, however, is still a hassle if you don’t happen to have a driveway or a convenient on-street charger. I have the latter, but it’s used so little and isn’t especially well signposted that there are always non-electric cars parked in front of it. Not wanting to be that person who leaves notes on windscreens, I was forced to use public charges in and around the area, which was easy enough, although the cost to top up is just silly. That’s nothing to do with the R4, of course, and being compatible with 100kW charges means it’ll go from 15-80 per cent in 30 minutes, which is just enough time for a coffee break on a long journey, but you really need a home solution in place before committing. Anyway, it’s quick to charge and doesn't burn its electrons all at once, but is it any good to drive? Unsparingly, yes. It’s a Renault 5 underneath, after all, which has not only been lauded here on PH but across the board as well. Naturally, the taller ride height means there’s a hint more roll in the corners, but it otherwise steers with a good (and surprising) amount of weight and glides over rough surfaces in a way very few electric cars can. That’s partly down to the 4 being a bit of a lightweight, especially for an EV. At 1,462kg, it’s only a smidgen heavier than the R5 and a good deal lighter than the aforementioned ë-C3 Aircross, Puma Gen-E and Fiat 600e. It also doesn’t have stupidly big wheels, with my range-topping ‘Iconic’ model equipped with 18-inch rims wrapped in densely-sidewalled rubber. Straight-line performance won’t set your trousers on fire, because there’s only 150hp and 180lb ft of torque to play with, but it’s enough to get you to 62mph from a standstill in 8.2 seconds. If anything, it’s refreshing to drive an EV that isn’t trying to constantly rip your face off. You’ll need to be in either comfort, sport or perso (Renault speak for individual) driving modes to get everything the motor’s got to give, mind. While it’s tempting to drive about in eco, performance is significantly reduced and a 72mph speed limit is put in place. Not that you’d have any need to go any faster, to any police folk reading this, and you can temporarily disable the limit by pressing the accelerator all the way to the floor, where you’ll feel a slight ‘click’ and a sudden swell of power, but that in turn flings passengers to the backs of their seats. And when you’re constantly overtaking slow-moving traffic doing 69mph, it tends to get a little wearing for all involved. Of course, it’s absolutely brimming with autonomous safety systems that, thankfully, never interfere with the job of driving. Words I never thought I’d write. Even better, you can assign all of them to a button located just to the right of the steering wheel. With a double press, all the systems you want off will instantly return to their box. You’ll need to do so every time you start the car up, and you can thank the bureaucrats for that, not Renault, but it boggles the mind that more manufacturers don’t offer such a solution, because it makes modern motoring a lot more bearable. Even digging through the (wonderfully simple) menus is a doddle, courtesy of a Google-powered infotainment system that’s got enough processing grunt to feel slick and speedy. Then there’s the price, which starts at £26,995 and tops out at £30,995. That puts it on par with a hybrid , and undercuts a good chunk of the competition, too. The only downside here is that heated seats are reserved for top spec models, and you can’t option them in a lower grade, either, which is a bit of a let-down. Otherwise, Renault’s gone and hit the ball out of the park again. While it’s not quite as charming as the R5, it’s a darn sight more characterful than the majority of B-segment crossovers on sale. Most of which I can’t even picture, let alone name. But the R4 is here to make the cheap family runabout fun again, and it does just that with flying tricolors."
764,Why tyre markings matter | PH Explains,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/general-pistonheads/why-tyre-markings-matter--ph-explains/50091,Sponsored,2025-07-17,PistonHeads,"No matter your budget, renewing all four tyres on your car can often feel like a chore. It’s the most crucial component of the lot - the only one connecting your pride and joy to the road - yet the bills it accrues are enough to make anyone wince. Time to pose the big question, then: just how crucial is it to keep your car replenished with the specific tyre designed for it? “Tyre labelling grades are key in informing drivers about three key performance characteristics of a car and van tyre: wet grip, fuel efficiency and external noise,” says Michelin. “Nearly all new car and van tyres are tested to EU standards and given a grade in relation to performance. These grades are then displayed on new tyres with a label and can also be found in the EPREL (European Product Registry for Energy Labelling) database. Regulators can spot-check results, ensuring the label gives you a quick, trustworthy snapshot of performance.” Which also means the * on the sidewalls of your BMW or the N stamped into your Porsche tyres are no mere gimmicks. “There is a long history of collaboration between Porsche and Michelin. In that time, our engineers have been able to develop tailormade tyres using special rubber compounds and custom-fit geometry developed for each specific model. Fitting tyres that aren’t N-marked may alter some performance characteristics, the Porsche engineers originally wanted you to feel. “Equally, the * (star) marking means the tyre was jointly designed by the tyre manufacturer and BMW, meaning it has been developed and tested to ensure you enjoy the steering, grip and comfort BMW intended even years later. “Vehicle manufacturers often work with tyre manufacturers to design and engineer tyres specifically for their models, taking into account transmission systems and other key components. If you wish to change to tyres that aren’t OEM approved, a suggestion would be to fit four identical tyres – but it is equally important to check with your vehicle manufacturer or local tyre professional whether those tyres are suitable for your vehicle.” You should take heed of any XL (Extra Load) markings on your original tyres come replacement, too. “XL tyres are reinforced and are often recommended by manufacturers to carry heavier loads. If your vehicle weight does not require XL tyres, then there may be no additional benefit to using them.” Which brings us to a pertinent question. Just how much pressure has the rising mass of SUVs, EVs and their frequent combination piled on the rubber below? “Car technology is changing, largely due to the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles,” says Michelin. “Improvements to their range often mean a larger and heavier battery. The Tyre Manufacturer Association and ETRTO (European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation) have defined a new High Load capacity tyre. They use the same pressures but offer a higher load-carrying capacity. HL will be marked before the dimension – HL 265/35 ZR20, for example, and if your original tyres are HL-marked you should continue to replace them with HL tyres. Like XL-marked tyres, if your vehicle manufacturer hasn’t opted for HL tyres from the factory, you don’t need to consider them.” Given how carefully OEM fitment respects – indeed, elevates – the handling nuances of a car, should we be concerned that most cars sold in the UK are done so wearing so-called summer tyres, when inclement British weather often reduces the traction below us for large portions of the year? “Vehicle manufacturers typically pick the tyre that best matches each model’s priorities such as ride comfort, braking performance, tyre longevity, responsive handling or rolling resistance.” says Michelin. “Depending on these priorities, summer tyres may be favoured to achieve some of these performance characteristics; however, some vehicle makers already sign off both summer and winter options, while more are now approving all-season choices such as Michelin’s CrossClimate from the factory. “In the replacement market, the shift is even clearer: all-season tyres such as the CrossClimate 2 are gaining popularity as drivers look for a set that can handle Britain’s mixed weather all year round.” Tyre pressures are something PistonHeads readers likely consider more than most drivers, and they ought to be front of mind if you’ve opted to switch your car from its tyres’ factory dimensions. “We would always recommend following the suggested pressures from the vehicle manufacturer unless a tyre professional has advised otherwise,” says Michelin. “The vehicle manufacturer often sets inflation pressures based on its own understanding of its models’ load carrying capabilities and performance criteria. If you change a vehicle’s tyre dimensions, you may need to change the pressures used. “Your best bet is to check with the vehicle manufacturer to ensure your new dimension is compatible and to check if there are suggested pressures available. If this is a bespoke conversion, it’s important to understand the load the vehicle is carrying before any suggestion can be made. If you want a specific tyre pressure recommendation or to chat about tyres, you can .” Plenty of us own track specials or classics which only roll out of the garage occasionally, requiring a cautious eye despite their relatively low mileage. “Tyres are safety kit, so each one sold here must meet stringent construction and use regulations before it hits the road,” says Michelin. “But rubber ages: heat, cold, sunlight, storage and usage can all speed up or slow down the aging process. It’s important to check your tyre pressures regularly and look for signs of wear and damage. If you are unsure on what to look for, then it is important to consult a professional who will be able to advise on their condition."" For those of us with the dinkiest track toys and classics, hunting down appropriately sized tyres is no longer as simple as it used to be. “Michelin still produces 13” to 15” dimensions in limited sizes and will continue to do so for as long as there is a demand,” we’re assured. ""Please check out our website or our Classic tyre range to see if your dimension is .” Sensible questions covered off, then, let’s round off with something we’ve surely all wondered but never dared voice: why are all tyres black, not least when concept cars have frequently promised us a more technicolour route to grip and stability? “Over 200 ingredients go into making a tyre that each play a vital role in its characteristics. Natural rubber forms the main component of the tread layers, while carbon black and silica are used as reinforcing agents to improve durability. Carbon black is a key ingredient in tyre production, in fact, and not just for its colour. It increases tyres’ resistance to wear by protecting against UV (ultraviolet) light damage. So, no rainbow tyres just yet sadly.”"
765,Porsche 911 GT3 (992.2) | UK Review,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-driven/porsche-911-gt3-992-2--uk-review/50084,Matt Bird,2025-07-17,PistonHeads,"Perhaps more than ever, it’s easy to be cynical about the . The greater personalisation scope for the 992.2 (at the request of customers) doesn’t feel very motorsporty - neither does having four seats as a no-cost option - and to see a £200k RRP attached to this green one is mind-boggling. But then £45k of extras will do that to a list price. The last one had 510hp, as does this one, so the money for old rope arguments surely won’t be far behind. For those who sing head, shoulders, heel and toe to their kids (start them young and all that), this GT3 seems like marketing has had more of a say than motorsport. Just get an already exceptional old one, if you must, or for 80 per cent of the experience - or simply have something else entirely. Social media hasn’t helped, of course. Sometimes it can seem like the main appeal of a GT3 in the 2020s is not, y’know, a 9,000rpm manual 911, but having that PTS colour nobody else has or never-before-seen contrast stitching. Then moving it on when the next interesting thing comes along. There are 33 992.1 GT3s on PH right now, and three with more than 10,000 miles. But folk not using their 911s enough is categorically not a problem with the car. And greater availability ought to be a good thing if it means more people get access to GT department wizardry. Certainly it doesn’t take long for the charm offensive of an Oak Green Touring to take hold; the front end is smarter than the slightly gawky visage of the first 992, the optional carbon roof is fun to tap and the magnesium wheels look utterly glorious. It’ll probably seem even more incredible with the right filter on it. Even with wingless GT3s having now existed since 2017 (and it was hardly a great innovation then, let’s be honest), there remains something very special about the road racer attitude and relatively unassuming silhouette. Seeing four seats in a GT3 is bizarre, that’s for sure. As with all 911s, they’re hardly going to be regular pews for anyone; it might be nice to show the next generation what an engine really ought to sound like, if they’re interested. Equally, there’s no obligation to get the no-cost option for those who want a GT car as pure as possible. The Lightweight Pack seats are - you’ve guessed it - just about perfect, clasping in all the right locations and placing all your limbs at the right angle of attack. The interior of this test car perhaps seems a tad dour, though what is an extended options list for if not jazzing up a driving environment? A GT3 gearlever has never felt too long, right up until shunting the shorter item around - it’s a joy. Indeed, you’ll be full of childish enthusiasm (and feeling that cynicism ebb away all too easily) before moving an inch. The 4.0-litre still chunters and whirrs and fizzes at idle, responding eagerly to any extra millimetre of throttle, and the travel of the six-speed feels akin to a sequential. You’ll flick it around the gate like it’s the first time you tried a manual, just for the fun of it. For something often perceived as quite serious, the GT3 is actually very much a ‘for the fun of it’ kinda car. The gearshift is perfectly defined, the clutch perfectly weighted, meaning you really will grab a ratio for the heck of it - and how many cars does that still apply to? The symphony of sounds emitted by the flat-six are all divine, so it’s just a matter of choosing which you’d prefer on the six-speed multichanger. You’ll carry on around roundabouts once more just to feel how alert and secure the chassis is. That joy of newer GT3s, where there’s the engagement that eludes lesser 911s without the needy demand of Mezger-engined cars, is certainly present here. The steering changes for the second-gen 992 have conferred an extra willingness to the front end and just a tad more life to the wheel, so at any speed the experience is more satisfying. Needless to say, the brake pedal is one of the best out there. And the suspension somehow keeps the car incredibly stiff and level with what feels like an impossible amount of travel, so there’s no sacrifice. Predictably, a GT3 is not at its happiest pootling around town, and most definitely not with the dampers in Track, but that’s missing the point. It can pose if needed, though it never necessarily feels like it wants to. The gearing changes probably have the biggest influence on the feel of this car now. An eight per cent shorter final drive, ostensibly to address a shortfall in torque (four cats now have contributed to a fall from 347lb ft to 332), has injected extra vim into what was already an effervescent, thrilling powertrain: it doesn’t matter if you shift at 4,000rpm or twice that, the next gear feels more willing to do it all over again than in any previous GT3. The rush is completely addictive, racing through the revs time after time. And that doesn’t have to mean the limiter; the heightened sense of acceleration (and exhilaration) ensures that even getting to fourth by 60mph feels special. If only more new-to-buy cars could be the same. So a GT3 is beguiling company at everyday commitment levels. But given that chance to extend it just a little bit further and you'll discover the stand-out, sensational 911 all over again. Peak power at 8,500rpm with that revised gearing and a feral shriek from the exhaust compels you to repeat the process indefinitely. Blipping back down the gears is almost as gratifying as accelerating up them, because every interface offers up just the right feel and resistance. Which sounds so basic, yet is so seldom achieved elsewhere. The composure under braking, the precision of the steering and the flawlessness of the body control keeps you coming back for more, on repeat. It’s race car immediacy for the road, without the intimidation. So you don’t stop driving, ideally ever. The size feels alright these days, especially with a thrill to rival mid-engined exotica, the gearbox always keeps you occupied, and the power and torque mean opportunities to extend a GT3 denied to 800hp hybrids. The digital rev counter was thought about only now, truth be told - the change doesn’t matter. Shock, it’s another great 911 GT3. As absorbing or as agreeable as required, all the time, every time. Granted, yes, the last car offered much the same pay-off, and they aren’t £200,000. The GT3 before that offered what is still the best-looking Touring there’s been, too. And it’s hardly like a Mezger GT3 is anything short of exceptional. There’s always a reasoned, pragmatic reason not to have the newest 9,000rpm 911. But in a world seemingly allergic to manual gearboxes and natural aspiration and usable dimensions (certainly at less than seven figures), the GT3 might well be more persuasive than it ever has been.

766,"JLR confirms job losses, delays Range Rover EV",https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-britishcars/jlr-confirms-job-losses-delays-range-rover-ev/50085,Matt Bird,2025-07-18,PistonHeads,"Amid a drop in global sales of around 11 per cent, JLR has confirmed a round of voluntary redundancies for the business. It’s expected that no more than 500 roles will be lost, or 1.5 per cent of the UK workforce according to the manufacturer. They’re all in a management capacity, rather than production-based. “JLR regularly offers eligible employees voluntary redundancy programmes. Through this limited UK VR programme for managers, JLR is aligning its leadership workforce for the business’s current and future needs,"" it said in a statement. The current turmoil of US politics is partly to blame, you’ll not be surprised to learn. While the end of production for combustion-engined Jaguars will also have contributed to a downturn, it feels less important than what's being levied on sales across the Atlantic. Trump may have relaxed his tariff policy for the UK, but it remains an additional tax on an expensive luxury good. Given the capricious nature of this current US administration, it’s understandable that some may be putting off a purchase in the hope of the strategy being changed again. With the US being JLR's biggest market, the ripple effects of any upheaval are inevitable. Whether or not that also accounts for a decision to delay the forthcoming Range Rover Electric is open to interpretation. Land Rover has apparently confirmed to customers on its wait list that the car will not launch now till next year. Suggestions that this might be due to a lack of demand hardly ring true when there were said to be 64,000 names on that list, although clearly the model still required more development work when this month. At any rate, the manufacturer hasn’t been confirmed yet at which facilities the redundancies will take effect, or exactly when they will be implemented. The official statement concluded: “We are grateful to the Government for delivering at speed the new UK-US trade deal, which gives us the confidence to invest £3.5bn per annum to realise our strategy which is delivering."" Speaking of strategy, there is also additional speculation that JLR's current predicament may have affected the timeline for Jaguar's high-profile relaunch - although given the firm's reticence in setting a specific date for the launch of the Type 00, there is no way to know for sure if that is accurate or not. A company spokesperson reiterated: ""By 2030 JLR will sell electric versions of all its luxury brands. Our plans and vehicle architectures are flexible so we can adapt to different market and client demands."""
767,Skoda Octavia vRS estate | Shed of the Week,https://www.pistonheads.com/regulars/ph-features-sheds/skoda-octavia-vrs-estate--shed-of-the-week/50087,Tony Middlehurst,2025-07-18,PistonHeads,"Shed likes a big, powerful load carrier. That was actually one of his main reasons for marrying Mrs Shed. Unfortunately she had other ideas about that so he’s been pretty much carrying the can, or cans when they’re at the supermarket, ever since. Still, a speedy wagon to help him in his dolorous load-lugging duties will always turn Shed’s eye. This week’s sub-£2k with a valid MOT contestant very much ticks that box. It’s a smart example of Skoda’s Octavia vRS estate powered by VAG’s lively (187hp at 5,100-6,000rpm), torquey (207lb ft at 1,800-5,000rpm) and generally well-regarded 2.0 TFSI engine. The Octavia estate body added a smidgeon to the hatch’s 0-62mph time but it would still chase that target down in just 7.5 seconds. Not bad for a car that would easily, not to say miraculously for something based on a Golf platform, swallow up five adults plus all their gear and bowl them along the autobahn at 148mph and pull hard from low revs in every gear. You had to put some of that sprightliness down to the gen-two Octavia estate’s weight of 1,415kg, a figure that seems ludicrously low now that we’ve all become accustomed to two-tonne EVs. Eeeh, where did we go wrong, bring on the lightweight batteries, grumble moan etc. Our shed has done 129,000 miles, which isn’t a lot for one of these and its Race Blue paint still looks fresh. The most recent MOT test in June came out squeaky clean and the worst advisories you’ll see in the rest of the MOT history will be for worn tyres or suspension bushes. A non-excessive oil leak was noted in 2018 but that hasn’t shown up since. A slightly blowing exhaust first reported in 2019 was put right in 2021. That’s more or less it on the bad news front – if you can reasonably call any of this stuff bad news. The CO2 is 187g/km. According to the bit of paper (bearing many angry crossing-outs) that’s Blu-Tacked to the side of Shed’s Amstrad, that means an annual vehicle excise duty bill of £385. That’s less than half what it would have been only a little bit further up the VED table. There’s more good news at the pumps with the official mid-30s mpg average being easily bettered on a cruise and hard to get below even when you’re ragging it. Remaps to 250hp were simple and joyful. At heart these are good strong cars but possibly as a result of cost-cutting during this era there are a fair few bits that can go wrong, owners reporting porous wheels (not everyone was a big fan of the 18in ones), failed fuel pumps, PCCV valves, ABS sensors and air con condensers/actuators, and draining batteries which probably didn’t do much to fend off various other electrical maladies like forgetful ECUs and satnavs, malfunctioning mirrors and wonky wipers. Some cars exposed to harsher weather such as that typically found in places like Scot Land suffered from body rot, and there was no getting away from the fact that they all chomped through consumables as enthusiastically as Mrs Shed rips through a Sunday carvery. As the postmistress will confirm, Shed enjoys a quick delve every now and then. He likes to believe that his investigations into past examples of SOTW-featured cars give us a clue as to how long the one he’s writing about now might last. Of course in reality they do no such thing but he’s getting on a bit so let’s humour him. There have been a couple of vRS Octavias on here in the last 18 months. The most recent was another Race Blue car, a from late 2008 that was whipped off the shelves before Shed’s posted-in copy managed to get online in February of this year. It’s too early to know that particular car’s fate as its MOT doesn’t run out until December, but the from late 2023 is another story. That was another handsome specimen even with the 155,000 miles that would have been on the clock at around the time of Shed’s write-up. A couple of months after that it was given a clean MOT pass after an initial fail for one over-tired tyre. Sadly that was to be its last test. Who knows what happened there, but it’s not the first time this sort of thing has happened where apparently solid high-performance SOTW cars disappear off our roads within a year of them being picked up for buttons. Could it be that people stop valuing nice things when they’re cheap? A few years back Shed had an open day where you could pitch up at his workshop and have any fault fixed for free. He thought it would create lots more business going forward, but he never did it again because none of those new customers ever came back, which he thought was very ungrateful. The local plod thought there might have been some connection between the zero customer return rate and the mysterious disappearance of some hard to get parts from many of these cars, or perhaps with the fact that none of them were ever seen again in a functioning state, but thanks to some interesting inside info on that bobby that Shed was given by the postmistress no cases were ever brought."
768,Techart launches latest 992.2 performance upgrades,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-germancars/techart-launches-latest-992-2-performance-upgrades/50089,Matt Bird,2025-07-18,PistonHeads,"While modifying a car as new and as capable as a Porsche 911 looks unnecessary, there’s no denying the demand exists. Look , for example, turbocharging throughout the range now making power gains more easily achieved than ever. Techart is keen to take full advantage of the fact, with a range of performance kits already launched for the 992.2 era of 911. Specifically, it has packages for the (including 4 and ) plus the . The former is arguably of most interest, for the simple fact that it adds so much more power with so relatively little changed for the flat six. The 3.0-litre turbo gets what Techart calls its ‘Techtronic’ engine control unit, a new bracket for it, and a Techart wiring harness; with that lot installed, a new 992 Carrera is now 111hp more potent, with peak power at 505hp rather than 394hp. In other words, It’s more than a 25 per cent uplift with just electronic witchcraft. Which isn’t to dismiss Techart’s work, of course; indeed, it assures us that Techntronic ‘ensures seamless integration, full diagnostics compatibility and installation without modifications to the vehicle’s standard electronics.’ It’s compatible with a GPF, too. Just imagine where the engine might get to with hardware changes… The impact on performance is predictably profound, especially with a 59lb ft uplift as well (for 391lb ft). A Porsche that could reach 62mph in 4.1 seconds and twice that in 14.4 seconds is now capable of a 3.4-second dash to 62mph and 0-124mph in less than 10 seconds - 9.7, to be precise, almost five seconds off stock. It sounds like an absolute monster of a Carrera, the Techart car. And imagine the 505hp with a manual. Techart says the new modification offers ‘powerful extra power with full everyday usability’. No beating powerful extra power. For the GTS, the same methods are applied to slightly less drastic effect (perhaps as the 3.0-litre has two turbos to fettle, the 3.6 hybrid unit just one). Nevertheless, Techtronic takes the GTS to 601hp from 541, as well as adding a meaningful 81lb ft. So while it only takes a couple of tenths from the benchmark sprints, a Techarted T-Hybrid is likely to feel even more muscular than the already stacked standard car. Techart hasn’t released any pricing yet for its latest work. On the one hand, tinkering with Porsches is never cheap work (take it from someone merely trying to breathe life back into an old Boxster); on the other, the power kit doesn’t exactly comprise a raft of changes. So hopefully it’s not prohibitive. Certainly this modestly specced could surprise plenty of folk with more than 500hp; or, for those that want to make more of an impact, how about ?"
769,New Subaru Uncharted signals UK model blitz,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-japanesecars/new-subaru-uncharted-signals-uk-model-blitz/50090,Matt Bird,2025-07-18,PistonHeads,"Everyone likes a Subaru Outback. It’s just one of those cars: hardy, dependable, unassuming and very desirable to the right kind of person. Many have followed the Outback style over the years, with various Allroads, All-Terrains, Alltracks, Scouts and so on, but only one has endured 30 years without straying too far from the original formula. There’s the utility and practicality of an estate, with as much off-road ability as anyone who doesn’t own land will ever need. The latest one appears to offer more of the same, albeit with one key twist - it’s now battery-powered. Subaru’s boxer engines were facing an uphill battle against legislation - the current 2.5 is just 169hp strong in an Outback - and the instant torque of an EV powertrain will surely be especially useful given an Outback’s remit. So this bold new wagon is the E-Outback; shown only as a blue Trailseeker for the moment (the mechanically identical one sold in the US), it’s perhaps the most drastically different Outback in 30 years. Under the fresh new look is a 74.7kWh battery that should offer, by Subaru’s estimate, more than 279 miles of range. There’s also the scope to reach 62mph in 4.4 seconds, a totally different performance plane to any previous Outback. Just as importantly, the all-wheel drive remains symmetrical (we’d assume with dual motors), there’s 210mm of ground clearance, plus 1,500kg of towing capacity. Additionally, Subaru has kept the Outback usefully large. It reckons four suitcases can go in the boot - or ‘all the equipment for your next adventure’ - while also offering all the safety kit that’s now required in a new car. Though UK pricing for the E-Outback hasn’t been announced yet, it’s coming next summer - definitely one to keep an eye on. Just the other day we were talking about how there aren’t enough EV estates around… The E-Outback forms part of a wider EV refresh for Subaru in Europe. The Solterra, the joint project with Toyota that also created the bZ4X and which hasn’t really hit the mark yet, now benefits from what Subaru is calling ‘significant hardware and software upgrades’ alongside a styling refresh to help it stand out in a crowded SUV sector. Most importantly, it now goes further and faster; a new 73.1kWh battery means more than 310 miles on a charge (it was 289 previously), and the dual motor setup is now much more potent, with 344hp against the old 215. So the 0-62mph is reduced by almost two seconds to 5.1. The Solterra charges quicker, too, for the holy trinity of EV improvements; 10 to 80 per cent takes half an hour (Subaru hasn’t said what that is as a DC figure), and it can even do that at minus 10. Towing capacity - an EV SUV Subaru is still a Subaru, after all - has now doubled to 1,500kg. Three years on from launch, this is probably the Solterra it should have always been - it’s arriving here early in ‘26. At the same time, Subaru will bring a new model called the Uncharted to the UK. It’s the company’s first small electric SUV, offering both front- and four-wheel drive configurations. Subaru says it’s a car for ‘outdoor-loving explorers and performance enthusiasts alike’; to that end, it has the same ground clearance and towing capacity as the E-Outback , while also offering up the Solterra’s dual-motor arrangement for those that want it. That means 0-62mph in just five seconds and 292 miles of range. Interestingly, too, the big battery that powers that flagship model will also be offered in a single-motor, long-range, front-drive version of the Uncharted. That should mean 363 miles from a tank, as well as ‘Subaru’s world-leading expertise in traction and stability control tuning’ for a decent amount of all-terrain ability. There will also be a front-drive Uncharted with a 57.7kWh battery for 276 miles of range. Covering all the bases then, by the sounds of it - there’s even a 14-inch infotainment screen in the SUVs, to ensure all the electric family car boxes are ticked. Hopefully, however, not all of the old Subaru quirkiness has been lost, however conventional most of the new models appear: ‘Adding these three models to its current line-up, Subaru will continue to deliver and intends to keep on delivering the promise of enjoyment and peace of mind to car enthusiasts and born-ready explorers alike, ensuring they stay driven by what they love.’ Long may it continue. And put us first in the queue for an E-Outback,  please…"
770,"School holiday heroes, PH-style | Six of the Best",https://www.pistonheads.com/features/ph-six-of-the-best/school-holiday-heroes-ph-style--six-of-the-best/50094,PH Staff,2025-07-19,PistonHeads,"Anyone with kids will be more than a little anxious about the next few weeks; if it isn’t already, it’s school holiday time. Which means at least six weeks of worrying just a little more about what they’re up to all day - and, of course, planning a family getaway to the seaside. It’s tradition, after all, and tradition dictates that you go to the seaside in a sensible saloon and everyone has a jolly splendid time. When we were kids, that would invariably have been in something naff, but that doesn’t have to be the case any longer - even if sandcastles and amusements are still on the agenda. This MG ZS 180 is an ideal example of what we're talking about; the kids will be fascinated by winding up windows and choosing the next CD, while you get the entertainment of the KV6 and a fine front-drive chassis. Just think of all that space under the spoiler, too. For those after something subtler, safer and speedier - not to say even cheaper - than the MG, could do a whole lot worse than a 9-5 Aero. Everyone is going to be comfy in Saab seats when it comes to a nap on the way home, those up front have the benefit of heated chairs, and there’s no danger of this attracting any unwanted attention on the promenade. Unlike, um, some others on this list. There isn’t even an Aero badge on this one. But there is a manual gearbox, which is nice to find on these 250hp flagships, and an advisory free MOT that runs all the way through summer, autumn, and into 2026. There’s not very much else said about it in the ad, but as tends to be Saab tradition it presents pretty nicely. Nothing a polish and some leather feed couldn’t sort, that’s for sure. Next thing you know it’ll be at a classic car show on the way home… We’ve probably all been to the caravan for a week in a Cortina, Sierra or Mondeo of some kind. The car was likely slow and dreary, but you remember the experience vividly because weeks away from home are exciting when you’re seven and haven’t had to plan it. How different things might have been in a Sierra Cossie; 35 years ago it would have felt like your dad was a superhero. These days the kids would probably rather take a cab to the beach so they can plug their phone in. Even if it does look acceptably spacious back there, and the Sierra has electric rear windows - take that, MG. This isn’t just any Cossie, either, but the Rouse Sport modified 304-R - a true connoisseur’s special that nobody else will know anything about. Just how we like it. Bidding opens on Tuesday, so it could be yours by August. Make sure the staycation is a good drive away… The only carmaker who could claim to have conveyed as many families around the UK as Ford is Vauxhall, its bitter rival for the nation’s affections. The pitch battle was a fever pitch when the Insignia was introduced to lever buyers from the Mondeo. What it lacked in ‘Feel the difference’ quality, the Vauxhall made up for with brute force - a ploy it repeated over and over in VXR colours. The Aussie-built turbocharged 2.8-litre V6 delivered 325hp to all four wheels via a Haldex AWD system. Subtle it was not. But it was plenty fast enough for most and it has inevitably gone from being vaguely affordable when new to dirt cheap now. Under £10k buys you a decently kept, average miles example like this one. A different sort of timewarp to the Sierra, but one that will seem no less wistful before very long. Of course, if you find three-box European cars about as interesting as packing peanuts, then there is always the vast melting pot that is the JDM. Options abound: envy the child who is retrieved from the school gates in a WRX or Evo. What better way to make fond memories? Or you could go deeper still and buy something like this HR-34 GT - a car that answers the question what an R34 GT-R would look like if you installed some family-friendly back doors. Granted, you won’t get quite the same quota of white-knuckle performance (this version getting a much more humble 2.0-litre lump) but you’re sure to turn heads like a topless supermodel. This one has been in the country since 2019, and a few bumps and scrapes aside, appears to be in decent nick. Bidding begins next Wednesday. If you’ve got a bit more budget to play with, the options go from left field to a place right at the farmer’s table. Given a full run of the classifieds, a Giulia QF - - ticks all sorts of boxes, not least the one devoted to entertaining the child inside you. But there are few experiences that come close to the regal pleasure of sweeping up and down the country in a V12-powered Aston Martin, especially one as pretty as the Rapide. That you can have one for VW Golf money is one of the abiding quirks of the secondhand market, although obviously you’ll be wanting a backup fund for upkeep and fuel - and the rear isn’t quite as spacious as you might think. But what better way to prove to the kids that the start of the 21st century, with all its rapacious silliness, had way more pomp and circumstance than the next bit to come."
771,"2025 Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid | UK Review",https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-driven/2025-porsche-panamera-turbo-s-e-hybrid--uk-review/50096,Matt Bird,2025-07-19,PistonHeads,"First-world problems don’t come much less pressing than the slow demise of the V8 super-saloon. But for those of us who love the genre, it’s more than a little disheartening. Maserati has made its last , the 5.0-litre Jaguars are long gone, the Alpinas aren’t far behind, and Audi… well, who knows? We're promised another RS6, but hurry up already. Having as recently as the last generation offered a 540i beneath , BMW only now sells below the flagship; Mercedes will sell you a V8 saloon, believe it or not, but it must be . range is now V8 only, granted, though that feels like a slightly different kind of realm. Thank goodness, then, that powerfully built company directors across the land have Porsche to call upon; it has three V8 Panameras in the line-up now. There’s , with just the 4.0-litre twin-turbo; that’s then given to 680hp for the Turbo. And then there’s this, for when only 200mph or more will do: . It operates, really, in a space all on its own; tens of thousands more than an M5, another £50k on top of a GTS. An S-Class is comparable in power, if not really remit, and is a £200,000 car before a single option. As tested, this is more than twice the price of an unoptioned saloon. So there surely won’t be very many Turbo S E-Hybrids sold; on paper, it’s little quicker than a Turbo for £25k more. But much like the 12-cylinder saloons of yesteryear, it’s impossible not to be intrigued by the car at the top of the pyramid. It’s a Panamera with a V8 and basically twice the power of a 911 Carrera. Curious? You're not alone. The upgrade from Turbo to S is more significant than usual Competition or Plus spec of a flippin' fast four-door. While the E-Hybrid battery and motor are unchanged (21.9kWh usable, 190hp), this Panamera gets a revised version of the V8 for 600hp - up from 511hp in the Turbo. As well as making it the only Panamera with 200mph potential, it also means 0-62mph is possible in less than three seconds. And speed does matter, let’s not forget. Probably a 600hp Panamera Turbo S would be very nice without the assistance of a battery. But let's not get bogged down in that discussion. Furthermore, once you’ve experienced how well the V8 and electric motor buddy up in a Turbo S, it’s hard to grumble very much at all. (And don’t forget there’s that GTS for the purists.) As with virtually every hybrid, pure electric is easily sufficient for everyday ambling; the considerable weight of 2,365kg is comparable with similar saloons, as is the 190hp output. It struggles with big inclines or ambitious overtakes, because of course it does. But the Panamera will scoot between traffic lights and join a dual carriageway without any drama as an EV. And there’s proper range now, too, the test car showing 36 miles from just over 70 per cent of a charge. Hybrid Panameras have existed for a while, albeit with one attribute or another not quite right - range, realistically, isn’t one of them in 2025. Particularly with its regen more effective than ever. Once upon a time, a hybrid setting that balanced electric and petrol power to the best efficiency end would have been annoying, but so seamless is the handover of sources now that it becomes a default setting. Actually, that’s a lie, because when you have a Panamera Turbo S for two hours, more often than not it'll be in Sport mode. But when employed, Hybrid’s ability to coast at any opportunity, to cosset and to soothe down the M4, but then also strike up the V8 faster than you can say Sonderwunsch is hugely impressive. And makes the fuel consumption look acceptable (i.e. in the 20s rather than the teens). Doesn’t matter how urgent or forceful your request for V8 assistance is, it’s always on hand and always a lot less flustered than the driver might be. With the engine permanently running in Sport and Sport Plus, the Turbo S is little short of astonishing. This 4.0-litre was always fairly lagless, but with hybrid assistance it's phenomenally responsive; the urge of electrification combined with the charisma of a V8 is mighty persuasive, especially when it’s done so effortlessly. Doesn’t matter the gear, the revs, or the scenario; this Panamera will always pile on acceleration like it’s some kind of all-you-can-eat speed buffet. It’s going to have to be asked to stop way, way before it needs to. Just think of the power that goes into making almost 2.5 tonnes capable of 202 mph, and how it feels to have so much power under such control; it’s like a bullet train, only more lavish. Naturally the V8 provides a more stirring soundtrack than Electric Sport Sound would, though it remains a tad more muted than we’d like in this installation - even with the sports exhaust optioned on. There’s no mistaking the configuration from inside, it’s just a bit too smooth and polished to be truly rousing. Maybe something from the aftermarket (see Bentley’s recent tie-up , with the same powertrain as this car) could bring a little more theatre. Speed and sound aren’t really attributes that the latest range of PHEV ‘bahnstormers’ have struggled with; an M5 also has 738lb ft of system torque and does a reasonable V8 impression. It’s as driver’s cars they’ve not quite hit the bullseye, as the demands of balancing powertrain demands with chassis tech prove a challenge too far. But Porsche appears to have conquered the issue with this Panamera, because it’s just as satisfying to corner as it is to vanquish every bit of straight tarmac. A hybrid AMG brake pedal feel isn’t very nice at all - this is. Firm and confidence-inspiring from the top of the pedal, with a commensurate increase in power through the travel. You’re immediately at ease with the heaviest, most powerful, most expensive Panamera in a way that never quite materialises in the Mercedes. Similarly, four-wheel steering is integrated more cohesively here than in the M5, so there’s complete faith early on. Both BMW and Porsche are very good at nailing apexes and rear-biasing their four-wheel drive, but it’s the Porsche that really encourages that exploration sooner. (And this much torque actually challenges the Panamera in a way lesser powertrains don’t; there’s fun to be had, undoubtedly.) As you might expect, Porsche's Active Ride system plays a crucial role in all this, delivering the sort of composure and tautness that apparently never falters. It says everything that the Turbo S feels like it could rival an M3 for sheer driving entertainment, rather than the M5, such is the clarity of its major controls and willingness to be driven enthusiastically. There’s seemingly no penalty to pay either, as there can be elsewhere, for the benefits of electrification. It’s as sorted as a GTS, if not a little more so, despite carrying so much extra weight. If we're picking holes, perhaps the ride isn’t as sumptuous as it might be. Compared to Active Ride Taycans, there’s always an ever-so-slight fidget underlying the Panamera. It’s far from a dealbreaker, and just about acceptable in a car of such sporting intent, though it does become noticeable when cruising along without the engine running. It’s the sort of pitter-patter that convinces you the car’s been left in an angrier drive mode, only to find out it hasn’t. A modest flaw, really, but a noticeable one. Otherwise, the Turbo S E-Hybrid is outrageously good. It’s a superhero super-saloon for the present day, apparently capable of anything and everything while appearing pretty sober against similar cars. Those queries and qualms that exist around other electrified V8s just don’t materialise here; it’s another great driving Porsche Panamera, with the power of a thousand suns under the bonnet. Little short of compelling, basically, because this latest Panam is already so sorted in every guise. While arguably nobody needs such towering performance from their Porsche, it’s nice to know that the ultimate in unnecessary excellence finally lives up to the billing. Realistically, a Turbo will be more than enough for most - or better yet, the much lighter GTS - but those who insist on going the whole nine yards (or £195,000, in this case) are going to be absolutely blown away. 3,996cc twin-turbo V8 with electric motor, 21.8kWh (usable) lithium-ion battery 8-speed dual-clutch PDK, all-wheel drive 600@N/Arpm (782 system peak, 190hp electric motor) 590@N/Arpm (738 system peak) 2.9 seconds (with Sport Chrono) 202 mph (87 mph in electric) 2,365 kg 201.8 (WLTP, 53 miles Estimated All Electric Range) 32 g/km (WLTP) £175,100 (price as standard; price as tested £195,451 comprising Madeira Gold Metallic for £0, Leather interior in black with interior package Turbonite for £0, Ventilated front seats for £914, Front seat ISOFIX for £154, SportDesign package for £4,313, Panoramic roof system for £1,817, Sports exhaust with dark tailpipes for £2,659, PCCB with high gloss black calipers for £708, Tinted HD Matrix LED lights for £426, Exclusive Design Taillights for £719, Thermally and noise insulated glass including privacy glass for £447, Porsche crest on headrests for £411, Porsche Innodrive with Active Lane Keeping for £1,052, Four-zone automatic climate control for £1,325, Air Quality System for £365, Electric roll-up sunblind for behind rear compartment for £441, Burmester 3D High-End Surround Sound System for £4,600)"
772,Maximum attack with Elfyn Evans | PH Footnote,https://www.pistonheads.com/news/motorsport/maximum-attack-with-elfyn-evans--ph-footnote/50088,Cam Tait,2025-07-20,PistonHeads,"Most car journalists, myself included, believe we’d be semi-decent racing drivers given the time and money to do it properly. Sounds boastful, I know, but racing cars are inherently easy to drive, the tricky bit is finding that extra tenth or two that separates the good from the merely competent. Clearly, there’s no way I could jump into a Formula 1 car or a Le Mans prototype and be as quick as the pros, or even an amateur - but could I put a few laps in without completely embarrassing myself? I’d certainly hope so. Yep, I’ve got the racing driver ego nailed to T, but I know my limits. Put me on a motorbike, for instance, and there’s no way I’d be going any quicker than walking pace. Quite how the MotoGP or TT lot can switch off the part of their brain that says ‘this is a bit dangerous, isn't it? Let's slow down’ is beyond comprehension, and is what makes bike racing so utterly captivating. The other ‘no way I could do that’ sport is rallying, for similar reasons. Sure, the cars are a lot safer these days and they’re not entering each stage completely blind, but with the competition being the closest it’s been in years, the margin for error has been completely eroded. Then there are the cars themselves. Back in 2017, new rules were introduced to drastically increase the pace and drama of the rally machines, effectively initiating a modern-day Group B era. The cars grew wider and sprouted intricate winglets and fairings to keep them planted at the ridiculous speeds they’d be driven through forests, between snowbanks and alongside cliff edges. Then, in 2022, another rules reshuffle all but abandoned their road-car origins in the name of improving safety. So while today’s machines look like a , or Toyota GR Yaris, they’re actually spaceframe silhouettes that just about resemble the road cars they’re named after - just like the Lancia Delta S4, Metro R64 and Peugeot 205 T16. The shakeups have worked, too, at least in terms of mixing up the competition. Sébastien Ogier, Ott Tänak, Kalle Rovanperä and Thierry Neuville have all bagged World Rally Championship titles in the last seven seasons, with Ford, Toyota and Hyundai sharing turns in the limelight. One driver, however, has finished runner-up in four of the last five seasons, getting within inches of the 2020 title before being cruelly denied by a treacherously icy corner in the Rally Monza finale. Toyota’s Elfyn Evans has 11 rally wins to his name and currently leads the 2025 WRC standings, but with Ogier, Rovanperä and Tänak breathing down his neck at the halfway point, it’s hardly his to lose. A misjudged corner, stray rock or even just running first on the road could reshuffle the whole order within a weekend. So the chance to ride shotgun with him up Goodwood hill and around the rally stage in the full-fat WRC car was obviously too good to turn down, though I thought it wise to leave the championship chat to the proper motorsport journalists and instead use the time to get to know Britain’s championship hopeful. Or so I’d thought. Come the morning of the run, Toyota engineers were huddled around the silver-livered Rally1 machine, frantically trying to rectify an issue that they weren’t at liberty to divulge. Fortunately, the green light was given, I was bolted in the second seat, normally occupied by co-driver Scott Martin, and told that the radio between me and Elfyn wasn’t working. Great. Elfyn jumps in and immediately dumps his crash lid at my feet. “Sorry, would you mind looking after this for me?” So I spend the short trip between the Toyota tent and paddock gazing at the green, white and black crash helmet adorned with the Welsh red dragon of the championship leader. Not that I’m able to do much else, because Elfyn’s far too busy revving the rally-bred, four-cylinder (not the production three-pot) to its limits for the crowds that had gathered. “Is this the hybrid car?”, I shout. Elfyn proceeds to tell me that it was, but is now used as a marketing car so has had its battery removed, just like the current iteration of WRC machine. We get to the paddock and Elfyn jumps out for a quick chat with teammate Sami Pajari. I remain locked in place like a toddler in a car seat, unable to move and feeling even more useless than I normally do. A couple of mins later, Elfyn jumps back in, notices the cable for the helmet’s mic is the wrong way round and swaps the leads over. Now in contact, I ask him how the current cars compare to the 2017-spec Yarises, which sat far closer to their production counterparts. To my surprise, he says he’d take the older cars over the current ones as they were lighter and more agile, while admitting he never really gelled with the hybrids (and that’s reflected by a couple of seasons where he was a little off the pace). They’re better without batteries, he says, as they are this year, but they’re still just shy 1,200kg, and can feel a little lazy to turn in. Not what you want when dancing from hairpin to hairpin in Rally Monte. The signal is given to head to the start line and the engine roars into life. It’s only now that I notice the switches on the co-driver’s kick plate, one of which operates the whispers and another for the electric cutoff. Keeping my feet firmly planted in the centre of the plate should be easy, but as we head down the hill to the start line, Elfyn’s pinning the throttle, which, in full gravel spec, pitches the nose up, before hitting the brakes and bringing the nose down towards the tarmac. At the same time, he’s frantically weaving left and right to generate some tyre heat. If that sounds like a recipe for car sickness, it is. Good thing I don’t suffer from motion sickness and consider myself an easy passenger, but the gyroscopic motion of constant acceleration, braking and weaving was immensely uncomfortable. Fortunately, our run was so early I’d yet to eat breakfast, otherwise I’d have likely made a right mess of the inside of our championship hopeful’s million-pound rally car. A quick handbrake turn at the spot where you’re not allowed to do it anymore (the bit where everyone bins it) and we’re waiting for our turn up the hill. As I’m collecting myself, I ask Elfyn about what the path into the WRC looks like. Circuit racing typically involves years of karting before progressing through the single-seater, GT or prototype ladders. But rallying? “I always tell people that to go rallying, you have to really want to go rallying”, says Elfyn, with a smile on his face. “Some people just want to get in for the lifestyle”, he adds. But the ladder is far from glamorous, explaining how he competed in the odd national rally before entering the Fiesta Sport Trophy (racing a rally-prepped version an ST similar to mine), which he won in 2011. That earned him a ticket into the WRC Academy in 2012 and factory outings in the WRC a year later, all while supporting his family’s business back home in Wales. His first stage win came in the monstrous Fiesta RS WRC in 2017, before moving to his current home at Toyota in 2020. Our chat is swiftly interrupted by the Rally2 GR Yaris heading off on its run up the hill. As we edge closer to the start line, Elfyn twists a dial on the steering wheel, ‘race 1’ appears on his small LED dash and the engine revs jump immediately to a higher idle. We’re ready for the start. The light turns green, Elfyn ups the revs for a rally start, and away we go. The nose rises once again, pinning me to the back of my seat. The acceleration is astonishing as Elfyn pulls at the sequential shifter to the right of the steering wheel for another gear. Then another. And another. Turn one, a relatively tight right-hander that opens into a small straight, arrives and he gets the nose in early, shifting the weight to the left-hand side while taking a huge chunk out of the inside turn. We’re then in full view of Goodwood House, which can only mean one thing: donuts. Elfyn yanks the handbrake like a shotgun trigger, turning the car 180 degrees before opening the throttle up. The cabin fills with tyre smoke and the smell of burning rubber, and I make the mistake of looking out the side window, which instantly throws you off balance. Note to self: look straight ahead for donuts. We then do another 720 (or maybe 1440?) further up the hill, which Elfyn effortlessly styles out to complete the run. The rest of the climb doesn’t feel quite as rapid as the start, but it’s rare for rally cars to be in an environment as open or straight as Goodwood hill. Besides, we were set up for the forest rally stage, which was next on the agenda. After crossing the line, Elfyn subjected me to yet more donuts for the crowd at the top of the hill, and then exited stage right for the rally paddock. A quick stop at the service area, where Toyota World Rally Team boss was gearing up for a run in his GR-liveried Celica ST185 WRC car, and we were back out for stage 2. I ask Elfyn if he’s going to give it the beans now that he’s woken up a bit. He laughs, but concedes he’s not interested in setting times. “It’s a technical stage with a very chalky surface”, he says. “It’s almost impossible in the wet, but even in the dry it’s incredibly slippery.” You could've fooled me. We launch off the line and immediately take a blind, sharp left and hurtle towards the depths of the forest stage. He wasn’t kidding when he said it was technical, with high dirt verges and endless sharp turns, all aiming to catch the very best out. Elfyn, meanwhile, isn’t just clipping apexes: he’s devouring them, vaulting over the dirt banks as if they weren’t there. Here, the Rally1 Yaris feels insanely fast, quicker than anything I’ve experienced (and I’d been up the hill in the 1,079hp Aston Martin Valhalla the day before), almost to the point where it felt too big for the course. How Elfyn made it out the other end, with the commitment he was carrying into each corner, just shows how hugely talented rally drivers are. And tough, too. You’d think with all that suspension travel that the ‘Yaris’ glides through the stage like Aladdin’s magic carpet. Nope. It’s utterly brutal, shocks echoing through the body and seat as we clatter over rocks and potholes. Nothing, however, could prepare me for the jump towards the end of the stage. It doesn’t look all that bad on video, but in the cockpit it is positively violent. All your organs begin to float around in your body as you take off, engine screaming at maximum revs all the while, which is what I imagine astronauts feel rocketing into space for the first time. Then, on re-entry, the car slams back onto the ground, the force of which is absorbed by your backside and spine. It’s deeply unpleasant, but at the same time of course, epic. Adrenalin pumping, we cross the line and trundle our way back to the service area. I shake Elfyn’s hand and thank him for one heck of a ride, before letting another journalist have their turn in the hot seat. Hats off to Elfyn’s co-driver Scott, who has to endure four days worth of punishment 14 times a year, with some stages taking up to 30 minutes to complete, all while reading pace notes. Elfyn, meanwhile, is obviously a proper talent, and a lovely chap at that, as is the case with so many rally people. There’s none of the gamesmanship you find in, say, Formula 1, and none of the egos, either. I don’t get the impression he’s in it for glory, and certainly not for fame; he’s in it to be the best at one of the world’s most challenging sports. And for that, I am in awe, just as I have been since watching Richard Burns win Britain’s last WRC title back in 2001. Here’s hoping that Elfyn will join the list come the end of Rally Saudi Arabia in late November. Rallying, you’ve just got to love it."
